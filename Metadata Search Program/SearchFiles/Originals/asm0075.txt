Letter from P.L. Watson to F.S. Morse, June 6, 1917, regarding a survey of property east of Biscayne Bay		Watson, P. L.	Morse, Frederick S., 1859-1920	Surveyor Watson of Llewellyn Engineering Co. informs Frederick Morse of difficulties surveying an area of 3,250 acres east of Biscayne Bay. He theorizes that the original governmental survey of the township was "faked" rather than properly mapped. Watson proposes that his company undertake a survey of the whole township of Miami Beach as a service to the various parties interested in the division of its properties.

Something new and good to eat			Dorn, Mabel White; Dorn Brothers Company; Dorn, Harold; Dorn, Robert	Probable authors are Mabel White Dorn and the Dorn brothers. The book promotes the excellence of avocado, mango, and citrus fruits and of the soil and climate of Dade County for growing them. The final few pages sing the praises of South Miami and introduce the reader to the Dorn Brothers Company and their activities.	South Miami (previously known as Larkins) pioneers, inventors, and developers Robert and Harold Dorn built some of the city's earliest buildings: a post office, a bank, a drugstore. Harold was one of the first Aldermen of South Miami, and Robert was a member of the Town Council and the School Board. Robert's wife, Mary Wheeler Dorn, was a charter member of the Cocoplum Women's Club. Harold's wife, Mabel White Dorn, collaborated with Marjory Stoneman Douglas on books about fruits and vegetables native to South Florida.

Letter from Pepper to Hoffman, November 9, 1926, regarding lease and sale of farmlands		Pepper, Frank J., b. 1880	Hoffman, J. W.	Model Land Company sales agent Frank Pepper writes to vice-president J.W. Hoffman about the possibilities of renting Company lands to farmers in the vicinity of Miami. He explains that Company policy in the past was not to rent lands "for the reason that most croppers would rather pay rent on new land for a couple of years, and then drop it and hunt other new land," besides which, they always had difficulties with trespassers. However, there is little virgin land remaining, and farmers are willing to rent. The crops he mentions are peppers, beans, and tomatoes.

Morse, Frederick S., 1859-1920	Dr. Burkhart writes to Model Land Company sales agent Frederick Morse that he has "a plan devised, by which to lease with the privilege of purchasing or selling on a long time pay-ment, 10 acres of fruit land, and 10 acres of [marl] land; this gets a man interested in both fruit growing and trucking, as this is the only way a man can do well in Florida, then he can do trucking in the Winter and his fruit growing in the Summer ... My plan of advertising I believe is very successful, I have over One Thousand applicants" to lease land from him.		Land use; Agriculture; Burkhart, W. S.

Letter from Sidney Harrison to Frederick Morse, August 13, 1912, concerning sale of land to Burkhart		Harrison, Sidney	Morse, Frederick S., 1859-1920	Model Land Company chief clerk Sidney Harrison writes to sales agent Morse regarding Burkhart's plan to purchase a thousand acres of Company lands, which would be divided into lots of ten acres, half for fruit growing and half for marl land. Harrison, aware that Burkhart is a patent medicine salesman, expresses some distrust: "I have read Dr. Burkhart's letter and must confess I am not very favorably impressed by it. It seems to me more or less a 'blowing of his own horn' too loudly." He adds, "As far as leasing his own land is concerned we have nothing to do with it, but under no circumstances would we agree to his leasing our land nor would we sell it to him on long term payment." Harrison says that they must await vice-president Ingraham's decision.		Land use; Burkhart, W. S.	Commercial correspondence		1912-08-13	1912	Florida.

This is the last letter in a series of Model Land Company correspondence concerning sales of various lots to Clifford Kraper, who throughout the year of 1927 had difficulty paying his mortgages.

Paddock and Donald C. Caddigan for a ten-acre tract adjoining Kendall Grove. The Company "decided that we should try to make an exchange with these people for this land to some other location so that at least the west five acres of this tract could be taken over by the Model Land Company and included in their reservation strip which runs around the grove as a protection against disease, fire and other objectionable features." County Commissioner John J. Hinson "is very anxious that this corner be reserved from sale as a protection to his grove, and we agree with him for the reason it is hard to tell just when some of these new investment companies springing up every day may get hold of the property, sub-divide it into lots and sell it off to northern people, or if a grove should be planted the owners would want to use Hinson's rock road the full length of the Kendal Grove."

Memo by Frank Pepper regarding Deering estate in Cutler		Pepper, Frank J., b. 1880		Model Land Company sales agent Frank Pepper records his dealings with Mrs. Sarah R. W. Palmer (granddaughter of Henry Perrine), a resident of Cutler and next-door neighbor to Charles Deering. Deering proposed to the County that a street to the waterfront should be closed, so that he could dredge out a basin. However, Palmer and other neighbors objected to closing the street, although they were apparently afraid "to antagonize Mr. Deering." Pepper concludes, "My candid opinion is that she thinks Mr. Deering will buy this property from her and pay her $30,000.00, her price, and this is the whole end that she is working to."

Yesterday we had to take our horses from the wagon and lead them across the worst part of the Benson prairie and then pull the wagon to them, as the bridge across the prairie about the center of the West bdy. of sec. 22 was gone, burned I believe. I first took him to the grove at Kendall and John Hinson told him all about it. Today I shall take him to Homestead, so that he can see how fruit trees grow in the rock."	John J.
