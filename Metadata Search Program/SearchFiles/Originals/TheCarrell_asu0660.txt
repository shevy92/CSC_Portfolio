The First Issue																																asu0660000001	THE  CARRE LL  Volume I JUNE   1960 Number I  THE FIRST ISSUE  The Volume I Number I imprint on a new journal declares  the birth of a purpose and promises to give it continuity. The  purpose of The Carrell is to make known the notable collections  in the University of Miami Library, to evaluate them through the  eyes of area scholars, to relate print to people.  Choice of the name carrell—a small alcove in a library for  individual study—reflects a resolve that the voice of the Friends  will sound the praise of reading and quiet reflection.  The lineage of The Carrell may be traced back to the beginning of the Century when Theodore Spicer-Simson turned  to medallic portraits as his metier. His 300 medallions, correspondence with the Edwardian sitters and his memoirs add the  durability of bronze to a literary epoch. Margaret Spicer-Simson,  companion of the sculptor's creative half century, has placed  the Collection in the hands of the University of Miami Library,  looking toward eventual acquisition.  This year four Spicer-Simson Lectures were held. Two of the  speakers, Padraic Colum and Robert Frost, were themselves  modelled in bronze by Spicer-Simson. Two other lecturers, Alis-  tair Cooke and Edward Davison spoke, respectively, on H. L;  Mencken and Hervey Allen, both of whom Spicer-Simson had  delineated in metal. The format of lectures based on those who  sat to Spicer-Simson will be continued.  Associations of Friends of the Library at older universities  have enriched the shelves of their institutions. To them we are  indebted both for the concept of a band of brothers in literature  and for the Chronicle and Journal prototypes of The Carrell.

Theodore Spicer-Simson					Hockey, Lawrence W.																											asu0660000001	THEODORE SPICER-SIMSON  By Lawrence W. Hockey  TTHEODORE SPICER-SIMSON was in his early thirties, and already secure in his standing as a sculptor, when,  in 1903, he made his decision to concentrate on medallic  portraiture. Although he continued to work in stone from time  to time, the transition was abrupt and permanent. Few artists  have such disparate works in their repertory as Spicer-Simson's  eight-foot statue of the Maharajah of Bobbili, done in his first  period, and the four-inch medallic portrait of Frederick Watts,  R.A., which he modelled from life in 1904.  We must applaud that choice to revive the art of medallic  portraiture, lost since the Renaissance. From the artist it demanded all the skill of draftsmanship and modelling acquired  since boyhood. For him it opened up half a century of an entirely congenial pursuit, the delineation of character on the miniature yet enduring surface of a bronze medallion.  Posterity thereby gained more than 300 medallic portraits  of the great and near great of Europe and America, from the  Victorian era to our own times. In the palm of one's hand one  may let the light play on the strong features of Joseph Conrad,  the broad brow of George Meredith, the living likeness of Robert Frost or Alexander Graham Bell.  I am given to understand that Theodore Spicer-Simson will  be memorialized in a forthcoming book. In reporting here my  impressions of Spicer-Simson, acquired over the years of our  friendship, I shall confine myself to what I learned from him  of his objectives and methods in creating medallic portraits.  Spicer-Simson was a perfectionist, taking a proper pride and  pleasure only in first class work. On one occasion, dissatisfied  with a completed bronze medallic portrait of the Prime Minister  of Saxe Coburg and Gotha, he threw it into the Thames from  Battersea Bridge, thereby ensuring that it would be of no avail  to alter his judgment.  Before he found his metier, he had turned his versatile hand  to many forms of art, including book-plates, illustration, designs,  inscriptions and drawing. Most of these endeavors were con- 	asu06600000010004001							65521480 Bytes	3829	5702	2828547634	RGB	8	600	asu06600000010004001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/243	243	244.jp2	/asu0660/image/244.jp2
Theodore Spicer-Simson					Hockey, Lawrence W.																											asu0660000001	genial pot boiling. His first love was sculpture, and in that profession he had been encouraged by such masters as Jean Paul  Lawrens, Jean Dampt and Auguste Rodin.  Protected by his own stern self-criticism from releasing anything but his finest work, and amply possessed of skill, his foray  into the field of medallic portraits won immediate approval. Of  the 1904 Watts medallion, L. Forrer's Biographical Dictionary  of Medallists states:  The Watts medallion, executed in the style of the  early Renaissance school, is a bold piece of work,  which reminds one of a portrait by Pisanello. The  likeness is highly realistic and dignified, and  might have been designed by Watts himself. The  lofty forehead, the eyes in their deep sockets, the  strong Roman nose, every feature expressive of  keenness of mind, denote the great artist.  From 1903 onward, Spicer-Simson went from strength to  strength; and many great men, of world wide fame, were portrayed in enduring bronze. Statesmen, artists, poets, authors,  musicians, philosophers, scientists, inventors, business men, industrialists and lovely women had their essential character depicted in relief. Among a distinguished company may be mentioned: President William Howard Taft and President Franklin  D. Roosevelt, King Albert and Queen Elizabeth of Belgium,  Ignace Paderewski, General Horace Porter, Henri Caro Del-  vaille, Lyonel Feininger, Robert Bridges, Thomas Hardy, George  Meredith, John Masefield, W. B. Yeats, Lady Gregory, James  Joyce, James Stephens, G. Bernard Shaw, Walter de la Mare,  G. K. Chesterton, H. G. Wells, Arnold Bennett, John Galsworthy, Joseph Conrad, W. H. Hudson, W. H. Davies, C. M.  Doughty, Edwin Arlington Robinson, Sherwood Anderson, Her-  vey Allen, Robert Frost, J. H. Fabre, Count Hermann Keyserling,  Selma Lagerlof, Pol Neveux, George Courteline, Wilbur Wright,  Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas A. Watson, Lord Rutherford,  Frederick Soddy, John B. White, Henry Ford, Andrew Carnegie,  Rudolph H. Wurlitzer, and Abdu'l Baha, the religious leader.  This is a representative list—one hardly to be rivaled as it stands  —yet there are many other equally famous people who have  been finely portrayed by Spicer-Simson. 	asu06600000010005001							65917452 Bytes	3900	5632	3223515889	RGB	8	600	asu06600000010005001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/244	244	245.jp2	/asu0660/image/245.jp2
Theodore Spicer-Simson					Hockey, Lawrence W.																											asu0660000001	Let us consider his methods, technique and effects. First, there  is a valid artistic reason for the circular shape of the setting,  about which Spicer-Simson wrote:  Visually, the shape of a coin or medal is very  important, for no form attracts the sight so strongly to itself as the circle. The eye is held within that  shape, for the outline has no angle to draw the  attention away from the centre. This is all to the  advantage of the subject depicted therein, but the  form that can rotate like a wheel has no natural  position or angle from which it can be examined,  unless the design possesses a real feeling of gravity. This attribute should be obtained by the artist  through the lines and space-divisions of the composition to give it counterpoise and a static  quality.  Before he actually started on a portrait, Spicer-Simson used  to take a small plaquette of wood (or aluminium, in climates  where wood might warp or buckle), and this he covered with  a thin layer of plasticine, as foundation. He considered that the  Italian product was best for his purpose, as it does not harden  or dry out like clay, nor does it get a thin skin like wax, but  remains and retains the same consistency throughout.  Then, he drew the profile of the sitter. The placing of the  portrait in the circle, forward or back, based on the rim or above,  depended upon his interpretation of the character of the person  portrayed. The portrait is not placed exactly in the centre. Its  positioning is a matter of careful consideration and demands  meticulous judgment. If it is wrongly placed in the circle, the  portrait looks wrong; it is to Spicer-Simson's credit that all his  portraits look just right. The proportion of the head to the circle  is also carefully judged, while the head is represented in a characteristic attitude. The profile is selected because it has more  angles than a three-quarter or full face, which is simply an oval,  and an oval in a circle has not much character or interest. It is  also more natural to depict the profile, for prominent features  can be better reproduced in relief in this position.  For modelling, Spicer-Simson used wooden or ivory tools,  of his own devising and shaping, the result of experiment, and 	asu06600000010006001							66712660 Bytes	3900	5700	23531163	RGB	8	600	asu06600000010006001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/245	245	246.jp2	/asu0660/image/246.jp2
Theodore Spicer-Simson					Hockey, Lawrence W.																											asu0660000001	of course, a good deal of delicate work with his long, fine, sensitive fingers. In building up the portrait relief, he used tiny pieces  of plasticine, sometimes no bigger than a pin head; and, working  with skill, care and patience, he obtained those subtle and lifelike effects which give his subjects immortality.  In working in the plastic materia—plasticine, wax or clay—  the artist must be able to visualize the final effect desired when  the work is cast in the metal. He must also decide which metal  will give the best result. Therefore, he must have the skill and  judgment to know how far to go and when to stop. Spicer-Simson  had this power.  When the plasticine portrait was completed to his satisfaction,  a plaster case was made. Then came the process of the lettering  or inscription. This was cut, in reverse, in the plaster; and, once  this was done, the portrait was ready for casting in metal.  How did he obtain his effects? By necessity, he relied to a great  extent on his excellent draughtsmanship and his exceptionally  fine and subtle modeling. Much of his power lay in his technique  which made intelligent use of suggestion in his medallic portraits.  To suggest something of the sitter's character or personality, he  employed high or low relief. Generally speaking, a masculine  portrait should have bolder relief than a feminine one in which  low relief should suggest womanly qualities, for low relief gives  "extremely delicate tone and shadow to the features"; while a  strong, virile or aggressive character should be portrayed in more  vigorous relief than that of a person of gentle disposition.  The style and placing of the lettering were also carefully considered in order to convey the greatest suggestive effect. Whether  it was small or large, severe or plain or ornate or decorative,  light or heavy, was decided by the artist in accordance with his  idea of the character of the sitter, and this affected the general  style of the portrait. Usually, the lettering was placed around the  rim, as in a coin; but, occasionally, it was cut at right angles to  the portrait. Rarely, as in the George Meredith portrait, there  was no lettering or inscription. It was a matter for the artist's  discretion.  Suggestive use was also made of the background. Medallic  portraiture is well adapted for peoples of all ages. What the artist  sought was character, and character is more obvious in mature 	asu06600000010007001							64162416 Bytes	3750	5700	3852107657	RGB	8	600	asu06600000010007001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/246	246	247.jp2	/asu0660/image/247.jp2
Theodore Spicer-Simson					Hockey, Lawrence W.																											asu0660000001	persons than in youth. Spicer-Simson had a highly developed  memory for form and construction. I have known him to do the  portrait of a lady whom he met casually at tea-time and surprise  her with the result. For a young face the background was smooth;  by these contrasts Spicer-Simson was able to give an effect of  beauty to the whole relief.  One of the greatest difficulties in sculpture and medallic portraiture is to convey the effect and illusion of sight. When an  artist works in pencil or in colour, it is easy enough to suggest  sight, mainly through representing the open eyes with light shining upon the iris. This is impossible in sculpture and medallic  portraiture, in stone or metal, where light cannot be so represented. As a consequence, many statues and busts appear blind.  Except in the case of Herr Gootlieb, who actually was blind,  Spicer-Simson's portraits, whether in sculpture or medallic work,  always appear to be endowed with sight; for he had learnt the  secret of suggesting sight by the true and correct setting of the  eyes-—the suggestive use of lines, wrinkles and muscles, and the  sitter's concentration upon a distant object beyond the immediate  frame of the portrait. His sitters appear to be looking at something. Thus, in the Bernard Shaw portrait, a twinkle is suggested  in the eye by the wrinkles around it. Caro Delvaille is gazing at  something in the near distance. Lyonel Feininger is looking intently and with concentration at a nearer object just outside the  actual frame.  In his treatment of hair, Spicer-Simson had to convey a general impression, for it is impossible to delineate hair in detail;  therefore, he had to suggest it by depicting it in strands, locks,  waves or a characteristic fall. His suggestion of hair is invariably  finely done, as may be observed in the portraits of Ada Galsworthy, Selma Lagerlof, Mrs. Cyrus H. McCormick, Louise  Strong Hammond, Sherwood Anderson, G. K. Chesterton, Robert Bridges and Thomas A. Watson; while his treatment of beards  is also excellent, as is revealed in the representative portraits of  Robert Bridges, C. M. Doughty and AE (George Russell).  Here, it is interesting to note how favourable are medallic portraits to the bald-headed person. Spicer-Simson's treatment of the  dome is very attractive, giving an appearance of dignity.  Theodore Spicer-Simson sometimes employed symbols to sug- 	asu06600000010008001							64513436 Bytes	3821	5626	4285122632	RGB	8	600	asu06600000010008001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/247	247	248.jp2	/asu0660/image/248.jp2
Theodore Spicer-Simson					Hockey, Lawrence W.																											asu0660000001	gest work or interests of his sitters. With the portrait of John  Masefield appears a ship, suggesting his love of the sea and his  sea poetry. James Stephens is pictured with a crock and a shamrock, representing his Crock of Gold, his initials and his Irish  origin. The work of W. H. Davies is symbolized by a daisy, for  his simple nature poetry; and Wilbur Wright is depicted against  a background of birds and the sky, suggesting his interest in flight  and his work as an aeronaut. Spicer-Simson deplored the passing  of symbols, for they speak a language of their own: the lion indicating courage; the dove, peace; the anchor, hope; the oak  tree, strength and endurance; the cross, the Christian religion;  and so on; and, though many symbols have vanished, he revived  their use in some of his portraits.  Theodore Spicer-Simson put a power of expression, meaning  and character into his medallic portraits of which some of the  special attributes should be mentioned. Consider the delicate  and life-like texture of the ageing skin of Lady Gregory; the  eye, nose, beard, complexion and gentle expression of Robert  Bridges; the knit brows of Paderewski, suggesting intense concentration; the meditative attitude, the noble dome and hawk-like  nose of Thomas Hardy; the gaze into space and the stiff thrust  of shoulders and arms of the one-time sea-farer, Joseph Conrad;  the human kindness of Selma Lagerlof; the womanly loveliness  of his wife, Margaret Spicer-Simson; the resemblance of George  Meredith to an old biblical prophet; and the finely moulded,  dainty lips of the women and some of the men. These are but  a few of the many excellences of the work of Spicer-Simson and  they serve to draw attention to some of the particular aspects  and beauties of his portraits which are all worth separate study,  so that each one may be analyzed, examined, and appreciated  on its own intrinsic merits.  As I have indicated, the ideal way to examine a medallic portrait is to take it in the hand; then, by allowing the light to play  upon its surface, to notice how the relief changes, so that the  different planes and aspects of the modelling are revealed, bringing different features into prominence, thus changing the expression of the portrait.  The Biographical Dictionary of Medallists and Engravers Ancient and Modern carries this authoritative opinion: 	asu06600000010009001							65479328 Bytes	3827	5700	1805645335	RGB	8	600	asu06600000010009001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/248	248	249.jp2	/asu0660/image/249.jp2
Theodore Spicer-Simson					Hockey, Lawrence W.																											asu0660000001	Mr. Spicer-Simson is always vigorous without  being insensitive to the charms of detailed definition. He has a remarkable faculty for catching the  right moment and the right pose which, coupled  with a reserve in treatment and an absence of  anything pertaining to mannerism,  makes  his  portraits still more interesting . . . The various  sides of his art have been developed together; his  skill of craftsmanship is guided by his aesthetic  sentiment, based on the study of the great masters  of history. He is true to himself, and holds among  our modern masters a place which but few artists  can claim to share.  Theodore  Spicer-Simson  was  tall, thin,  dignified,  ascetic-  looking, with a noble face and the eyes of a mystic, penetrating,  all-seeing. He was a visionary who saw not only the outward  aspect of his subjects but  also something of their essential  character which he worked into his portraits.  He was a man of rectitude, kind, generous, sincere, a gentle  soul and a true friend. Cultured, widely and deeply read in many  branches of literature, he was intensely interested in poetry.  As an artist, Theodore Spicer-Simson took a proper pride in  his work and knew its merit. He loved his art and delighted in  it. It brought him many honors, and he was pleased when his  work was praised; but he never boasted about it, for he was  modest and had the humility of greatness.

The Eder Collection					Selle, Mildred H.																											asu0660000001	THE EDER COLLECTION  By Mildred H. Selle  A COLLECTION OF BOOKS and pamphlets centered  around the history and culture of Colombia has been  presented to the Library by Phanor J. Eder, together  with a quantity of correspondence and photostatic copies of  documents from the files of his father, Santiago M. Eder, lawyer,  industrial pioneer in the Cauca Valley, and a nineteenth-century  Consul representing the United States in Colombia. Numbering  some thirteen hundred pieces, apart from the correspondence,  this rich collection will lend substantial support to research in  the whole field of Latin American history and will enhance the  Library's holdings in Floridiana and Americana.  Voyages and discoveries form an important part of the  collection, contemporary accounts revealing the excitement  attending the early contacts with new ways of life, telling the  tale of storm, landfall, hostile Indians, claims by rival adventurers, and dire hazards at sea or ashore in a strange land. The  earliest of these accounts is the 1533 edition of De rebus  Oceanicis & Orbe Nouo tres ... of Peter Martyr, a book that  presents the findings of Martyr's contemporaries and friends,  Columbus, Vasco de Gama, Cortez, Magellan, Cabot, and  Vespuccius on their voyages to the New World. Hakluyt's Divers  Voyages ... of 1582 is in this collection in facsimile. A quarter  of a century later, in 1617, Samuel Purchas, in Purchas his Pilgrimage, deals at length with the Indians of the New World as  does Fr. Gregorio Garcia in his Origen de los Indios de el Nuevo  Mundo, the second and much enlarged edition of his 1607  treatise, dedicated to Saint Thomas Aquinas, and adorned with  an engraving of the Saint kneeling before the crucifix.  From the first half of the eighteenth century come a great  many accounts of voyages to the New World where pristine riches  were compensating for the failure to find a shorter route to the  East. The first French edition and the first Dutch edition, dated  1716 and 1718 respectively, of Frezier's Voyage to the South  Seas are among the accounts in this collection, our copy of the  French edition having been originally in the library of Thomas  Anson of Shugborough, of the family of the navigator George 	asu06600000010013001							64024684 Bytes	3750	5689	1875823110	RGB	8	600	asu06600000010013001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/252	252	253.jp2	/asu0660/image/253.jp2
The Eder Collection					Selle, Mildred H.																											asu0660000001	Anson, whose Voyage Autour du Monde (Geneve, 1750) is in  the collection also. Shelvocke's Voyage Round the World By Way  of the Great South Sea (London, 1726) is a detailed report of  a voyage "in the Speedwell of London, of 24 guns and 100 men,  (under His Majesty's Commission to cruize on the Spaniards in  the late war with the Spanish Crown)," but it is equally an  account of the plant and animal life of the island of Juan  Fernandez where his ship was wrecked. Similar accounts bear  out in sharpest detail the claims of great wealth to be had for  the taking in the New World. From the same period there is a  manuscript diary of the voyage to Cartagena of Prince de Santo  Buono, Viceroy to Peru, dated in Cartagena, March 1716.  Written in a beautiful, neat hand, and finely bound, this is a most  welcome addition to any collection of historical source materials.  Of somewhat later date, Bougainville's Voyage Round the  World appears here in both the first London edition, 1772, and  the first Dublin edition of the same date. Many of the early voyages were "Faithfully Extracted from the Journals of the Voyages," and gathered together in the four-volume set An Historical  Account of All the Voyages Round the World . . . published in  London in  1773-74.  Several other accounts of the eighteenth century are of  especial importance: from the writings of Condamine we have  both the French and the English editions (Paris, 1745, and  London, 1747) of his . . . Voyage made within the Inland Part  of South America, which includes a detailed report of a journey  down the Amazon, and an equally detailed map of the Amazon  and its surrounding country. The work of the two scientists Jorge  Juan and Antonio de Ulloa, on a mission undertaken in cooperation with the French Academicians who were measuring  the equator, was of great signficance to historians and scientists  alike, and is here represented in many editions, the earliest being  the Amsterdam & Leipzig edition of their Voyage Historique de  VAmerique Meridionale (1752). Both Ulloa's Noticias Ameri-  canas (Madrid, 1772) and his Memoires Philosophiques . . .  (Paris, 1787) are in the collection also. At the close of the same  century another scientist, Alexander von Humboldt, journeyed  to the Equinoctial regions for research, spent two years in Colombia, and with his work and the publication of his findings  10 	asu06600000010014001							65681492 Bytes	3890	5625	3842750963	RGB	8	600	asu06600000010014001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/253	253	254.jp2	/asu0660/image/254.jp2
The Eder Collection					Selle, Mildred H.																											asu0660000001	helped to usher in the new scientific age. Of his researches the  present collection includes several important titles.  A review of source materials on nearly any phase of Colombian  history or of the history of the Isthmus reveals the depth and  breadth of this collection. Of the Darien venture alone, that  "magnificent, far-sighted, fore-sighted" scheme of William Pater-  son's, there are no less than ten contemporary accounts, including  the Central America ... of Paterson himself, published in 1857  from a 1701 manuscript in the British Museum. The works of  Lionel Wafer on the Isthmus and on the riches he believed should  be taken (by England) from the region, notwithstanding the  failure of the Scots at Darien, provide an interesting first-hand  account by a narrator who was not a member of the Darien  expedition. Wafer frequently cites the writings of Dampier and  Ringrose (also in this collection). As background to this effort  to settle the Isthmus and control world trade, in addition to  Bucaniers of America and Dampier's Voyages . . . , are the writings of many other early visitors, such as the beautifully illustrated  account of Pedrarias' voyages, written by Antonius de Herrera and  published in the Pieter Van der Aa series. Among the accounts  by participants in the Scots' venture and their critics we find a  pamphlet written "in defence of the Scots Settlement at Darien,"  published under the pseudonym Philo-Caledon; A Defence of the  Scots Abdicating Darien . . . including an answer to the fore-  named "defence"; An Enquiry into the Causes of the Miscarriage  of the Scots Company . . . or An Answer to a Libel entituled A  Defense of the Scots Abdicating Darien; and a pamphlet containing "Original Papers and Letters Relating to the Scots Company."  The last attempt on the part of the English to secure a hold  in this part of Latin America is covered equally well. Vernon's  expedition to Cartagena is represented here in some ten or twelve  contemporary accounts, apart from attention given it in the more  general works of the period. Sir Charles Knowles' An Account of  the expedition . . . ; Cathcart's Letter to the Honourable Edward  Vernon . . . ; the Original Papers Relating to the Expedition to  Carthagena, edited by Vernon; Authentic Papers Relating to the  Expedition against Carthagena . . . ; Original Letters to an Honest  Sailor (to Vernon from Wager and others); The Conduct of  Admiral Vernon Examined and Vindicated . . . are among them.  • 11 	asu06600000010015001							64337828 Bytes	3816	5618	1937929358	RGB	8	600	asu06600000010015001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/254	254	255.jp2	/asu0660/image/255.jp2
The Eder Collection					Selle, Mildred H.																											asu0660000001	t  Especially rich in certain areas, the collection is surprisingly  good in nearly all. Biographies include a very considerable number of the standard, and better, works on Castellanos, Bolivar,  Santander, and Mosquera, as well as on less well-known figures  of Colombia's history. In all, biographies account for perhaps  two hundred titles.  A wide range of materials, including Uricoechea's Lengua  Chibcha, tell the tale of the culture and of the final destruction  of the Chibcha Nation. The collection includes the works of  Triana, Cuervo Marquez, Eugene Ortega, and many other  authorities on the history of the Chibchas.  From earliest times botany has been of paramount interest  to the travellers to Central and South America. Apart from  various works dealing with the career and influence of Mutis, the  collection presents a large body of works by botanists and other  scientists, many of them Colombians of note. It affords an  opportunity to study the works of Triana, Caldas, Zea, Restrepo,  and others; Vergara's Almanaque, and Uribe-Angel's Geografia  de Antioquia and Medicina en Antioquia are among them. A  manuscript history dated 1792, written by one Garcia Panes,  gives a survey of the history of minerals, chiefly copper and tin,  in America from 1560 to 1785, and is only one of many works  concerned with the mineral resources of South America. A rare  work on platinum, Morin's Platine (1758), and some twenty  pamphlets are in this group.  Of nineteenth century travels in Colombia and in its neighboring areas, there are some hundred or more accounts, varying  in emphasis from economics to natural history. The history of  the press in Colombia is reflected in the collection, as is the  intellectual and artistic climate of the country through its entire  history. While Colombian belles lettres does not play an especially  important role by number of titles, it is not omitted, but is present  essentially in bibliography and biography.  12 	asu06600000010016001							65787932 Bytes	3900	5621	2300462380	RGB	8	600	asu06600000010016001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/255	255	256.jp2	/asu0660/image/256.jp2

New Light on the 1492 Voyage of John Cabot					True, David O.																											asu0660000001	NEW LIGHT ON THE 1492 VOYAGE  OF JOHN CABOT  By David O. True  John Cabot arrived in Bristol, England, in the year 1480,  with his wife Mattea and their son Luis. Cabot had spent  17 years in Venice, where he became an expert navigator  and cartographer. In token of his proficiency his citizenship carried the extra right to live and trade abroad, under the  full protection and prestige afforded to Venetians at that time.  After ten years of service with the merchants of this dominant  English center of shipping and trade we find him in 1491 setting  out in the staunch little bark "Matthew" with a crew of twenty  hardy English sailors. This was the first of a series of explorations by Cabot in search for the elusive Isle of Brazil.  This was no ordinary venture. For with him there sailed as  pilot Juan Fernandez, a resident of Terceira in the Azores, who  represented the King of Portugal, just as Cabot sailed under the  authority of Henry VI. This royal benison grew as successive  voyages followed one another each year, as reported by Ambassador Ayala to his Spanish sovereigns.  The 1491 voyage was unsuccessful, but in 1492 they landed  at Hamilton Inlet. In honor of their landfall on June 29th that  place was named Cape Saint Paul and to the land itself Cabot  gave the name Labrador in honor of Fernandez the Portuguese,  who was known as a labrador or land owner, and who had  supplied them with the information concerning what had previously been known as the Isle of Brazil. The governor of  Terceira was Vaz Corte Real, who had sailed on just such a  voyage with the Danes in either 1472 or 1476, when they found  the land beyond Greenland. It was this information about the  route and the land that Fernandez had imparted to John Cabot.  In 1493 they again sailed for the west and this summer they  discovered and explored a small part of the east coast of Newfoundland.  Maps drawn in about 1502-1504 identify these two discoveries, drawn far apart, showing that they had been discovered  on different voyages. Had they been found on the same voyage,  they would have been represented as along the same coast line.  • 13 	asu06600000010020001							65342772 Bytes	3819	5700	372765351	RGB	8	600	asu06600000010020001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/259	259	260.jp2	/asu0660/image/260.jp2
New Light on the 1492 Voyage of John Cabot					True, David O.																											asu0660000001	Labrador, as was told by Alonso de Santa Cruz, was the first  land found by them in the New World.  These discoveries are shown on two Portuguese maps of Juan  Fernandez, known as the British Museum 31316, and the Hamy  King map of the Huntington Library and Art Gallery. They are  also seen on a Latin map of the same date, probably drawn by  Sebastian Cabot, since in 1502 John Cabot no longer lived.  In 1494 they discovered Cape Breton, as shown on the 1544  Paris map and the Sancho Gutierrez map at the Austrian National Library of Vienna, both official maps of Spain.  In either 1495 or 1496 they explored the south coast of  Newfoundland, as shown by the Oliveriani map at Pesaro.  Another map of this same approximate date, known as the  Kunstmann III, contains names for Newfoundland. It and the  Latin map are in the Staatsbibliothek at Munich. In the John  Day letter it is learned that it was not until 1497 that Cabot  sailed continuously from Cape Race to the Great Cape at Hamilton Inlet, when they realized that Newfoundland (Isle of Seven  Cities) and Labrador (Isle of Brazil) were parts of the same  continental coast line.  In 1498 John Cabot sailed with five ships to Long Island  Sound, and from there they followed the coast around the tip  of Florida and explored into the Gulf of Mexico to the vicinity  of Pensacola. These explorations are portrayed on the Cantino-  Canerio series of maps. John Cabot was the Admiral for whom  some of the maps were known as the Admiral's map. Their landfall at Long Island Sound is marked on Mercator's Globe of  1541, specimens of which are at both the National Maritime  Museum at Greenwich and Harvard University, and the Vopell  map of 1558.  The only map extant that appears to have been drawn by John  Cabot himself is considered to be an anonymous map in the  Bibliotheque Nationale at Paris. On it are three conventional  islands representing Labrador, Newfoundland and Cape Breton  in Canada. There are no other representations of continental  North America. From its omission of any Columbus discoveries  its date has usually been estimated at from about 1494 to 1496.  14 	asu06600000010021001							65578044 Bytes	3882	5629	3147704768	RGB	8	600	asu06600000010021001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/260	260	261.jp2	/asu0660/image/261.jp2
Note on David True					M.S.D.																											asu0660000001	NOTE ON DAVID TRUE  In concise words, based on meticulous research, Mr. David  O. True, a director of the Friends of the University Library,  gives new interpretations to the descriptions and maps that  portray the discoveries of John Cabot on the coasts of North  America. Mr. True contends that John Cabot made his first  discovery of the coast of Labrador in June, 1492, thus antedating the discovery of Columbus. He also ascribes an anonymous map now in the Bibliotheque Nationale at Paris, sometimes credited to Columbus, a« the only extant map which can  be attributed to the great map maker, John Cabot himself.  In the space allotted to him he has compressed the results of  fifteen years' study of the relevant documents and maps. Two of  his articles concerning his appraisal of the Cabots were published  in the international cartographers magazine Imago Mundi. Two  more articles will describe these voyages, one of which will  emphasize the maps and the other will be a study of the John  Day letter, recently found in Spain, which describes more  especially the Cabot voyage of 1497.  His collection of more than 200 photographic copies of early  discovery maps was recently microfilmed by Yale University  Library, and a duplicate copy has been presented to the University of Miami Library. His recent lecture to the Friends centered about some of these maps.  Mr. True is a graduate of Colgate University, after which  he did graduate work in historical research at the University of  Chicago. He has been in Miami for many years and was formerly  the president of the Miami University Club. As secretary of  the Historical Society of Southern Florida he edited and published the remarkable first known writing on Florida by the Spaniard  Escalante Fontaneda, now widely used. Besides his information  about maps he has assembled considerable information concerning pirates, the Spanish plate fleets and hidden treasure.

Hervey Allen: A Spicer-Simson Lecture					Davison, Edward																											asu0660000001	HERVEY ALLEN  a spicer-simson lecture  By Edward Davison  WrHEN I came to this country from Scotland in 1925,  the first young American poet I met was Hervey Allen.  It was the beginning of a life-long friendship.  Hervey was an enormous man, not only physically but intellectually and academically. Although in the full mental powers  of his early thirties, he was a permanent casualty of the First  World War in which he received a severe injury to his kneecap.  He was never able to take any sort of serious exercise again.  He was also badly hurt with mustard gas, which affected his  breathing whenever he expended any great deal of energy. His  great frame needed the exercise that he was never able to give  it. Thank God he did not fall at Chateau-Thierry but survived  until he was sixty and gave us all he had time to give us.  Hervey Allen was a man of the most extraordinary learning,  a man with total recall. The last time I saw him, a year or so  before his death, he remembered things which we had done  together, the actual words and occasions, things which the minute  he mentioned I also recalled. He seldom forgot anything. He  once made a most revealing remark to my wife: "You know, the  trouble about me is that everything I think of makes me think of  something else." That is one of the reasons his books ran to  such great length. Yet, while they are episodic books without  any great framework of design, Hervey's books were designed  from the word go.  The City and the Dawn, only one-half completed when he died,  is only part of a design which he published before the first word  was actually written. Anthony Adverse too was planned before  he wrote a word. But it is nevertheless a defect that most of his  books are so long. By the time they arrive at page 1150, many  readers will have forgotten antecedents and allusions. Which is  a pity. I am not saying this in criticism, but in explanation.  The truth of the matter is that his mind was so constituted, his  Note: This text is a redaction of Mr. Davison's lecture and not originally prepared  for written presentation.  16 •  ■Hi 	asu06600000010023001							66556188 Bytes	3942	5626	707003526	RGB	8	600	asu06600000010023001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/262	262	263.jp2	/asu0660/image/263.jp2

Hervey Allen: A Spicer-Simson Lecture					Davison, Edward																											asu0660000001	memory so organized, his knowledge so organized, too, that he  was able to work on a scale denied to most men. The scale was  in his character and his physique, his conversation, and in his  artistic work. He was a great traveler, an encyclopedist, one of  the most voracious readers and the keenest observers I ever knew,  the master of a multitude of small details. He knew how things  worked, what made the wheels go round, why certain acids did  certain things to certain metals. He knew a great deal about  astronomy, he was a geographer par excellence; he knew his way  around the world on the maps of the world. He knew Roman  history as very few men know it, even scholars in the specialized  academic world. He had read all the poets, all the novelists and  historians.  Hervey Allen was human, a man who liked smells and tastes  and sounds and noises and action as well as thought, who liked  walking, looking at the stars and the sea, who liked children, the  beauty of women, and endless conversation. He never turned his  face away, in my knowledge of him, from anything of real human  interest. Above all, he never pretended to like anything he didn't  like* or to dislike anything he did like. That is one of the greatest  attributes a man of letters can have.  One of the chief attributes of Hervey's character, an important  one, was his enormous capacity for affection, both to give it and  receive it. There are certain other aspects in which we might  regard him. First of all, that of the soldier.  Hervey served on the Mexican-Texas border and in France in  the First World War, as early as any man in the United States  Army. He went through some of the fiercest fighting at Chateau-  Thierry under General Pershing when the Germans gradually  were being defeated and turning around. He made himself into  an excellent soldier and wrote excellent books about soldiering.  The first one was Towards the Flame, a war diary. He does not  build himself up in it as a central character, but simply tells what  happened to him as objectively as anyone can who is writing  about war. He wrote without sentimentalizing, without pretending  to be horrified when not horrified. He set down the facts. A much  later soldiering book, Action at Aquila, about a minor skirmish  during the War between the States, is even better. There he brings  to bear all his knowledge of military tactics of men in battle, the  • 17 	asu06600000010026001							73319404 Bytes	3965	6162	1311502630	RGB	8	600	asu06600000010026001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/265	265	266.jp2	/asu0660/image/266.jp2

If I had to choose a book to  orient young recruits and soldiers to battle, I would not give  them any of the usual manuals. I would give them Action at  Aquila and Towards the Flame, because there is more real knowledge of the soldier's character and his need in those books than  in most of the manuals I remember either in the First or Second  World Wars.  We may look also at Hervey from another aspect, that of the  biographer and critic. His earliest important work, still in many  respects one of the most valuable though long-winded books on  the subject, is Israfel or The Life and Times of Edgar Allen Poe,  This was rather unfortunately influenced by the method and  style of Amy Lowell's Life of Keats. These flaws aside, Hervey  had unearthed more new information about Poe and more new  interpretations of Poe than any other biographer. I am not  forgetting that Poe had some quite good biographers. Where  Hervey excelled was in his comprehensive approach. Fie knew of  Poe's general character, the mysteries of his private life, the  missing correspondence, and all the malicious rumors circulated  during the poet's lifetime, his personal habits and behavior, the  rumors about him, some probably all too true and others all too  untrue. Hervey distinguished between them better than anyone  else had done. He did not fall into the error of that time, the great  error of psychoanalytical approach on insufficient evidence.  Israfel, though it could possibly be improved by some kind of  redaction, is still a valuable book, and one illustrative of a point  mentioned before—Hervey's largeness. He was, at that time,  apt to indulge in a too large utterance. He was still young and  fascinated by words. Every time he learned a new word he tried  to use it as soon as he could, when sometimes a simpler or shorter  word might have been better. On the other hand, it is only fair to  say that an author's chief task is to be what he is, to be himself.  Hervey was being himself when he used big words and big ideas.  If he had not followed them he would have been false to himself.  Yet another aspect—Hervey Allen as a teacher. He talked to  me for many hours about the difficulties of teaching bucolic  literature to city boys at Columbia University, boys who had  18- 	asu06600000010027001							73596552 Bytes	3980	6162	4153762759	RGB	8	600	asu06600000010027001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/266	266	267.jp2	/asu0660/image/267.jp2

They thought the poet was being poetical for the sake of  being poetical. At that time critics were saying that in an industrial civilization poets ought to be writing about machines and  not roses, in complete oblivion of the fact that the best poets of  that time, Frost, Hausman, Robinson and others, were just as  apt to write about one thing as another.  He went on to teach at Vassar, and I was there with him.  Hervey taught American Literature and I English Literature.  Some of the same girls were in both our classes, and one of those  girls became Mrs. Hervey Allen. Others were friends of his, and  mine, up to the end of his life, and many are still friends of mine.  I know that American Literature was never better taught. The  same people came back to his courses and would follow him just  as far as they were allowed. Hervey was indefatigable. He would  have them to his house and talk to them for hours after classes  were over. He brought to all this not the bold knowledge of the  graduate school but a first-hand knowledge of what America was,  where it was, what it looked like, what had happened there, a  knowledge derived from general reading and live experience  rather than from academic research. But he had also studied the  documents, the literary history, and creative literature, and had  read all the standard material as well. Above all, he had been all  over the United States and he had used his eyes.  The teaching did not cease in college. It was continued in  private life. I learned more from him than from most men I  have known. I have listened to him talk to his children and to  mine—they still quote him, unconsciously—about the trees they  were sitting under, about the kind of grass where they were  walking, how things worked, what makes the wheels go round—  the kind of practical education that always goes hand in hand  with the best kind of theoretical education.  Hervey Allen is most widely remembered as an historical  novelist. I must say that I think he excelled in this more than  in any of the other areas that I have mentioned. He excelled  because he took hold of the historical novel, as it were, with  both hands. The historical novel had always been a rather  bastard sort of creation even in the hands of its originator, Sir  Walter Scott, partly because it had to rely entirely upon words.  • 19 	asu06600000010028001							64995936 Bytes	3840	5640	327779481	RGB	8	600	asu06600000010028001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/267	267	268.jp2	/asu0660/image/268.jp2
Hervey Allen: A Spicer-Simson Lecture					Davison, Edward																											asu0660000001	t  It was written for an audience that knew very little about history  or the background of history. Scott probably knew more than  any other man of his time about what kind of costumes were worn  in various historical eras, about how the people talked, what their  idiom was and the minutiae of daily Ufe in past times.  I recall encountering that difficulty myself when teaching 18th  Century novelists. Students could not conceive of a world in  which there were no telephones, no gramophones, no radios, electric lights, sanitation, no water closets, no street cleaning, no  police, no street lights at night. It was almost impossible to make  them understand what happened when one walked down the  street in London at midnight in 1842.  Today we know a great deal that Scott's audience did not know  about social life in various periods, about the daily sounds and  conditions of life. We have also been aided for a long time now  by the use of illustrations. None of Scott's books were illustrated  until after he died.  The movies also helped. I remember how as a little boy in  England, who had read "Buffalo Bill" in the paper-back dime  books, I went to the first American movies and saw what the  Western landscape was really like. Similarly, today, a film is set  in Rome, Florence, the Arctic, South Carolina. There is the  background, so we have come to a stage where it is probably no  longer necessary to describe many things that were formerly  described.  That was where Hervey Allen really did a remarkable thing  because, although he is very long-winded at times and very  detailed, he does not describe unnecessarily. In that, I believe,  he made history. You can go to Scott and take out whole pages  on what somebody wore, or how they walked down the streets,  without disturbing the tale. But with Anthony Adverse and City  and the Dawn this is not true at all. When he describes the wagon  taking Salathiel over the Pennsylvania countryside through the  depths of winter, he is not telling you anything that could be  better told in a picture. One of the greatest lies in the world,  generally ascribed to Confucius, says that one picture is worth a  thousand words. There are two questions to be asked—whose  picture? whose words?  We come last of all to Hervey as a poet.

Hervey Allen: A Spicer-Simson Lecture					Davison, Edward																											asu0660000001	claim him as one of the great poets of his time; but he is one  of the most neglected good poets of this century. He is one of  those poets who continued a previously existing tradition on  more or less conventional lines. I can perhaps put it best by  citing one of his narrative poems, Sarah Simon. This is about  the life of a Negro woman living on an Atlantic island, about her  young girlhood, growing up and being married, her children, the  loss of her fisherman husband, about a strange foreign sailor  coming out of the sea in a storm and marrying her, only to  disappear after a number of years; about her building up an  estate and becoming wise in all things and living to a great old  age, but losing her children and everything she had, yet dying  in the fulfillment of a really satisfying and happy and rich life.  Now this poem is written in the manner of Wordsworth and  Tennyson but without any of the kind of awkwardness that both  were only too apt to admit. There are things in Enoch Arden,  for instance, which good as it is, give one gooseflesh.  Perhaps a poet like Hervey or myself is fortunate to have had  somebody commit the errors before he arrived on the literary  scene. Hervey, in the poem I have just mentioned, was derivative,  yes, imitative to some extent, yes, but not in his matter, only in  a general manner.  You will not find this to be true in his first important book,  Earth Moods. There he made the mistake many poets made in  our time; he took astronomical and geographical units too large  to be discussed in particular terms. Most of these poems are  really too long. He is a little uncomfortable in this world of  geography and space and light and scientific ideas. The dimensions of the poems are too large for his grasp. Yet he was learning.  In his next book, New Legends, he deals with some enormous  conceptions that are less often too large to seize. Geology, astronomy, time in the astronomical sense, are most difficult subjects  for a poet to handle. When you get down to planetary relationships you must possess a very special kind of skill and imagery.  Frost has done it, Shelley did it a number of times, but Hervey  rarely. In Earth Moods one passage in "Funeral at High Tide"  speaks of "the lungs of the marshes inhaling the tide alive and  deeply breathing in her sleep ..." When you have to give the  earth a chest and lungs the going becomes uncomfortable.  • 21 	asu06600000010030001							64996228 Bytes	3840	5640	2213610409	RGB	8	600	asu06600000010030001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/269	269	270.jp2	/asu0660/image/270.jp2
Hervey Allen: A Spicer-Simson Lecture					Davison, Edward																											asu0660000001	J'  In every poem the important thing, really, is where the poet  stands. Is he inside or outside the poem, looking at these things  through his own eyes or someone else's eyes? In too many of  these poems Hervey is looking at them through nobody's eyes, not  speaking for himself at all. Yet note that at the end of that very  same poem Hervey is back with humanity where he belongs:  Let us return:  There will be comfort in the meal tonight  In candle light,  And in the unsuspecting faces  'Round the tables at the childish games . . .  Peace, when the children's faces fall in sleep  Into prophetic masks of time-to-come,  When, like the night,  The silent answer of the darkness comes.  Come, let us weigh the anchor and go home.  In New Legends he has found his level. There is a great variety  of scene and of treatment here. I would like to conclude with  the valedictory poem in this volume, which is called The Rose in  Amber. It seems to me to have something that is really hauntingly  lovely and completely Hervey Allen.  This rose in amber bloomed when earth was young,  When man was not yet here, perhaps, or blind,  A thought of perfect beauty dwelt upon  Once by the natural mind.  So may our poems be in days to come  When all the winds that stir their leaves are dumb.  Ephemeral perfume they need not distill;  No one will care to ask what bees they drew,  In what dim summer of the soul they blew.  The rose will be in amber calm and clear.  22  *f*r^ 	asu06600000010031001							29822362 Bytes	3806	5617	3146036878	RGB	8	600	asu06600000010031001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/270	270	271.jp2	/asu0660/image/271.jp2

My Father					Longfellow, Alice M. (Alice Mary), 1850-1928																											asu0660000002	THE  CARRE LL  Volume I DECEMBER,   1960 Number 2  MY FATHER  By Alice M. Longfellow  MY FATHER CAME to Cambridge in the year 1837,  having prepared for the position of Professor of  Belles Lettres at Harvard College by eighteen  months of foreign travel and study. The old Craigie House at  once attracted him, and several months later he was fortunate  enough to secure two pleasant rooms on the second floor. Here  he established himself with his books, a few good engravings,  and his flute. His desk was by the frcftit window, looking across  the Charles River to the Brighton meadows and hills beyond.  This broad, sunny outlook became almost a part of his daily  life, and is woven into many of his poems. The old house, too,  gained a stronger and stronger hold on him with its associations  and memories. The staunch English Tory, Major John Vassall,  who had built it ample and strong to carry on the family traditions, and who doubtless thought it secure for a long posterity,  had been forced away by the revolutionary outbreak of the  Provinces. The vacant house was taken by the Provisional Government and used by General Washington whose presence there  was a familiar thought.  "Up and down these echoing stairs,  Heavy with the weight of cares,  Sounded his majestic tread;  Yes, within this very room  Sat he in those hours of gloom,  Weary both in heart and head." 	asu06600000020003001							64995020 Bytes	3840	5640	3594495677	RGB	8	600	asu06600000020003001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/278	278	279.jp2	/asu0660/image/279.jp2
My Father					Longfellow, Alice M. (Alice Mary), 1850-1928																											asu0660000002	My father's social and hospitable nature soon surrounded him  with a charmed circle of congenial friends: Charles Sumner,  Charles Folsom, and Charles Amory, the three whose names  were commemorated in the river Charles, George S. Hillard,  Professor Cornelius Conway Felton, Professor E. A. Sophocles.  Father's life naturally fell into regular channels, and flowed  steadily and happily on with his friends, his college work, his  writing, and occasional visits to Boston for recreation. In those  days the hourly stage was the only means of communication,  and he often preferred to walk. My father was always fond of  exercise in the open air. He was never given to athletics in any  form, but he never omitted daily walks, often composing much  of his poetry as he walked in the garden, or on the covered  piazzas. His step was light and elastic, even in old age, and his  carriage erect, standing always to his full height.  He was always careful of his dress, and personal appearance,  being considered rather a dandy in his youth. He never permitted  any falling off in this respect, being as punctilious and careful  in the home circle as in public, and expecting it of others.  Order and moderation ruled all the habits of his life. Every  thing he touched fell at once into method. His papers were  always carefully arranged, the bills neatly labelled and filed  away as soon as paid, and this was attended to at once. He could  not endure any loose ends, any unpaid bills or unanswered  letters, although the attention to these details often encroached  seriously on time he needed for thought and work.  Next to the order of his papers and letters, was that of his  books. His fondness for beauty showed itself in fine bindings  and handsome cases, in both of which he took very great delight.  Nor was it only the exterior. The quality of the paper, the type,  the width of margin, these were things for which he greatly cared  and his books were always handled as tenderly and lovingly as  children. Any careless handling or rough cutting was an unpardonable sin to him, and often in times of fatigue or perplexity  I think of him sitting quietly by the fireside in the twilight, finding rest and soothing in the regular, measured cutting of the  book on his knee.  After his marriage in 1843, the sunny study upstairs, with its  beautiful outlook, was given up to the children for a nursery,  and my father took a room on the same south-east corner down  .

But the children were not contented merely to take possession of his room, the pleasantest one in the house. They  wanted his presence also. A wonderful quiet and repose always  surrounded him. The heat and clamor of nursery broils departed  at his entrance, and with it came the feeling of security that he  could set all right. His mission was not to enforce, but to assist  goodness, and to make the rough places plain.  The study below was in constant danger of invasion, as his  much enduring patience and kindness of heart could never shut  the door. Sometimes the invasion was from within, from the  foes of his own household, for the attractions were manifold.  In the middle of the room was a large round table with a green  cloth, and beneath this, shelter and repose were often sought in  times of tribulation. There were tempting brass handles on the  old mahogany high-boy to rattle and interesting packets within  of envelopes, sealing wax, and quill pens. In one corner of the  book case was an old family Bible with marvellous pictures.  On an upper shelf, second only in attraction were the smallest  of all the books, French jokes, German student songs, and delightful Negro melodies. In one drawer was a never failing  supply of chocolate for times of hunger, and in another an  exciting picture story, the product of my father, who added  to it from time to time.  This assault from within was onlyiialf the battle, however.  There was also a constant assault from without. Strangers, both  native and foreign, all wanting something, sympathy, advice,  help, and too there were the curiosity seekers. Among the  visitors, of course there were many who came to bring pleasant  words of affection and interest, but many more who drew largely  on my father's time, patience and strength. He had a tender  feeling for all foreigners, especially for Italians. His love for  Italy was very strong, and the musical language at once brought  to him pictures of the sunny and lovely land, lakes and vineyards,  palaces and marbles. The land of Dante was in some ways more  familiar than his own, and for all the other exiles from this  charmed place he felt the truest sympathy. He never failed to  win a smile, with the flash of white teeth, and a hearty "Buon  giorno, signore" from every organ grinder. There was a constant  procession to the house, and many a cold, dark day was brightened for them by a short, pleasant talk in their own tongue, and 	asu06600000020005001							72859596 Bytes	4073	5961	3533704468	RGB	8	600	asu06600000020005001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/280	280	281.jp2	/asu0660/image/281.jp2
My Father					Longfellow, Alice M. (Alice Mary), 1850-1928																											asu0660000002	a few coins always folded in paper that they might be more  easily picked up.  In writing any sketch of my father I am conscious that there  will always be the feeling that but little has been said, and much  has been withheld. This perhaps follows of necessity when speaking of a character both simple and reserved, and with no moods  or contradictions. A healthy, simple, direct nature expresses itself  in daily living and being, and in its contact with every human  soul it meets. When to this simplicity of nature is added the  poetic gift, the perception of the underlying beauty and harmony  of life, then through his poetry and thought is the man himself  revealed. His personality can be found when sought for between  the lines of every poem, and in the acts of his daily life, telling  his own story of inward light and clearness of vision.  There were no hidden and unexplored regions in my father's  nature, only to be understood and rightly interpreted by later  revelations. Every thing in his life was free and open to the sun  and air, but in spite of perfect directness and simplicity, he was  a man of very deep reserve, even to his own family. A reserve  not caused by any self-absorption, or lack of interest in others,  but, on the contrary, caused by an extreme delicacy of feeling  that made it impossible for him to touch upon subjects very  close to himself or to run the risk of touching the inner life of  another in even the most tender manner . . .  My father's work was done almost imperceptibly to the household. There were no periods devoted exclusively to hard work,  followed by periods of entire recreation. His habits were of  steady, regular, quiet diligence. His life was rich and full, but  moderate and temperate in all things. In his youth he had keenly  enjoyed the delights of foreign life, but he was not by nature  fitted for travel, and for him the thought that to "stay at home  is best" fully expressed his desire.  Old age came to him gently, and although there were days  of weariness, there was no weakening of his powers. His step  was steady, the grasp of his hand firm, and the clear light in his  face and eyes showed the serenity of the soul within. 	asu06600000020006001							66378196 Bytes	3840	5760	27810250	RGB	8	600	asu06600000020006001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/281	281	282.jp2	/asu0660/image/282.jp2

The Integrity of Longfellow's Philosophic Perspective					Ward, Robert Stafford																											asu0660000002	THE INTEGRITY of LONGFELLOW'S  PHILOSOPHIC PERSPECTIVE  By Robert Stafford Ward  ALTHOUGH MOST WRITERS about Longfellow have  mentioned his sixty year period of poetic productivity,  and recognized the high level of his workmanship from  beginning to end, the persistent integrity of philosophic perspective evident in that work has escaped attention. Indeed, having  failed to perceive that perspective, many have missed the meaning of his poetry. It seems, therefore, worthwhile to bring his  philosophy into that perspective which his poems demonstrate.  For a limited treatment of this theme two poems have been  selected; one, The Two Rivers,1 representative of Longfellow's  final period, the other, A Psalm of Life,2 representative of his  first mature work.  The Two Rivers consists of a group of four sonnets. The first  stanza was originally intended to stand, alone, for it was  composed on February 29, 1876, and recorded in the Journal  by the laconic entry: "Wrote a sonnet, Midnight."* The second  stanza, written two days later, then bore the title Two Rivers  and hence, like the first, was intended to be an independent  sonnet. The third stanza came on M^rch 3rd, and the fourth  two days after that. It therefore appears that the poet conceived  of the integrated poem only after the first two stanzas had been  written as independent sonnets, that he gave the title, The Two  Rivers, to them both, and added the other two stanzas as an  amplification of the theme.  The evidence that independently written sonnets were combined into a closely integrated unit is taken from manuscripts  which the University of Miami Library is fortunate to have in  its outstanding de Valcourt Longfellow Collection. Without  examination of these manuscripts it seems unlikely that anyone  would suspect that the plan of the whole poem had not been  formed before the first line was written. On the evidence,  however, we must attribute the integration of The Two Rivers  not to any concatenation of events (such as the deaths of  Felton, Sumner and Agassiz, which suggested Three Friends of  Mine41 and gave that series of sonnets their unity) but rather to 	asu06600000020009001							63979016 Bytes	3781	5637	3741947543	RGB	8	600	asu06600000020009001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/284	284	285.jp2	/asu0660/image/285.jp2
The Integrity of Longfellow's Philosophic Perspective					Ward, Robert Stafford																											asu0660000002	the philosophic perspective of the author working itself out in  words, slowly and deliberately. It is this integration of perspective  which suggests that The Two Rivers may be taken as representative of Longfellow's attitude toward life during the final period.  The obvious choice for Longfellow's early views is A Psalm  of Life, written nearly forty years before and hardly to be  questioned as a sincere expression of the earlier perspective:  Tell me not, in mournful numbers,  Life is but an empty dream!—  For the soul is dead that slumbers,  And things are not what they seem.  Life is real! Life is earnest!  And the grave is not its goal;  Dust thou art, to dust returnest,  Was not spoken of the soul.  Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,  Is our destined end or way;  But to act, that each to-morrow  Find us farther than to-day.  Art is long, and Time is fleeting.  And our hearts, though stout and brave,  Still, like muffled drums, are beating  Funeral marches to the grave.  In the world's broad field of battle,  In the bivouac of Life,  Be not like dumb, driven cattle!  Be a hero in the strife!  Trust no Future, howe'er pleasant!  Let the dead Past bury its dead!  Act,—act in the living Present!  Heart within, and God overhead!  Lives of great men all remind us  We can make our lives sublime,  And, departing, leave behind us  Footprints on the sands of time;  Footprints, that perhaps another,  Sailing o'er life's solemn main,  A forlorn and shipwrecked brother.  Seeing, shall take heart again.  Let us, then, be up and doing,  With a heart for any fate;  Still achieving, still pursuing,  Learn to labor and to wait. 	asu06600000020010001							66929476 Bytes	3872	5760	1712249587	RGB	8	600	asu06600000020010001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/285	285	286.jp2	/asu0660/image/286.jp2
The Integrity of Longfellow's Philosophic Perspective					Ward, Robert Stafford																											asu0660000002	The Psalm's statement of the young Longfellow's philosophy  requires less search for allusions than its riper expression four  decades later. Let us then take that span in one stride and  examine its full flowering in the mind of the mature poet. The  four stanzas of The Two Rivers are inserted separately preceding  the pertinent commentary:  STANZA I  Slowly the hour-hand of the clock moves round;  So slowly that no human eye hath power  To see it move! Slowly in shine or shower  The painted ship above it, homeward bound,  Sails, but seems motionless, as if aground;  Yet both arrive at last; and in his tower  The slumberous watchman wakes and strikes  the hour,  A mellow, measured, melancholy sound.  Midnight! the outpost of advancing day!  The frontier town and citadel of night!  The watershed of Time, from which the streams  Of Yesterday and To-morrow take their way,  One to the land of promise and of light,  One to the land of darkness and of dreams!  The poem begins by comparing the hour-hand of a clock  with the painted ship above it. The similarity between them is  that their motion, though imperceptible to the human eye, is  constant. At midnight both reach their goals, and a "slumberous  watchman wakes and strikes the hour." Faith in progress is thus  the first assertion of this poem, even as it was the theme of A  Psalm of Life. In this connection it will be remembered that  Sumner, writing to Longfellow about the former's famous Phi  Beta Kappa Oration on the "Law of Progress," said that it  contained nothing not expressed in A Psalm of Life.5  Not so obvious, but none the less real, is the relationship m  thought of the line of the Psalm, "For the soul is dead that  slumbers" to those words of The Two Rivers: "The slumberous  watchman wakes." The watchman symbolizes the human soul,  the sleeping of which had long been considered by Longfellow  to be a kind of death, a view derived, in his Bowdoin days, from  the study of John Locke's great Essay on the question, "Does  the soul ever sleep?"6 In Footsteps of Angels, composed as early  as 1837, he had written of "voices of the Night" which "Wake  the better soul, that slumbered,"7 and the sonnet Sleep, written  April 7, 1875, refers to sleep as the "lesser mystery at the feast  whereof the greater mystery is death!"8  • 7 	asu06600000020011001							66378228 Bytes	3840	5760	2061091394	RGB	8	600	asu06600000020011001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/286	286	287.jp2	/asu0660/image/287.jp2
The Integrity of Longfellow's Philosophic Perspective					Ward, Robert Stafford																											asu0660000002	In a literary lecture delivered at Cambridge in May of 1838,  he said of the soul that it was fated "to die continually. No  sooner here on earth does it awake to its peculiar being, than it  struggles to behold and comprehend the Spirit of Life," becomes  "quick and creative like that spirit itself, and yet slumbers away  into death."9 This lecture manuscript was incorporated into that  of Hyperion, and there Paul Fleming paraphrased it as follows:  "as the body continually changes and takes unto itself new  properties ... the soul... is changed by acquiring new powers,  and thus may be said to die."10 It seems therefore that the waking  of the watchman in The Two Rivers symbolizes the creative  activity of the soul, the activity identified with poetry in the title  Voices of the Night.  It is significant that the sound made when the watchman strikes  the hour is called a "mellow, measured, melancholy sound,"  constituting an accurate description of most of Longfellow's  verse, which was sweet, metrical, and sad. For him, too, life was  that way—full of disciplined love and sorrow, devoid of unruly  hatred and anger. For him life was still a serious matter, no  "empty dream." Poetry, too, was for him, as to most Americans,  a serious responsibility, not mere entertainment or frivolous  display of virtuosity. It had a serious function, not merely to  charm, but "to strengthen and to teach."11  The first stanza goes oil to liken midnight to the arrival of the  outpost of day's advancing army at a "frontier town and citadel  of night!", a suggestion of struggle reminiscent of that stanza of  the Psalm which ends: "Be a hero in the strife." Midnight is  then called a "watershed of Time," from which the "past and  future flow." This image of the mountain had been used nearly  forty years before, in Hyperion: "Thus, then, stands Man;—a  mountain on the boundary between two worlds;—its foot in one,  its summit far-rising into the other. From this summit the  manifold landscape of life is visible, the way of the Past and  Perishable, which we have left behind us; and as we evermore  ascend, bright glimpses of the daybreak of Eternity beyond us!"12  Longfellow had early and often used the image of the river  of life, notably in the Prelude to Voices of the Night: "Look,  then, into thine heart, and write! Yes, into Life's deep stream!"13  Here, however, for the first time, Life is likened to two rivers,  one representing the past and the other the future.

The Integrity of Longfellow's Philosophic Perspective					Ward, Robert Stafford																											asu0660000002	toward the past, called a "land of darkness and of dreams!", is  similar to that of the Psalm, but the future, called "the land of  promise and of Light," shines brighter than in his earlier attitude:  "Trust no Future, howe'er pleasant."  STANZA II  O River of Yesterday, with current swift  Through chasms descending, and soon lost to  sight,  I do not care to follow in their flight  The faded leaves, that on thy bosom drift!  0 River of To-morrow, I uplift  Mine eyes, and thee I follow, as the night  Wanes into morning, and the dawning light  Broadens, and all the shadows fade and shift!  1 follow, follow, where thy waters run  Through unfrequented, unfamiliar fields,  Fragrant with flowers and musical with song;  Still follow, follow; sure to meet the sun,  And confident, that what the future yields  Will be the right, unless myself be wrong.  The poet's attitude toward these two rivers is amplified in the  second stanza. Beginning with an apostrophe to the "River of  Yesterday," he uses the image of a swift current descending into  chasms to indicate the past rapidly fading out of his consciousness; for he prefers not to watch the "faded leaves, that on thy  bosom drift!" This desire not to dwell in memories is a restatement of the Psalm's "Let the dead past bury its dead."  There follows an apostrophe to the "River of Tomorrow"  asserting that he gives his thoughts to the future, painted in a  most optimistic vein, fuii of "dawning light" in which "all the  shadows fade and shift." While different from the early poem's  "Act in the living present," this attitude is not inconsistent with  the former, but rather a shift in emphasis, in the direction of  greater optimistic faith in progress. The River of Tomorrow is  described as running "through unfrequented, unfamiliar fields,"  and in this respect reaffirms the Psalm in the soul's need for  change. But the ensuing description of the River of Tomorrow  as flowing through banks "Fragrant with flowers and musical  with song" is again evidence of a growing optimism, for the  Psalm did not mention pleasures or poems or any other future  satisfaction; rather in it, labor carried its own satisfaction. 	asu06600000020013001							69036436 Bytes	3952	5821	1103163468	RGB	8	600	asu06600000020013001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/288	288	289.jp2	/asu0660/image/289.jp2
The Integrity of Longfellow's Philosophic Perspective					Ward, Robert Stafford																											asu0660000002	t  The stanza concludes with an expression of supreme faith in  the certainty of meeting "the sun, and confident that what the  future yields will be the right, unless myself be wrong." Again  this is not inconsistent with the Psalm in which God was o'erhead  and only heart within; for here, too, there is no predictability as  to what the future will yield, only faith in its Tightness for those  who act rightly. The optimism evidenced here is further apparent  in the last lines from his pen, the posthumous poem The Bells  of San Bias,14 which concludes: "The world rolls into light; It  is daylight everywhere."  STANZA III  Yet not in vain, O River of Yesterday,  Through chasms of darkness to the deep descending,  I heard thee sobbing in the rain, and blending  Thy voice with other voices far away.  I called to thee, and yet thou wouldst not stay,  But turbulent, and with thyself contending,  And torrent-like thy force on pebbles spending,  Thou wouldst not listen to a poet's lay.  Thoughts, like a loud and sudden rush of wings,  Regrets and recollections of things past,  With hints and prophecies of things to be,  And inspirations, which, could they be things,  And stay with us, and we could hold them fast,  Were our good angels,—these I owe to thee.  The third stanza, completely concerned with the past, commences with the assertion that it was not lived in vain, the  reference becoming autobiographical as the river is described as  "sobbing in the rain." One thinks at once of the tragic deaths of  Mary Potter Longfellow and Frances Appleton Longfellow. The  river is said to blend its "voice with other voices far away," a  line reminiscent of Footsteps of Angels,15 written in 1839 and  concerned with communion with the dead. At that time such  communion seemed to him a relief from present care, a fact  referred to in this third stanza: "I called to thee . . .". But it  goes on to record this attempt to stop the flow of events as 1  unavailing ". . . yet thou wouldst not stay."  It is significant with regard to Longfellow's poetic experience  that he used the words, "torrent-like thy force on pebbles spending." Turbulence, stress, and anguish were not, in him, productive of poetry and were therefore futile. Having disposed of  the negative aspect of the past in the first two quatrains of the  third stanza, he devoted the sestet to an enumeration of its  • 10 	asu06600000020014001							67449384 Bytes	3902	5760	3145100055	RGB	8	600	asu06600000020014001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/289	289	290.jp2	/asu0660/image/290.jp2
The Integrity of Longfellow's Philosophic Perspective					Ward, Robert Stafford																											asu0660000002	positive aspect, its contributions to the future. These turn out  to be: "Thoughts, like a loud and sudden rush of wings,"  suggesting Birds of Passage,16 written in 1845. He here values  the past primarily for giving him inspiration for poems. The  attitude is typical of his complete and lifelong devotion to a  poetic career and seems slightly shocking until one recollects  the lofty function which he assigned to poetry.  "Regrets and recollections of things past" are here valued  only if they carry with them "hints and prophecies of things to  be, and inspirations," lines asserting the same theory of poetic  inspiration proffered in a poem written more than thirty years  before. In Seaweed Longfellow had written of the materials of  poetry as the fruits of past experience, truths gained "In the  tropic clime of Youth" from the struggle with fate and from the  wreck of shattered hopes.17 Of the inspirations he says that,  if they could be realized, they would be "our good angels," a  thought he frequently expressed, notably in the twin poems  Prometheus and Epimetheus,ls of the inability of the poet to put  into words the complete poem he has envisioned.  STANZA IV  And thou, O River of To-morrow, flowing  Between thy narrow adamantine walls,  But beautiful, and white with waterfalls,  And wreaths of mist, like hands the pathway  showing; •  I hear the trumpets of the morning blowing,  I hear thy mighty voice, that calls and calls,  And see, as Ossian saw in Morven's halls,  Mysterious phantoms, coming, beckoning, going!  It is the mystery of the unknown  That fascinates us; we are children still,  Wayward and wistful; with one hand we cling  To the familiar things we call our own,  And with the other, resolute of will,  Grope in the dark for what the day will bring.  The fourth and final stanza is devoted to the River of Tomorrow as its predecessor had been to the River of Yesterday.  It is described as flowing through "narrow adamantine walls."  And this is consistent with A Psalm of Life, for there too is a  belief in fate, "our destined end or way." A belief in divine providence was persistent with him; it was the cornerstone of his  belief in progress. With his friend Agassiz he could see in  evolution evidence of design. It is noteworthy in this respect that  • 11 	asu06600000020015001							64198244 Bytes	3792	5640	3160681685	RGB	8	600	asu06600000020015001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/290	290	291.jp2	/asu0660/image/291.jp2
The Integrity of Longfellow's Philosophic Perspective					Ward, Robert Stafford																											asu0660000002	f  !  in The Masque of Pandora he introduced a Chorus of the Fates  and Prometheus arguing against the Immortal Gods: "Powerful  ye are, But not omnipotent. Ye cannot fight Against Necessity.  The Fates control you, As they do us, and so far we are equals!"19  Over the River rise "wreaths of mist, like hands the pathway  showing." This image was first used by him fifty years before in  a Song published in the United States Literary Gazette for April  1, 1826. In it he says of a river:  The silver mist, that breaks  From out that woodland cover,  Betray the hidden path it takes,  And hangs the current over! 20  i  1  Here again the thought is consistent with that of the Psalm in  which the future, though destined, is unknowable; but here there  is the added view that we do have vague and misty indications  of the path life will take. In the second quatrain of the final  stanza he speaks of hearing the voice of the future, a "mighty  voice that calls and calls." The line suggests and serves to explicate a similar line in The Tide Rises, The Tide Falls, written  three years later. The original reading: "But the sea in the  darkness calls and calls," was later altered to read "But the sea,  the sea in darkness calls."21 Although here symbolized by the  dawning light and there by the sea, in both cases the voice is  that of the ultimate future and its attraction is persistent in both.  The Two Rivers ends by asserting the fascination which "the  mystery of the unknown" has for us. The poet feels that we are  like children clinging "with one hand ... to the familiar things  we call our own," the other resolutely groping "in the dark for  what the day will bring." Qne feels that The River of Tomorrow,  in the poet's mind, flows not only to death but beyond, just as in  A Psalm of Life. "The grave is not its goal." It is significant that  no distinction is made between the future which precedes death  and that which follows. Neither was subject to foreknowledge in  Longfellow's view; all he had was adamantine faith in its being j  an amelioration of what had already passed. He had previously  expressed the same view in To-Morrow, written on February  17, 1866. There he spoke of To-morrow as "the mysterious,  unknown guest" and denied any fear of it because of faith in  divine providence.22  • 12  \  \ 	asu06600000020016001							66190164 Bytes	3894	5664	2662740527	RGB	8	600	asu06600000020016001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/291	291	292.jp2	/asu0660/image/292.jp2
The Integrity of Longfellow's Philosophic Perspective					Ward, Robert Stafford																											asu0660000002	I  From this examination of the two poems, it seems apparent  that Longfellow persisted from 1838 to his death in 1882 in  adherence to the philosophy of progress. Within that framework  he retained throughout those years a belief that constant, active  change is essential to the life of the soul. He further adhered  to a feeling that intellectual progress involves eternal struggle,  even beyond death. In his poetry he continued to use the image  of man elevated on a mountain whence he could look both to the  past and to the future. And he still felt that it was better not to  look into the past. Moreover he retained a belief that the future  was predetermined in divine providence, although he asserted  the impossibility of man's sharing that prevision. Finally, he  continued to believe that it was the function of poetry to record  the progressive unfolding of that providence.  The only changes in attitude revealed are not inconsistent with  his former views but developments out of them. First, the earlier  emphasis upon turbulent struggle has yielded to a desire for more  disciplined, harmonious power. There has been a shift in emphasis from the present to the future with a tremendous increase  of optimistic faith in the latter. And the past gained in positive  value since, although not to be lived in, it yielded poetic experience in the form of insights into the future — valuable truth,  though difficult for poets to put into artistic form and impossible  for complete expression; yet fascinating for their very uncertainty  and mystery.

José Toribio Medina					Selle, Mildred H.																											asu0660000002	!  JOSE TOR1BIO MEDINA  By Mildred H. Selle  A SCHOLAR working in the field of Latin American history  and culture will of necessity find himself drawn to the  Lworks by Jose Toribio Medina. A sizeable collection  of his materials is available in the University of Miami Library.  Although dedicated above all else to the history of Chile, and  particularly to the history of Spanish colonial rule, Medina wrote  in such a wide variety of subjects that one is impelled to recognize his importance in all areas of Latin American studies. So  highly is he regarded among scholars of the history of the Western  Hemisphere that it has been said that "it would be impossible to  take a step in American history without resorting to the publications of Senor Medina."1  Medina was born in Santiago de Chile in 1852 and lived  seventy-seven productive years. The son of a lawyer, he pleased  his father by preparing himself for the same career after receiving the degree of bachelor in philosophy and the humanities at  the age of sixteen. Law did not, however, appeal to Medina as  much as did history, and although he rapidly became a judge,  and also served as a diplomatic secretary, the greater part of his  life he devoted to research and publishing in the fields of history  and bibliography.  Medina reached maturity at a time when great historians had  been lately developed in Chile. Their influence, together with  that of numerous friends and acquaintances of a history-loving,  book-loving turn of mind, opened up to the young Jose Toribio  the challenging view of a lifetime of gathering and organizing  the hitherto unknown documents, papers, acts, and relations that  became the very backbone of his extensive writing, and earned  for him the title of "greatest bibliographer in Christendom."  One of the renowned older historians of Chile, Benjamin  Vicuna Mackenna, pleased and impressed by the work Medina  had achieved in his Los Aborijenes de Chile (Medina at this  time was only thirty years old), praised him highly, saying that  the bibliographer-historian "had broken with the traditions and  methods upheld by Prescott, Jefferson, and Humboldt. Instead  he subjected every detail upon which he touched to an untiring,  searching, investigation, whether it involved a matter of language,  bones, customs, creeds, or pottery."2  • 14 	asu06600000020018001							66177652 Bytes	3868	5701	304794677	RGB	8	600	asu06600000020018001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/293	293	294.jp2	/asu0660/image/294.jp2
José Toribio Medina					Selle, Mildred H.																											asu0660000002	Of the vast number of publications that constitute the total  contribution this prolific writer has made to history and bibliography— some 350 separate works written, translated, or edited by Medina were exhibited in connection with the centennial  celebration of his birth in 1952—the great majority were produced in very limited editions on Medina's own press. An edition  of 200 copies, a commonplace in the publishing of Medina's  works, of which an edition of only 100 copies was not unusual,  can barely supply enough copies for even the specialized libraries  of universities and learned societies. The University of Miami  Library therefore feels itself fortunate in being able to offer the  scholar the relatively large number of Medina titles it presently  owns, and will, whenever possible, add further items in all of  the many subject fields in which Medina wrote.  Of fairly few writers can it be said that a subject classification  of their works presented a problem. Yet many attempts to classify  Medina's history, bibliographies, and other works have resulted  in altogether inadequate groupings. A detailed but very useful  listing is that of Medina's secretary and friend, Guillermo Feliu  Cruz, whose list of nineteen categories is, in somewhat condensed  and abbreviated form, the following: literary criticism; natural  history; translations; collective and individual biographies; folklore; cultural, literary, geographic, and social history, and historical criticism; geography and cartography; ethnology, anthropology, and ethnography; voyages; documentary compilations;  literary compilations; paleography; American numismatics; aboriginal American languages; academic discourses; lexicography;  collected essays; autobiography; and a final group of subjects,  larger by far than any of the others, namely bibliography and  the history of printing in America and Oceania. Works in very  nearly all of these categories are available in the University of  Miami Library. In the history of printing, for example, we find  La Imprenta en Caracas and similar works concerning the press  in Bogota, in Cartagena, in Oaxaca, in Habana, in Merida de  Yucatan, in Lima, in Guadalajara, and in Arequipa ... as well  as the impressive eight volume La Imprenta en Mexico.  In social history we find Cosas de la-Colonia, and the histories  of the Inquisition: Historia del Tribunal del Santo Oficio de la  Inquisicion de Lima, 1569-1820, and its counterpart for Chile,  for Mexico, and for Cartagena, and La Primitiva Inquisicion  • 15 	asu06600000020019001							65238028 Bytes	3774	5760	166566599	RGB	8	600	asu06600000020019001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/294	294	295.jp2	/asu0660/image/295.jp2
José Toribio Medina					Selle, Mildred H.																											asu0660000002	Americana 1493-1569.  Bibliographies include his Ensayo Acerca de Una Mapoteca  Chilena ... in which he lists over 2300 maps and plans, Diccich  nario de Anonimos y Seudonimos Hispanoamericanos, a work  which brought Medina criticism from a rival bibliographer for  its failure to list all anonymous and pseudonymous authors, which  criticism Medina ignored, and the splendid seven volume Bib-  lioteca Hispano-Americana 1493-1810, and several others.  Still another category of writings basic to the comprehensive  history of Chile that was Medina's lifelong goal includes the  various works on coins and medals that Feliii Cruz identifies  as American numismatics: Medallas Coloniales Hispano-Americanos, Las Medallas Chilenas, and Las Monedas Coloniales  Hispano-Americanas are all among the University of Miami's  holdings. The last named work is typical of the entire group of  works on numismatics: together with the biography of engravers  employed by the Latin American mints it includes a minute  description of many of the coins included in the listing. Chile-  nismos, Apuntes Lexicogrdficos, is the only title among the  several identified by Feliu Cruz as "lexicography" that Miami  presently owns. Interestingly, this Library's extraordinary collection of editions of Longfellow's Evangeline does not include  the prose translation that was Medina's first published book,  brought out in an edition of 1000 copies when the translator  was twenty-two years old, and in a second edition twenty-five  years later.  This account does not attempt to mention titles of books other  than those for whose authorship Medina is given credit. Translations (other than of Evangeline) and articles that appeared in  periodicals, whether in Latin America or in the United States,  are not mentioned, although the Library has extensive holdings  in Latin American periodicals of Medina's period. These, together with works about Medina, are readily available to any  interested student.  References  1.

Uses of the New Russian Collection					Dorosh, John T. (John Thomas), b. 1894																											asu0660000002	USES OF THE NEW  RUSSIAN COLLECTION  By John Thomas Dorosh  THE RECENT ACQUISITION of a Russian collection  of over 150,000 publications, including books, pamphlets and issues of periodicals, is an act of faith, both  on the part of the Library and of its University. Why, if not  impelled by faith, should the University of Miami Library collect  Russian material when it is so far distant from any center where  this resource is in great demand?  Justification for the Russian project may perhaps lie in the  experience of The Library of Congress. A similar challenge was  raised when that institution first began its Slavic Collection. Yet  today that Collection has become the basis of practically all studies and research projects in the Slavic field in this country.  Foreign publications represent a considerable body of material  in the collections of most large university libraries today, being  essential for advanced studies and special research projects in all  aspects of world affairs, especially those concerning the Soviet  Union. A generation ago the English-speaking scientist could  afford to ignore Russian scientific publications; today he has to  keep abreast of them as he does of tliose published in his own  language. Even before the launching of the sputniks, the American scientist was aware of the importance of Russian scientific  periodicals. Today the Russian language has become one of the  important vehicles for scientific and technical reporting.  The United States Office of Education reports that today there  are not less than 400 institutions of higher learning, some high  schools, and even some lower grade schools, which have introduced the Russian language into their curriculum. If this trend  persists, and there are many indications that it will, in the next  decade there will be a considerable number of young American  scientists who will have sufficient knowledge of the language to be  able to use the most significant papers in their fields of specialization. Libraries will have to be prepared to support these scientists. When that time arrives, many people will be grateful that  the University of Miami Library had the courage and the  foresight to acquire the Russian collection when it did.  • 17 	asu06600000020021001							64995944 Bytes	3840	5640	3769519764	RGB	8	600	asu06600000020021001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/296	296	297.jp2	/asu0660/image/297.jp2
Uses of the New Russian Collection					Dorosh, John T. (John Thomas), b. 1894																											asu0660000002	What does this Russian collection represent? Does it have  sufficient material to meet only the current needs of the University, which are limited, or is it sufficiently comprehensive to meet  the future needs of a larger scope? How does this collection  compare with similar collections in other university libraries?  It is too early to venture any comparison. Other university  libraries, such as Harvard, Yale, Columbia, and the University of  California, have been collecting Slavic materials for many  years and they do have substantial Russian collections. The  University of Miami Library is only a newcomer in this field. Its  program is not quite two years old. The preliminary examination  of this collection has revealed, however, that it has an excellent  selection of the publications in most fields issued in the Soviet  Union since 1947. Though the publication of prior imprint are  represented in considerable bulk, a systematic filling of gaps will  be needed to make them effective. Yet there should be no apprehension regarding the scope of this collection, as it is a well known  fact that the most important publications in the Soviet Union,  especially in the fields of science and technology, were issued  after World War II. It can be safely stated that this collection  will compare favorably with similar collections in any American  university library for the period it covers.  In order to evaluate the collection it had to be arranged in  some sort of order. Since tiie Library of the University of Miami  recently adopted the Library of Congress classification system it  was a comparatively easy task to arrange the monographs and  pamphlets by class symbols according to this system. Regular  periodicals were arranged alphabetically by titles and other  serials by cities and issuing bodies. This arrangement has made  it possible not only for appraisal but also the servicing of the  whole collection. Several members of the faculty and students,  some with a knowledge of Russian, have examined their particular fields in this collection and the consensus is that it contains  sufficient material to meet their needs.  In appraising the collection only those items which are especially important and have current interest will be mentioned.  The general class includes only a few substantial works, such  as the Great Soviet Encyclopedia in a few scattered volumes and  its supplements for 1957-58. A complete set of this work, however, is available in the Library's Reference Department. This is  • 18 	asu06600000020022001							64304876 Bytes	3720	5760	3561777977	RGB	8	600	asu06600000020022001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/297	297	298.jp2	/asu0660/image/298.jp2
Uses of the New Russian Collection					Dorosh, John T. (John Thomas), b. 1894																											asu0660000002	the most comprehensive work on the Soviet Union available in this  country today. Its articles on most subjects are accompanied by  bibliographical data sufficient for ground work in any kind of  research or study on the Soviet Union.  Histories of the Academies of the USSR and other Republics,  as well as histories of the Soviet Archives, are well represented.  This class also includes an almost complete set of works by  Alexander Hertzen, one of the early fathers of communism.  The number of works on philosophy is impressive. In addition  to many Soviet publications dealing with Marxist philosophy,  this class has a good number of substantial works translated  from German and French philosophers. The works in the field  of religion are predominately of anti-religious character based  on science as a weapon to combat religion, though there are a  few good works, not of Soviet origin, dealing with theological  subjects and histories of church and religion.  The history class proved to be considerably better than  expected. In addition to many scholarly works in the general  histories and histories of individual countries in the original and  in translation, this class is well represented by Sovet historiography, many primary sources dealing with the revolutions of  1905 and 1907, and World War II, and substantial works on  foreign relations. There is a considerable number of history  text-books on the university level and lower.  Materials on geography, anthropology and ethnography are  quite numerous and, supported by such scholarly journals as the  Problems of Geography, Soviet Ethnography and several others,  give a good foundation for any kind of study in these fields. This  class is particularly rich in publications on the physical geography of the Soviet Union in general and physical descriptions  of the various regions of the USSR. Oceanography, folklore,  manners and customs, sports and amusements, and especially  Soviet sports, have a very good representation.  The social sciences class, which is quite large, has such  valuable items as Statistical Yearbooks for 1956-1958 for the  'USSR and the RSFSR. It should be mentioned that no statistical  data was issued for export between 1939 and 1956. The works  on the Soviet economics, particularly on Soviet economic plans  and collective farms, are so well represented that this collection  needs only a few of the basic works to make it sufficiently ade-  • 19 	asu06600000020023001							73417380 Bytes	3980	6147	1563621318	RGB	8	600	asu06600000020023001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/298	298	299.jp2	/asu0660/image/299.jp2
Uses of the New Russian Collection					Dorosh, John T. (John Thomas), b. 1894																											asu0660000002	quate for any kind of serious study in these fields. Publications  on finance, labor, trade, industry and communications are as  good as we could expect to find in any American library collection of this size. Economic studies of practically all satellite  countries appear in many substantial works. Of course, works  dealing with the party and the youth organization and their  activities comprise a good portion of this class.  Political sciences, especially dealing with other countries,  seem to be a favorite field with many Soviet writers. The pamphlet series published by the All-Union Society for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge, of which there  are at least 6,000 copies in the collection, deals with various  subjects including political and social life in the United States.  Such titles as "American Aggression," "American Colonialism'"  and many others of similar ilk, give a grossly distorted picture  of American social and political life. This class also contains  some very important and useful works for studies of the Soviet  Union, such as the Administrative and Territorial Divisions of the  USSR and the RSFSR, which among other information includes  reference to all geographical names that have been changed; the  Constitution of the USSR and of all the Republics; Diplomatic  History, and other works on Soviet Government; international  laws and some stenographic reports of the Party Congresses.  In the class of linguistics, literature, and theatre, about one  third of material in the original and translations represents other  countries on these subjects. Contemporary Soviet literature is  sufficiently comprehensive to meet any present needs of the  Russian class of the University. Old Russian classics are represented in complete editions of work of Lomonosov, Lermontov,  Nekrasov and Pushkin. For other well-known writers only  isolated volumes are available. Mention should be made of  several outstanding works on the methodology of teaching  Russian and a number of textbooks used in the Soviet schools,  including the grammar issued by the Academy of Sciences.  Soviet science is sufficiently covered. Mathematics, astronomy,  geology, chemistry and physics are represented by works of  many well-known authorities in these fields. Nuclear physics  especially should be mentioned for some outstanding works in  this particular field. Natural sciences, zoology and physiology  however, have some wide gaps which will need filling.  • 20 	asu06600000020024001							64638668 Bytes	3780	5698	1032930862	RGB	8	600	asu06600000020024001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/299	299	300.jp2	/asu0660/image/300.jp2

Uses of the New Russian Collection					Dorosh, John T. (John Thomas), b. 1894																											asu0660000002	Technology comprises approximately one-third of the whole  collection and seems to be as complete as one could possibly  find in any American university library. Engineering, machine-  building, railroads, communications, and power stations occupy  the largest portion of this class, though works on sputniks and  the application of atomic power to peaceful uses are far from  being neglected. Technology in the Soviet Union is a rapidly  expanding field and it should be borne in mind that many works  published two  years ago are almost outdated today.  Bibliographies, which are important reference tools and the  basis upon which any collection rests, are represented by such  essential items as Ezhegodnik Knigi (Annual of Soviet Books)  for 1956 (1957, 1958),which list all monographs published in  the Soviet Union for these years, and Knizhnaia letopis (Book  Chronicle); the National bibligraphy of which there is an incomplete set beginning with 1956. Current bibliographies on  practically every subject in the field of knowledge especially on  science and technology, including the Academy of Sciences'  important series of bio-bibliographies, are available in sufficient  number to help undergraduates and even post-graduate students  and scholars to find material on subjects of their special interest.  Approximately 200 dictionaries and encyclopedias in various  fields were segregated in the process of organizing the collection.  In summation, the University of Miami Library's Russian  materials in the present stage constitute considerably more than  a beginner's collection. In the opinion of the appraiser this  collection contains a sufficient number of important monographs,  pamphlets and periodicals to support most of the objectives of  the University for the teaching of the Russian language, for area  studies and for scholarly pursuits in the Soviet field.  A systematic program for acquiring retrospective basic works  and materials to fill in the gaps in some classes will be undertaken  by the University library on completion of the organization of  the Russian material. A recommended list will be prepared by  the writer, the consultant for the organization of the collection.  Every effort will be made to obtain as many as possible of the  needed items, which when added to the collection, together with  new items, as they become available, will no doubt make this a  completely satisfactory collection for the Soviet period.  21 	asu06600000020027001							65946584 Bytes	3815	5760	2881309661	RGB	8	600	asu06600000020027001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/302	302	303.jp2	/asu0660/image/303.jp2

Contributors to This Issue																																asu0660000002	CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS ISSUE  Alice M. Longfellow wrote this Victorian version of "Life  with Father" shortly before the death of Henry Wadsworth  Longfellow in 1882. Miss Longfellow outlived her father by  46 years. Her fond portrait of the poet as a family man is printed  here for the first time through the courtesy of Thomas de Val-  court, Librarian of Longfellow House.  Robert Stafford Ward, Professor of English at the University  of Miami, received a New England education and has reciprocated by a concentration on the literature of that area. He took  his undergraduate work at Yale, and both his Master's and  Doctorate degrees at Boston University. During one period of  divergence from literature he was graduated in law at Harvard.  He has contributed to SAMLA and the South Atlantic Studies  for Sturgis E. Leavitt.  John Thomas Dorosh served from 1943 to 1959 as Curator  of the Slavic Room of The Library of Congress. He is a Diplo-  mate of the Russian Orthodox Seminary. His service as consultant in the organization of Russian literature in the University  of Miami Library will be resumed after a leave of absence.  Mildred H. Selle, Assistant Acquisitions Librarian, with this  issue joins the editorial board of The Carrell.  Richard L. Merrick, Associate Professor of Art, chose the  Lemon City Library as the subject of his wood engraving on the  cover of this issue of The Carrell. The building dates from 1902,  eight years after establishment of the library by citizens of  Lemon City, now incorporated into Miami. The Coconut Grove  Library, depicted by Mr. Merrick in the first issue of The  Carrell, preceded the Lemon City structure. Antiquarians—if  the word is proper to so recent a period—advance claims of  library priority for each early village. The Carrell is content to  rest on Mr. Merrick's pictorial testimony that the founding  fathers valued books.

Aspects of E.G.O. (Eugene Gladstone O'Neill)					Wylie, Max, 1904-																											asu0660000003	THE  CARRE LL  Volume II JUNE,   1961 Number 1  ASPECTS OF E. G. O.  (Eugene Gladstone O'Neill)  a spicer-simson lecture  By Max Wylie  NOT MUCH that is dependable has been written about  Eugene O'Neill. It is as baffling as it is regrettable  that those men (and a few women) who were very  much on the scene when the O'Neill "legend" was beginning to  form and who are still with us, have written so little about it.  There does not exist, for example, such a thing as a coherent  monograph on O'Neill, written by one of his contemporaries or  co-workers. As the years pass, death diminishes the company.  Of those still about, the most valuable study of O'Neill would  come from the mind (and wise humors) of Kenneth MacGowan.  Harold McGhee could have written some useful chapters, but  they died in talk. McGhee was stage manager for All God's  Chillun when the show was raided by police, made a courageous  curtain speech, defied the police, and jumped into one of the  roles. He "bummed around" with O'Neill at night when work was  over, and according to O'Neill's spotty (and nearly useless) diary,  all these excursions were "disasters."  They weren't disasters to McGhee. He could drink and forget  it. At the Players he would talk of O'Neill by the hour. But  Note: This text is a redaction of Mr. Wylie's lecture and not originally prepared  for written presentation.

Aspects of E.G.O. (Eugene Gladstone O'Neill)					Wylie, Max, 1904-																											asu0660000003	McGhee was a director, not a writer. Beyond a brilliant blur of  anecdote (many of which I kept) he left nothing in the record.  A heart attack took him out three years ago.  Saxe Commins, who knew O'Neill best and longest; who was  his friend and editor (and dentist, at first) from 1915 until 1930  (most of Eugene O'Neill's old contacts were cut off after his  marriage to Carlotta Monterey) was in perfect position to put  together the definitive story, for Saxe knew it best. But he never  wrote it. The O'Neill papers that he accumulated will some day  be of great value.  In some ways (for example, in the way of their emotional  reaction to the assignment, or the challenge) Saxe Commins'  response to the work before him was much like that of Agnes  Boulton O'Neill Kaufman: neither wanted to touch it. It was  too much. It was too old, too personal, too tender, too painful.  Too much living had gone by and too many new problems—and  new joys—had obtruded.  I succeeded with Agnes. In 1958 she completed "Part of a  Long Story." But I failed with Saxe. He died a year ago, his work  on O'Neill just beginning.  The most sophisticated and urbane of all those men in the  early days was (and is) Kenneth MacGowan, whose books on  the theatre are in nearly every library in the world. This versatile  man has had (and is still having) interesting successes in many  fields—theatre, movies, editing, lecturing, research. He is currently in Greece on a Guggenheim Fellowship. In every sense he  is the true cosmopolitan that O'Neill himself was secretly so  anxious to be, and that he so secretly envied.  Socially and intellectually secure, Kenneth MacGowan started  out correctly at birth (Massachusetts), went to Harvard, graduated, became drama critic for the Boston Transcript, married,  begat children, became Sam Goldwyn's publicity director, then  drama critic for the New York Globe, a job he held for the four  years from 1919-1923. MacGowan's own books began to appear  about the same time Eugene O'Neill's "downtown" plays were  first seen, and of course the men became acquainted.  Today Kenneth MacGowan is Professor of Theatre Arts and  chairman of that division at the University of California. He is a  man of many curiosities and enthusiasms, taking Eugene O'Neill 	asu06600000030004001							66378436 Bytes	3879	5702	1481243791	RGB	8	600	asu06600000030004001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/312	312	313.jp2	/asu0660/image/313.jp2

O'Neill tried a good many different things too, as MacGowan  did, but O'Neill failed at them all—all but the big one. He had a  crack at Princeton. It didn't last a year. He had a term at the  "47 Workshop" before it moved down to Yale. He was unable  to finish a prose piece for Vanity Fair. He tried to write poetry.  All of it is puerile; almost comically wretched.  George Jean Nathan has stated somewhere that O'Neill once  wrote a scene for a play that was so unbearably funny it could  not be produced. I do not believe that statement, not because of  the man who made it but because of the nature of the man about  whom it was said; the unlikelihood of O'Neill's capacity to deliver  such. I know the plays well. And I have seen a quantity of the  "undiscovered" manuscripts. Except for one try at farce comedy  (1916) it is hard to remember anything in any O'Neill play that  is funny. In the man himself there was no fun at all, or next to  none. Certainly in his life there was nothing funny.  The matter of Eugene O'Neill's suicide attempt comes to mind.  There was nothing funny about that, nor about the spiritual desolation that brought him to a depression so destructive. But there  were two points about it that, to me, are of unusual interest. One  is that he told the whole story to Kenneth MacGowan and not to  Saxe Commins. Was that because of backgrounds? . . . O'Neill  admiring MacGowan's New England heritage, while holding that  of Commins in somewhat the same contempt as he held his own?  The other is that he told it as great big gaunt gruesome comedy.  Everything about Eugene O'Neill came out wretchedly, including his reaction to his own successes. Princeton had been a flop  (expelled). Love, marriage, fatherhood, had meant nothing  (never did.) He had abandoned, in 1909, his first wife (Kathleen  Jenkins) soon after he discovered she was pregnant. He never  saw or inquired of her again. Nor saw their son until he was 12.  Eugene O'Neill, at twenty-one, ran off to Honduras (on his  father's money) with a gold prospector and part-time fiddle  instructor named Stevens. There are two unusual letters extant on  this abortive excursion, unusual because they contain samples of  • 3 	asu06600000030005001							65704564 Bytes	3859	5672	2985774715	RGB	8	600	asu06600000030005001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/313	313	314.jp2	/asu0660/image/314.jp2

In this case, it was an appeal for  Bull Durham tobacco and magazines. After Honduras he  bummed around the world as an ordinary seaman, sponging off  his father. But sure signs of the writer are in those letters.  During this period he was captious, crapulous, backbiting,  unkempt, and indistinguishable in speech, action, and appetite  from the hairy apes to whose lost hopes and folkways he was so  soon to bring such lively (and deadly) animation.  He was an alcoholic who did not know it and although this is  not immaterial, it is incidental to the real turbulence: he was an  artist who did not know it and upon whose bleak but thirsting  consciousness the field of his own labors had not yet revealed  itself. And his suicide attempt, which nearly succeeded, was  instrumental in helping him find his way to playwriting.  The long voyages home, from Durban, from Buenos Aires,  Cobh, Liverpool, brought him to the colorless stand-up bar of  Jimmy the Priest's. After a brief moment of exhilaration, drink  always made this man more gloomy, more in-looking and pessimistic. On one of these occasions he was notified that his wife,  whom he had abandoned so early and so eagerly, wanted to be  free of a marriage that had never been more than a mockery and  a gross inconvenience.  Eugene O'Neill decided to provide the evidence necessary for  annulment. It was not hard. He picked up two prostitutes and two  bottles of Bourbon and checked in at a Raine's Law hotel. In this  company and in this condition, he permitted himself to be "seen"  the next morning and thus to permit his marriage to break up  and his wife to be free.  But Eugene O'Neill was sickened by what he saw, sickened of  self and of living. He went back to the saloon, this time with a  bottle of Veronal tablets, and began to drink again. When his  nerve came up, he swallowed enough pills to kill him.  But he made one mistake: he told his bar cronies what he had  done. Two of them immediately took Eugene out into the cold of  West Street (it was February), their simple but useful knowledge  bent on one thing only: keep the man walking and awake. And  this they did, splashing ice-cold slush over his neck and face  any time the drug threatened to win the race. 	asu06600000030006001							67757248 Bytes	3949	5716	1780499101	RGB	8	600	asu06600000030006001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/314	314	315.jp2	/asu0660/image/315.jp2
Aspects of E.G.O. (Eugene Gladstone O'Neill)					Wylie, Max, 1904-																											asu0660000003	They were gone for several hours but they brought back  O'Neill, on his own feet, exhausted and covered with filth, but  safely past the crisis.  There was a celebration going on. Others, who knew O'Neill,  had telegraphed his famous father James (working at a theatre  only a few blocks north on 23rd Street) for fifty dollars to hospitalize Eugene. The money had come, they had cashed the  voucher, and were "drinking it up" when their friend was lugged  back in. He was put to bed right away, and in the same room and  the same sheets in which a long-term boarder—a consumptive—  had earlier expired the same day. No change of linen.  If Eugene O'Neill really had tuberculosis, it is probable that  this was the exposure that gave it to him. When he could get up  again, he went out to his family's house in New London, (the  setting for Long Day's Journey Into Night). Doctors thought he  had contracted tuberculosis and he was sent for five months to  the Gaylord Sanitarium.  It was during those long, stationary, reflective months that he  thought back over all the purposeless living and the purposeless-  ness of people (as he saw them); as he saw the huge grinning  futility of every action and feeling, and he decided to try to set  down some of it. It was here in this sanitarium that the creaking  but tireless mechanism of Eugene O'Neill began to grind.  What were the sources of disturbance in this disturbed and  socially mutinous man?  Eugene O'Neill's mother, Ella Quinlan, was a devout woman,  very much in love with her actor-husband James. She met him  in Cleveland about 1875 when he was performing there. She fell  in love at his first performance. Later they met. They were  married, and she toured with him everywhere.  Her first child, James, Jr., came in 1878, Eugene ten years  later. There was another son who died at the age of two.  In the days when this couple was travelling, it was not uncommon for doctors—especially for "hotel" doctors—to prescribe  laudanum (or morphine) for any severe pain. Many women,  living today, have born children with the mercy of this drug,  perhaps without even knowing what they had taken. My own  grandmother carried laudanum in her pocketbook. When I was  six, she gave me some for a toothache.  • 5 	asu06600000030007001							66758196 Bytes	3845	5784	4011542432	RGB	8	600	asu06600000030007001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/315	315	316.jp2	/asu0660/image/316.jp2
Aspects of E.G.O. (Eugene Gladstone O'Neill)					Wylie, Max, 1904-																											asu0660000003	/  With a drug so effective, so cheap, and so available (no prescription was needed), it is not surprising that morphine  addiction, among the most "correct" people, was not unknown.  Eugene O'Neill's mother became a morphine addict. But she  was a strong-willed woman, and to her own heroic credit, she was  able, with the aid of priests and the devotion of Catholic sisters  (mostly in St. Leo's Church of Mary Reparatrix on East 28th  Street in New York), to "kick" this habit and to do so completely  and forever. The last 25 years of her life were entirely clear of  any dependence on drugs. But it is also equally true that she  was addicted at the time Eugene was born (October 16, 1888).  The clinical aspects of this—the pharmacological aspects—  are horrifying to contemplate. In one shocking sentence what the  mother's condition meant to the unborn Eugene was simple: he  was himself a dope addict while still in his mother's womb.  Worse, within a few hours after birth (at 44th and Broadway),  Eugene O'Neill began to suffer for the lack of the drug that had  kept him ecstatically comfortable for so many months. Withdrawal symptoms appeared. No relief was provided. The cause  and extent of his early agonies were, of course, never suspected.  Today it is considered possible that many behavior problems  and involved neurotic patterns that have defied solution or treatment or diagnosis can be explained through the shattering fact of  drug addiction at birth; the traumatic effect on the entire nervous  mechanism that the violence of sudden withdrawal would have.  There is now some literature on the subject. There was none at  the time Eugene O'Neill was born.  In a paper read before a group of doctors by D. T. Read, MD,  titled Congenital Morphinism, at Harkness Pavilion in New York  City on September 24, 1958, the following pertinent sentences  appear:  The important feature is that infants of mothers  who are actively addicted and taking narcotics  during their pregnancy, these infants exhibit withdrawal symptoms shortly after birth similar to  those of a narcotic addict deprived of his drug.  The addiction of the infant usually matches that  of the mother, and the separation from the maternal circulation with the cutting of the cord, shuts 	asu06600000030008001							69378472 Bytes	3964	5832	3314478716	RGB	8	600	asu06600000030008001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/316	316	317.jp2	/asu0660/image/317.jp2

(Eugene Gladstone O'Neill)					Wylie, Max, 1904-																											asu0660000003	off the supply of drug to the newborn and withdrawal symptoms ensue within three days, usually  commencing at 24 hours, reach a peak by the  third day, and gradually subside in 5-14 days if  the infant survives.  There is one more possible clue to Eugene O'Neill's personality, to the perpetual anxiety he suffered, the instability he  exhibited through his entire life, a clue to his rage, and general  infantalism, in some of the closing sentences in Dr. Read's  remarkable paper:  It is interesting to speculate on the predisposition of such infants to become addicts later in  life. It is recognized that the permanent cure rate  of juvenile, adolescent, and adult heroin addicts  is extremely poor. I can't help but feel, if the  desire to return to the womb is present in all of  us, how much stronger the urge must be to return  to their uterine ecstasy in infants such as these.  Though Eugene O'Neill did not find his way to dope (it is  hard to think how he missed), he soon found his way to alcohol.  His brother Jamie had done so before him. Alcohol killed Jamie  in a Connecticut asylum, in 1923. And alcohol cruelly tormented  Eugene during a great part of his life. For most of the time he  was writing his finest work, he was also fighting alcohol. He did  not know he was an alcoholic. Neither the word alcoholism nor  the disease was known, used, or understood during the period  of O'Neill's most productive output—the 1920's.  He drank intermittently, and fought the effects of drinking all  the time. His wife Agnes, a patient and remarkably perceptive  woman with keen intelligence and great powers of observation,  remarked over and over that once his intake had reached a certain point, he could not stop; that he had to go on drinking until  he was immobilized by it or unconscious from it; that he had no  control whatever. Today this inability to stop, once the drinker  has been "triggered," is known as one of the true signs of the  alcoholic; that alcoholism is a disease, that the alcoholic is  powerless over his drinking, once it begins.  One of the most pitiful entries in the scattered O'Neill diary is  • 7 	asu06600000030009001							67357140 Bytes	3877	5788	1823177516	RGB	8	600	asu06600000030009001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/317	317	318.jp2	/asu0660/image/318.jp2

It is impossible to read that short phrase without  pity, for indeed it is one of the few utterances of his, of spontaneous unrehearsed anguish.  Of course he never prayed, but he was most fervently seeking  an escape from the continuing disasters that liquor always  brought him to. He just did not know the great secret that most  successfully arrested alcoholics know above all others: the first  drink is the crippler. Stay away from the first.  He never knew this (no one did), so every time he started,  though his intentions might be mild, he got stoned.  Eugene was disloyal, ungracious, childish, (babyish even),  perpetually self-pitying, brave in the presence of the elements but  cowardly everywhere else; cowardly in the presence of bills,  people, world-created reality of any sort. He was a bully who,  to be handled, had to be bullied, like bullies everywhere. He was  a born taker, a money conniver, large-scale self-justifier who,  though he never seems to have told a deliberate and direct  untruth, was so nimble at blame-placing and so remembering of  previous hurt (real or not) that he could, and did, rationalize  every situation the instant it became uncomfortable. Everything  unpleasant was always the fault of someone else, usually someone  right around him. In his second marriage (his most productive)  to Agnes Boulton, she was the brunt of most of his ill-temper:  as, indeed, she was the recipient of his rare and euphoric good  feeling in the brief moments when such might appear.  But he was essentially a taker and not a giver. When he did  give, it was always for a poor, or neurotic, reason, and was  instantly insisting upon thanks, even before the gift had arrived.  He missed the whole idea of giving, and in that simple misconstruction, he also missed the whole idea of living.  He represented the murky distinction, in money matters,  between a planned putting aside and on out-and-out cheating.  He kept talking of honor while having so little; of loneliness while  manufacturing his own; and of truth when he could not recognize  it standing in full silhouette in his own doorway.  Yet he is no less, nor more, disturbed than hundreds of other  creative people. We think of the painters Gaugin and Van Gogh;  of the poets Verlaine, Rimbaud, Baudelaire, and Edgar Allen  '• 8 	asu06600000030010001							68835100 Bytes	3947	5810	1170343085	RGB	8	600	asu06600000030010001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/318	318	319.jp2	/asu0660/image/319.jp2
Aspects of E.G.O. (Eugene Gladstone O'Neill)					Wylie, Max, 1904-																											asu0660000003	Poe; of such writers as Dostoyevsky, Kafka, James Joyce. Mention any artist and you touch the quick of unusual responses.  In the case of O'Neill, though, it is odd that no one has yet  written of the truly remarkable parallel, the personality similarity  between O'Neill and the more familiar and more carefully studied  Jonathan Swift. Some of their basic resemblances, as intellectual  odd-balls and social anomalies, are astonishing. Here, to me,  seem to be the principal ones:  1. Psychiatrists would classify both men as belonging to the  school of chronic suppressed rage; to organization through  opposition.  2. To both artists, women were seen as the devourers, the real  seducers. This theme and treatment of women is consistent  enough in O'Neill's plays to have definite psychiatric meaning.  When it is pointed out that this is not at all the way the woman  is treated in Anna Christie, there is nonetheless a devouring spirit  there too: the sea.  3. To the ends of their lives, both artists were afflicted with  severe anxiety, amounting at times to active insanity or emotional  disintegration—weeping, screaming, flailing.  4. Both artists suffered with extreme general hypochondriasis.  Yet both had good general health. Both kept constantly compensating for imaginary ailments. Swift was a confirmed taker of  long walks. O'Neill was almost comical in his self-observance:  taking his pulse after measured exercises: running in place;  punching the bag, measuring his chest expansion, counting his  strokes in swimming; counting distances; keeping a wall-chart of  pulse, respiration, return to "normal" after exercise. Perpetual  talk about how he felt; disinterest in how others felt.  O'Neill probably never had tuberculosis. His heavy smoking,  his love of swimming (at which he was notably accomplished),  his long-windedness, his insistence upon living next to ocean  waters most of his life—all suggest that if he actually had lung-  spots, the kind of life he lived would have advanced his  consumption, not arrested it. It was heavy exercise that killed  Keats (mountain-climbing) and the same thing would have had  the same effect on O'Neill if the infection had in fact existed.  5. Both spent much time with doctors, and both had almost  psychopathic hatred of nurses. This was more extreme with Swift  •9  i 	asu06600000030011001							67625412 Bytes	3904	5772	453397442	RGB	8	600	asu06600000030011001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/319	319	320.jp2	/asu0660/image/320.jp2

In  the O'Neill correspondence there are 72 doctors mentioned by  name; what he went to them for, what they did (good or bad)  for him.**  6. Both men were absurdly suspicious.  7. Both had marked bi-sexuality and both probably suffered,  Swift more than with O'Neill, with latent homosexual panic.  8. Both accepted the bounty of others, gave little in return.  O'Neill was extraordinarily shabby in this area. He would sulk in  cheap hotel rooms, waiting for the phone to ring, waiting for  others to invite him to country places, races, rides in the mountains, dinners, teas, shows. Surely he was one of the stingiest  Americans ever born. Even in funds he managed a perpetual  peasant terror of poverty.  9. Neither O'Neill nor Jonathan Swift could communicate with  children. O'Neill, of course, could not communicate even with his  own. He might reach out and gently touch one of his children as  he passed; pat a head or shoulder. But he never dug in the sand-  dunes or beaches with them; never taught them to swim, fish,  row, paddle. Never played with them. He did not understand  play, nor the importance of it to a child.  The few children who appear in his plays are grotesquely  mechanical, in speech and in the stage directions that activate  them. He never took a good look at a child, nor spent an hour  of his whole life wondering what was going on in his children's  minds. So they were all lost; early.  Eugene, Jr. had three quick, futile marriages, all of them  emotionally shabby, all of them breaking up early, without issue.  It is possible the father felt guilty about the son, though it is  doubtful he ever felt guilty about Shane, ten years younger. It is  **In 1927, at age 40, O'Neill could say he got a real kick out of meeting "these  3 doctors" — all young men, college graduates. This fact always impressed him.  After his own son's suicide (Eugene O'Neill, Jr.), Eugene was asked by the son's  best friend, Frank Meyer, what the playwright wanted of his son's effects. He  had an instant answer: "His Yale diploma." But about the doctors: he points out  that these special three doctors were in the top ranks of their profession, that  they were high-grade men, genuinely fine, that their personal ties were of the  highest, and that in addition they were men of "muscle." One was a former  wrestler (Princeton), another a former varsity oarsman (Harvard). Without doubt,  O'Neill was conscious of masculine power, feeling safe in the physical strength  of others, as he did when surrounded by the Hudson Dusters in the Hell Hole  saloon in 1917 and '18.  • 10 	asu06600000030012001							67252076 Bytes	3941	5685	2254647855	RGB	8	600	asu06600000030012001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/320	320	321.jp2	/asu0660/image/321.jp2
Aspects of E.G.O. (Eugene Gladstone O'Neill)					Wylie, Max, 1904-																											asu0660000003	I  possible Eugene, Sr. had an unconscious envy of Eugene, Jr. for  physically the son represented something the father himself  wished to be (the something he so admired in the doctors, big  muscles, plus Ivy League halo). Eugene, Jr. was black haired, as  was the playwright himself, but broad and tall; a burnished  Viking, six feet three, two hundred and fifteen pounds, booming  voice, black beard, dramatic bravura manner. This noisy exterior  concealed a pacific, domestic, sentimental nature. At age 39  Eugene, Jr. slept with a teddy-bear of childhood days, kept cats,  cooked, sewed; oddly epicene in a structure of boisterous vitality,  he needed both mothering and fathering, got neither, yet would  have been a fine father himself. Or a good mother.  Eugene, Jr. kept trying to create some relation with his father.  Agnes, the step-mother, encouraged this. Eugene, Jr.'s brilliance  was sufficient in itself to establish such a claim on his father's  attention and any father except the pusillanimous playwright  would have been proud to have sired something as versatile. But  the son could never get anything but superficial recognition (and  occasional weekends) from the father; a short holiday in Paris  when Eugene Jr. was a student in Germany; "Come but don't  bring your wife" when O'Neill, married now for the third time,  was living in California.  Eugene, Jr. began drinking at Yale. He was drinking heavily  when I knew him (his CBS days, when he was often heard on  Lyman Bryson's "Invitation to Learning" and "People's Platform"). His arrogance emphasized, rather than hid, his inner  hurt, his dreadful insecurity. Booze, bombast, money pressures,  gasconading, and girl-chasing of prep-school flamboyance, filled  his days and nights. And emptied his spirit.  Before mentioning the tenth and last similarity, and the possible origins, of the personalities of Swift and O'Neill, I wish to  add an illuminating but not very edifying note on the last days  of Eugene O'Neill, Jr., and a speculation or two concerning these.  About noon, swollen with gin, Eugene, Jr. went upstairs in his  frame house, ran a tub of hot water, stepped in, opened his  wrists, then opened a vein in his left leg above the ankle, and  waited for the end. It did not come quickly. In this position he  bled for about 20 minutes. An impulse to go on living suddenly  hit him after he had become quite weak from bleeding. He  • 11 	asu06600000030013001							68117236 Bytes	3931	5774	1081588641	RGB	8	600	asu06600000030013001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/321	321	322.jp2	/asu0660/image/322.jp2

He struggled out into the hall and fell again.  Then he tumbled down the first flight of stairs to the landing  where the telephone was. Here he tore at the phone but it was  dead. He had not paid the bill and service had been cut off. He  fell once more, tumbled down the second flight, somersaulted  into the living-room but was not able again to get up.  There he died.  He was found later the same day in this gory mess by Elsie  Meyer, wife of his close friend, the brilliant and eccentric Frank  Meyer. I saw the place. I met the Meyers. I have the State Police  record of this suicide before me.  This happened on September 25, 1950, in Woodstock, in the  Catskills, a beautiful spot, especially appealing in September.  But a poor way to go out—a brilliant and salvageable son hunting and fossicking throughout his whole life for his brilliant  unsalvageable, unfindable father; hopelessly hunting as others  would, as others had.  10. Now for the final similarity between Jonathan Swift and  Eugene O'Neill: In both there were severe and limiting pre-  genital determinants. Swift's father was already dead when  Jonathan was born. O'Neill's father, though far from dead, had  so little time for Eugene that he might as well have been dead;  he had no more time for Eugene than Eugene, later, could find  for his own children. The father, a matinee idol of huge talents  and even larger cupidity, was almost constantly on the road.  Eugene was brought up by a nurse, a kind person, more resilient  than bright, and both patient and sorely tried. She showed up,  out of spontaneous loyalty, when Eugene's mother died, but  Eugene refused to step into the funeral parlor to speak to her.  Perhaps she revived too many memories of the unbearable loneliness of his childhood. Jonathan Swift had many of the same  memories and he has anathematized nurses to the point of  immortalizing them.  With O'Neill, perhaps the significant point could be this: he  had no real father on whom to play out his oedipal development.  None of this seems in the least important—exploring the man  O'Neill—when set against the work he was able to do. But isn't  it interesting? And wasn't it awful?  * 12 	asu06600000030014001							68098964 Bytes	3965	5723	1382725788	RGB	8	600	asu06600000030014001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/322	322	323.jp2	/asu0660/image/323.jp2

Notes					Selle, Mildred H.																											asu0660000003	NOTES  By Mildred H. Selle  IN ORDER to strengthen the University Library's holdings  in the political and social history of England during the  seventeenth century, we have lately added several Dugdale  titles, several William Camden titles, and many early editions  of various works by Jeremy Taylor, Richard Baxter, and Bishop  Laud, among English divines, as well as many early editions of  Dryden, Evelyn, Quarles, and other seventeenth century literary  figures.  Gifts in recent years have contributed handsomely to our  holdings in this period. In the collection of pamphlets presented  to the Library by Theodore Parker, several hundred in all, fully  fifty or more were published in the seventeenth century, fourteen  of these items forming a closely related group of Parliamentary  ordinances and similar works published during the explosive  years of the Puritan Revolution. Three broadsides of the same  period, the gift of Mrs. O. J. Tanner, make a vital, indeed an  exciting, addition to this group.  Nearly all of these items from the years 1642-1660 can be  called rare; while two of them are identified in Wing's Short-Title  Catalogue . . .* as pamphlets that one can find in five (or perhaps  more) English or Scottish libraries and five American libraries,  most of the others have been located by that same bibliographer  in far fewer collections on either side of the Atlantic. One  pamphlet we do not find in Wing. This is Die Martis, 16  Septemb. 1645. An Ordinance of the Lords and Commons . . .

Two-Gunned Gabriel in London					Emery, Clark Mixon, 1909-																											asu0660000003	TWO-GUNNED GABRIEL  IN LONDON  By Clark Emery  THE ADOLESCENT HERO of Dylan Thomas's Adventures in the Skin Trade signalizes his departure from  Wales by shredding photographs of his mother and  sister, defacing his schoolmaster-father's already-graded history  papers (My god, mun, after they were graded?), and destroying  the tea-service. It is a purposeful rite: ". . . come and see me  break the china without any noise so that I can never come  back." He should have quoted from Blake's Laocoon: "You must  leave Fathers & Mothers & Houses & Lands if they stand in the  way of Art."  Having disposed of these, he turns his attention to society at  large. On the train to London, he monopolizes the lavatory for  hours, redeeming the time by ripping and flushing away names  and addresses of people in London who could be of use to him.  "Home and help were over . . . Many people have begun worse,  he said aloud. I am ignorant, lazy, dishonest, and sentimental,  I have the pull over nobody."  Whether Thomas himself when he departed Wales for London  acted with such overt violence is not a matter of record. There  can be little doubt, however, that the story manifests Thomas's  state of mind. He left Wales a rebel against the forces that had  tried to mold him into a workaday Welshman; he arrived in the  city a rebel against those that would try to shape him into a  London litterateur: a First just down from Oxford and slated for  the diplomatic, with a volume of verses on the remainder shelves.  Thomas, like the boy in the lavatory, is a country-cousin to the  Byronic hero, rootless and alone, self-pitying, self-loathing, and  given to theatrical gesture. The differences are in superficials.  He does not look nor dress (he wears a hard brown hat, "that  symbol of middle-class divinity") like a Marvelous Boy, and his  gesture, satirizing the Byronism which he knows persists, is at  once pathetic and self-derisory. His vanity is too great for his  self-depreciation to be authentic, and of this he is aware. (A letter  written to Vernon Watkins in 1938 shows that he was never at  evens with himself: "A sense of humour is, I hope, about to be  • 16 	asu06600000030022001							68117356 Bytes	3968	5719	31272628	RGB	8	600	asu06600000030022001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/330	330	331.jp2	/asu0660/image/331.jp2

In a society he despises for taking stances, he is himself a  stance-taker. His doubt must be whether an element of hypocrisy  taints a stand against hypocrisy. The doubt is not resolved in this  prose piece. He knows pretty well what he is against: "I have  always been brought up to believe that Mortimer Street is what  is right, and I would not wish that on anybody." But he is uncertain of what he is for and too conscious of his own inadequacy to  dare even to plan a positive program. He is left with a snook  to cock, not un-self-directed.  His start in London is not auspicious: rebellious but uncertain;  fearful, but so determined to defeat fear as to act with rashness;  obsessed with the idea of breaking all ties, but guilt-ridden. It is  quite in the order of things that his first experience of Life (as  opposed to llife in Wales) should devolve into a series of anticlimaxes.  But it is experience. He participates in the "life of that mythical  man-in-the-street," and finds it something other than dull as ditch  water. "The ceaseless toil for bread and butter, the ogres of  unemployment, the pettifogging gods of gentility, the hollow lies  of the marriage-bed" may have made the man-in-the-street "a  mere bundle of repressions and useless habits," and Thomas may  have fought against himself being infected. Nevertheless, coming  to understand that his own fears, guilts, excessive responses, and  anticlimaxes were, as Gertrude remarked to Hamlet, common,  he is moved to a compassion that does not dull his rebelliousness  but illuminates it:  The light of the one weak lamp in a rusty circle fell  across the brickheaps and the broken wood and the  dust that had been houses once, where the small and  hardly known and never-to-be-forgotten people of the  dirty town had lived and loved and died and, always,  lost.  A sympathetic understanding of the losers he might have; a  program for the reform of their condition he did not. Thomas  (sure that dogmas implement their bark) seems never to have  been doctrinaire in any way. He does not refer to the Depression  as such; he does not join organizations with colored shirts to  • 17 	asu06600000030023001							68303536 Bytes	3916	5812	1176272507	RGB	8	600	asu06600000030023001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/331	331	332.jp2	/asu0660/image/332.jp2

His business, as he saw it, was to observe, to  experience, to understand, and to utter the life, love, death of the  individual, in his common-placeness and his uniqueness, not to  construct Tables of Organization.  He did not, of course, advocate poverty as a seed-bed for  nurturing the toughly alive and quaintly idiosyncratic. But he  was also not unaware of the homogenized creamlessness that  could result from universal middle-class liberalism. ("The reason  I haven't written for such a time is . . . because I have been in  London, in penury, and in doubt: In London because money  lives and breeds there; in penury, because it doesn't; and in doubt  as to whether I should continue as an outlaw or take my fate for  a walk in the straight and bowler-treed paths.")  The tyranny of respectability bulked larger in his mind than  that of poverty; and the tyranny of time does not reveal itself, as  it does in Yeats, as an impoverishment of the physical body, but  as a closing of the shades of the prison-house upon the growing  boy. Children, drunkards, and lovers (that is, outlaws) rather  than soberly-married adults are the heroes of Thomas's stories,  plays, and poems. Thomas inveterately allies himself with those  who do not think that the law is instinct with perfect virtue and  that its enforcers take that virtue upon themselves. He sees the  law (moral, ecclesiastical, or otherwise) not as an end but as a  means the infringement of which does not necessarily impugn  the true end.  If he did not have a program to advocate, he did have a vocation to pursue—learning the craft of poetry. However boisterously  he socialized in these early days and later, apparently dissipating  his time and powers, a dedicated part of him was always monas-  tically secluded, quietly sifting the worldly experience to salvage  that which could be put to the service of the god of verse-men.  Dissipation, in fact, was not a dissipating but a recouping of the  time wasted whoring after the false gods of Mortimer Street.  Believing with Blake that the road of excess leads to the palace  of wisdom, he swore the vows of poverty, disobedience, and  unchastity, damning braces, blessing relaxes.  In How to be a Poet he pokes mild fun at the "Provincial Rush,  •18 	asu06600000030024001							68900304 Bytes	3974	5776	2155133324	RGB	8	600	asu06600000030024001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/332	332	333.jp2	/asu0660/image/333.jp2
Two-Gunned Gabriel in London					Emery, Clark Mixon, 1909-																											asu0660000003	or the Up-Rimbaud and-At-em approach" to becoming a successful poet. But the requirements he posits for success are  precisely those he possessed: "a will and slight delirium"; and  "a thirst and constitution like that of a salt-eating pony, a hippo's  hide, boundless energy, prodigious conceit, no scruples, and . . .  a home to go back to . . ." This description was written retrospectively. It is doubtful that he would have been so objectively  self-amused fifteen years earlier and almost certain that at that  time of calculated severance he would not have stipulated the  home to return to.  But during those fifteen years he had made his success, won  faithful friends, married, become a father, experienced a war,  assumed the responsibilities, important and trivial, that attend  success (of meeting dead-lines, proof-reading, lecturing, recording, broadcasting, staging). All are matters demanding the  subjugation of the individual's whims to the needs of the group.  Of course his major responsibility was still to himself. As he  remarked:  ... a poet is a poet for such a very tiny bit of his life;  for the rest, he is a human being, one of whose responsibilities is to know and feel, as much as he can, all that  is moving around and within him, so that his poetry,  when he comes to write it, can be his attempt at an  expression of the summit of man's experience on this  very peculiar and, in 1946, this apparently hell-bent  earth.  The paradox of the poet is that the more intently he honors his  responsibility to himself the more effectively he can discharge his  duty to society. It may be for his own satisfaction, but it is in  society's interest that he learn his craft: the turning to his own  account of the successes in manner and matter of his forerunners;  the discriminating among values; the stabilizing of a point of  view; the individualizing of images; the building of a working  vocabulary; the teaming of sense and sensibility; the meshing of  inner and outer worlds.  It was not easy for Thomas, for these are labors of ordering  and organizing undertaken by one whom Dostoyevsky might  have been describing: "... I feel as though I were split in two . ..  It's just as though one's second self were standing beside one; one  • 19 	asu06600000030025001							67427316 Bytes	3887	5779	1960802831	RGB	8	600	asu06600000030025001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/333	333	334.jp2	/asu0660/image/334.jp2

A divided self in a splintering  world (cosmologically as well as culturally) for whom traditional  or dogmatic systematizations were repugnant; a Gerontion or a  Blake, not a Ulysses or a Hopkins. How difficult he found the  process of sorting out and neatly fitting together is revealed in a  letter to Watkins:  . . . I'm almost afraid of all the once-necessary artifices  and obscurities, and can't, for the life or death of me,  get any real liberation, any diffusion or dilution or anything, into the churning bulk of the words; I seem,  more than ever, to be tightly packing away everything  I have and know into a mad-doctor's bag, and then  locking it up: all you can see is the bag, all you can  know is that it's full to the clasp, all you have to trust  is that the invisible and intangible things packed away  are—if they could only be seen and touched—worth  quite a lot.  He would have liked to be, but could not, as he imagined  Watkins to be: ". . . the one happy person I know, the one who,  contrary to facts and, in a certain way, to circumstances, seems  to be almost entirely uncomplicated; not, either, the uncomplica-  tion of a beginning person, but that of a person who has worked  through all the beginnings and finds himself a new beginning in  the middle . . ."  It is perhaps not irrelevant that at the time (1936) when he  wrote this, Thomas was reviewing for the Morning Post almost  exclusively mystery stories. Mysteries appeal to intellectuals  essentially because in them reason, order, and certitude triumph.  The story itself has a volitional definiteness of narrative line; the  hero is unambiguously the controlling agent; the rational dispels  the irrational, the god-like objective (with wisdom, temperance,  justice, and fortitude) quells conflicting subjectivities; the aberrational is reduced to the normal; in the final chapter, the hot  soul gets refreshing answers. It may be that Thomas found  refreshment here. And support for an opinion. In answer to the  question asked in 1934, "Do you think there can now be use for  narrative poetry?" he answered:  Yes. Narrative is essential.

Two-Gunned Gabriel in London					Emery, Clark Mixon, 1909-																											asu0660000003	poetry of the present has no narrative movement, no  movement at all, and is consequently dead. There must  be a progressive line, or theme, of movement in every  poem. The more subjective a poem, the clearer the narrative line. Narrative, in its widest sense, satisfies what  Eliot, talking of "meaning," calls "one habit of the  reader." Let the narrative take that one logical habit of  the reader along with its movement, and the essence  of the poem will do its work on him.  When, much later, he commented on his early poems, he did  not visualize them as Poirots or Peter Wimseys, clearly impelled  and inevitably moving, but as bobbies:  ... I like to think that the poems most narrowly odd  are among those I wrote earliest, and that the later  poems are wider and deeper . . .  I do not remember — that is the point — the first  impulse that pumped and shoved most of the earlier  poems along, and they are still too near to me, with  their vehement beat-pounding black and green rhythms  like those of a very young policeman exploding, for me  to see the written evidence of it.  Nevertheless, in spite of facts and circumstances, and devotedly, if vehemently, pounding his beat, he realized the potential  of his precocity. He was only twenty when his first book of poems  was published. And his second appeared only two years later.  Neither was gladly received by the general public. And only  a segment of the fit few truly cared for them, since they constituted, whether intentionally or not, a reaction to a reaction.  For the bulk of verse-readers, Georgian poetry, with its carryover of good-mannered pastoralism, was still the norm. The  elect, of course, had rebelled: there were, on the one hand, the  aged but sharp-eyed eagles appraising the Western shards for  their imagistic qualities and their quotient of despair; on the  other were the young airmen surveying the terrain, noting the  areas of decay but more particularly, in the context of The New  Plan, finding good locations for industrial parks and workers'  communities.  Thomas's volumes did not encourage the Left, justify the  Right, or satiate the Middle with formulas.

But there was a new note here, a new tone, and a new  world, whether brave or not, which demanded attention, even  though it began or ended in irritation. Thames-side Left Bankers  were first to find their way—they had, after all, explored Rimbaud, Breton, Lawrence, Yeats, and Joyce. And even the Academics had accustomed themselves to Donne and Blake and  Hopkins. Further, Edith Sitwell, socially respectable for some  and poetically respectable for others, at least made it indefensible  to ignore the strange new poems.  So this late-adolescent, not English but Welsh, not Etonian  nor Oxonian but from Swansea Grammar School, not Marxist  nor Moseleyan nor an interesting Catholic convert or American  expatriate, un-bowlered, un-umbrella-ed, unsponsored by a  Pound or Bridges or Murry, and without the accent of an Eliot  or an Auden, made his appearance and captured his audience.  Durrell's Pursewarden recalls invading London, encountering  binoculared men scanning the city, searching for new talent.  "Great God! It was for us they were waiting and watching! Then  the kindly policeman lowered his voice confidentially and said  in hollow and reverent tones: 'They are waiting for the new  Trollope to be born!'"  Like Pursewarden, Thomas had been thinking "of a kind of  illumination such as Rimbaud dreamed of — a nagging poem  which was not didactic or expository but which infected . . .";  like Pursewarden he had encountered "a million muffin-eating  moralists." But his talent and his luck and his grit were with  him. And he climbed as fast and as high as Horatio Alger could  have wished, and without marrying the boss's daughter.  22 	asu06600000030028001							69083572 Bytes	3958	5815	3653909648	RGB	8	600	asu06600000030028001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/336	336	337.jp2	/asu0660/image/337.jp2

Contributors to This Issue																																asu0660000003	j  CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS ISSUE  Max Wylie, after graduation from Hamilton College in 1928,  taught the history of the English novel in India's Punjab University. His first novel, Hindu Heaven, and his current novel, Never  the Twain, have India as their setting. A preoccupation with  Eugene O'Neill as a man impelled Mr. Wylie's novel based on  the life of the playwright, Trouble in the Flesh. In the leading  article of this issue of The Carrell, Mr. Wylie documents the  underlying causes of O'Neill's tragic life history. Max Wylie is  the son of Edna Edwards, early 20th Century novelist, and the  brother of author Philip Wylie.  Mildred H. Selle, wife of Professor of English Carl Selle, enjoys a busman's holiday as Assistant Acquisitions Librarian of  the University of Miami Library.  Clark Emery, Professor of English, spent years of research and  synthesis in his writing of Ideas Into Action — A Study of Ezra  Pound's Poetry, published by the University of Miami Press  without benefit, in the early stages, of critical attention, yet recently beginning to receive belated laurels. Dr. Emery with like  patience and integrity is addressing his studies to the poetry of  Dylan Thomas.  Richard L. Merrick, in order to dispell misconceptions that this  publication was named in honor of Hurricane Carol or a Christmas melody of same name, has illustrated the cover of this issue  with that lone study alcove known since the Middle Ages as a  carrell. The word may be spelled with one "1" or two. Mr.  Merrick happened to have two "l's" in his hand-made font and  was unwilling to choose between them.

Florida Shown on 1528 Turkish Map					Douglas, Marjory Stoneman																											asu0660000010	THE  CARRE LL  Volume 5 December, 1964 Number 2  FLORIDA SHOWN ON  1528 TURKISH MAP  By Marjory Stoneman Douglas  A PHOTOGRAPHIC COPY of a rare and little known  Turkish map of 1528, one of the oldest to show the  North American coast and Florida, has been presented  to the Library by David O. True of Miami. Mr. True is known  as a student of what new American history is to be learned from  the earliest maps of North American discoveries. He had this  copy made at the Topkapi Museum at Istanbul, converted in  1923 from the ancient Topkapi Palace of the Ottoman Sultans  after the Turkish Republic won its long wars with the Ottoman  Empire. This world map of 1528, with its predecessor of 1513,  was found in 1929, after having lain unknown for four centuries.  The map was drawn by the Turkish Admiral Piri Reis, who  was also the Ottoman navy's greatest navigator and cartographer.  In those early days of the sixteenth century, the Ottoman Turks  had taken Istanbul and dominated Asia Minor, the Black Sea,  the Balkans, the Adriatic and the Mediterranean, in the Golden  Age of their power and culture. Their land troops were holding  and penetrating north from the Balkans. Their navies were their  greatest strength, controlling all those seas with fleets of long,  low, sinister ships, sharp high lateen sails like the wings of great  sea birds, fluttering with flags bearing emblems of the sword or  crescent on blue and red fields. They had battled victoriously  against the Venetian Navy and the Genoese, the Knights of St.  John and the Spaniards. They were looking with aroused attention beyond the Pillars of Hercules to "The Great Ocean" and  learning all they could of lands to the west. The Empire would  reach as far east as Iraq and Iran and west to the gates of Vienna.  • 1 	asu06600000100003001							63872132 Bytes	3806	5592	3015261113	RGB	8	600	asu06600000100003001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/344	344	345.jp2	/asu0660/image/345.jp2

In 1494 Piri Reis served as commander,, or "Reis," of a Turkish ship under his uncle the Admiral Kemal Reis, who has been  called to aid the besieged Moorish Moslems in Granada and  transport them to North Africa. In 1501 Piri Reis took part in  the capture of seven Spanish ships. In one chart room were found  maps and documents used by Christopher Columbus in his voyages to the New World, with the map of 1498 attributed to him.  One prisoner may have served in that chart room on three voyages and was able to explain the maps and the Western discoveries as well as the trophies found aboard, red, green and black  peacock feather headdresses and dark hammer stones from "Antilia."  In a few years after the death of his uncle, Piri Reis stayed  ashore to draw his two world maps of 1513 and 1528, using as  sources his collection of some twenty earlier maps. These included  recent "Mappa Mundi" or world maps, one written in Arabic  about the Indian Ocean, and the map attributed to Columbus.  They were drawn and painted on the finest doeskin, with compass roses in color and decorations of elephants and ostriches.  He copied Columbus' map, which was incorrect for the West  Indies, so that the 1513 map repeats Columbus' mistakes. Piri  Reis corrected them from later maps for his map of 1528. It  was drawn in six sections of which all but one has been lost.  This, with a magnificent decorative corner border shows the  North Atlantic from Greenland to the Azores, Labrador, and,  most clearly and interestingly to us, Florida.  A caption in old Turkish marks Labrador that, recently translated by a Turkish scholar, reads, "They call this Bakile (Baca-  lao). The Portuguese discovered this, too. But what he found  was only the part sketched." Florida bears a caption which has  not yet been translated. It may be highly important if it indicates  what map Piri Reis used in drawing Florida.  Mr. True believes that it may have been derived from a map  of John Cabot who sailed that route around Florida to the Gulf  in 1498-1499, and whose maps influenced tremendously the map  makers of Europe, such as Juan de la Cosa in 1500. We have  copies of some of the maps Piri Reis owned that portray the 	asu06600000100004001							63866892 Bytes	3780	5630	3478318597	RGB	8	600	asu06600000100004001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/345	345	346.jp2	/asu0660/image/346.jp2

For this little understood  time, confused, as it was by the mistakes of map copyists, a find  like this of Piri Reis may bring a much clearer knowledge.  The, to us, newly revealed story of Piri Reis and his maps  is as fascinating as that whole period of Turkish conquest in and  about the Mediterranean, of which it is the epitome. He was  born near the Turkish Naval Base at Gallipoli on the Sea of  Marmora, where all the children, as was said, had ships for  cradles and took to the sea like alligators. His distinguished uncle,  Admiral Kemal Reis, took him aboard his flagship when he was  twelve years old, where he learned rapidly the seamanship and  navigation known then to the Turkish Navy. He showed an  astonishing keenness of observation and made voluminous notes  of everything he learned, saw and experienced on land and sea.  He took part in and received honors for his conduct in innumerable naval engagements, assaults and captures of fleets or  single ships, since the maritime conquests of the Ottoman Turks  were little distinguishable from savage acts of piracy.  At the same time, Piri Reis learned to speak fluent Greek,  Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese and began to make his reputation as the outstanding student of navigation and map making  in the Turkish world. His notes were written out and copied and  passed around among naval officers as the latest scientific  knowledge.  As ship commander, he dressed in the official uniform of ankle  length gown open over wide Turkish trousers that were bound  by a great sash, with a low hat like a turban and probably, a  captain's dashing moustachio. When his uncle died and he was  made admiral he is likely to have grown a great beard. His rich  dark long gown bordered with light fur, hung closed to his fine  slippers and he wore the admiral's remarkable headdress, a fluted  hat as tall as a mitre.  After he finished his great world maps at Gallipoli he went to  sea again as admiral of all the ships in the South Seas, which then  meant the Red and Arabian Seas and the Indian Ocean. He  played a great part in the campaigns of the Sultan Sulei the  Magnificent in the Red Sea. He died, greatly respected, in 1554  at the age of 84. 	asu06600000100005001							64547572 Bytes	3836	5607	823764971	RGB	8	600	asu06600000100005001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/346	346	347.jp2	/asu0660/image/347.jp2
Florida Shown on 1528 Turkish Map					Douglas, Marjory Stoneman																											asu0660000010	Besides his maps, Piri Reis' greatest contribution to Turkish  knowledge of the then world was made when he collected all his  notes, writings and observations into one book, partly written in  prose for Naval officers and the rest, as the custom was, in verse,  for the eye of the Sultan. It was called "Bahriye-ye" or "On  Navigation." The book was superbly hand written in Turkish  script and illuminated. The Sultan honored him greatly for it.  It was copied in some thirty-five versions or editions, the latest  in 1935.  In "Bahriye-ye" Piri Reis told of a book Columbus had obtained on his early voyage to Iceland, after reading which, Piri  Reis said, he went with Spanish ships to discover the Antilles.  For that reason he took a supply of glass beads with which to  trade with the natives. The book of which Piri Reis writes, according to Mr. True, could be none other than the often mentioned, lost and most mysterious "Inventio Fortunatae," a copy  of which was in Piri Reis' library. It is supposed also to have  been well known to John Cabot and the merchant-venturers for  whom he sailed out of Bristol to map and name Labrador. It is  mentioned in the recently discovered John Day letter of 1497  which describes the Bristol voyages. And it was mentioned, much  later, by Hakluyt.  "Inventio Fortunatae" or "the Golden Book" has been ascribed  to several early explorers of the North Atlantic, perhaps Hugh  of Ireland, but Mr. True feels that it must have been written by  a Carmelite monk of Oxford called, "Nicholas of Lynn" between  1340 and 1360. This man, or one very like him, is believed to  have voyaged beyond Iceland and Greenland, up the Davis Straits  into the Arctic, to have discovered Hudson Bay and to have seen  the Labrador coasts. In that century before 1492, ports and  coastal towns, the universities of Western Europe and the Portuguese Court of Henry the Navigator, seethed with speculation  and ideas about the world beyond the great Ocean which the  Vikings and the Portuguese had already crossed. The earliest  mapmakers were drawing their first tentative charts and the seagoing Turks studying plans for the conquest of the oceans. In  all that burst of energy we may be sure that that lost book played  a great part. The world maps and writings of Piri Reis, as his contributions to our knowledge of that far-off time, confirms it.  4  • 	asu06600000100006001							63832772 Bytes	3784	5621	1607649528	RGB	8	600	asu06600000100006001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/347	347	348.jp2	/asu0660/image/348.jp2

Remorse: Coldridge's Venture in Tragedy					Emery, Clark Mixon, 1909-																											asu0660000010	REMORSE  Coleridge's Venture in Tragedy  By Clark Emery  LIKE CONGREVE'S The Mourning Bride, Coleridge's  Remorse is a tragedy written by a great poet which  enjoyed a respectable popularity in its day but which  has not stood the test of time. There are a number of reasons  for its lack of staying power, some of them superficial but none  the less operative, some serious and valid.  Its greatest deficiency in the eyes of a modern audience is its  remoteness—geographical, temporal, and ideational. Of all the  great or once-great European nations, Spain is the least well-  known. Since the defeat of the Armada, the European (and  therefore the American) consciousness has been formed by  the philosophers, theologians, scientists, and poets of England,  France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Scandinavia. Spain's national sport, its music and dance, its architecture, the character  of the land and the people seem un-European. The historic  conflict in Spain between the Moors and the Spanish does  not engage the contemporary imagination; recent events have  even diminished the effect that the word Inquisition once had.  As a practical consideration, Coleridge would have done better  to choose Renaissance Italy as his locale. Shakespeare and the  Jacobeans have so familiarized us with that time and place  that it is not felt as a part of the dead past but of a lively  continuing present.  The remoteness of the time and place and its relative historical  insignificance induce in the auditor a kind of slackness of  attention which is transferred to the characters and their problems. We do not really see them as people experiencing life as  we do. We are removed from them as a tourist is from a native  or an adult from an adolescent. Shakespeare might have given  Alvar and Ordonio stature enough to survive. But as conceived  by Coleridge they are of a size with the exotically caparisoned  characters in Verdi who, without the music, are more interesting 	asu06600000100009001							64023552 Bytes	3813	5595	4008561271	RGB	8	600	asu06600000100009001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/350	350	351.jp2	/asu0660/image/351.jp2
Remorse: Coldridge's Venture in Tragedy					Emery, Clark Mixon, 1909-																											asu0660000010	for their costumes than their character. The initial slackness of  attention persists.  In addition to its remoteness, the play is marked by its narrowness—of characterization, thought, theme, and tone.  Comparison with Romeo and Juliet shows this clearly. In the  latter, Shakespeare varies and contrasts his characters and scenes  to give an impression that every bustling aspect of life is being  represented. Vulgar servants, dignified dukes, young lovers,  elderly parents, gay libertine, passionate vendetta-ist, scullion  and nurse, friar and apothecary all appear. Gross obscenity,  delicate lyricism, didacticism, and whimsy follow one another  in quick succession. The characters appear in the city street,  the bedroom, the banquet hall, the garden, the place of business,  the place of death. We see them alone, in couples, in groups,  and in crowds, eating and drinking, bartering and politicking,  loving and hating, blaspheming and praying. In what some  think the most tragic death in the play, Mercutio dies with a  jest on his lips.  There are no jests in Remorse, witty or broad; there is no  sense of domesticity, of a day's work being done, of life being  lived normally, encircling and controlling and absorbing aberrations from normality. Coleridge has dissected a narrow slice  of life, removed it from its context, and magnified it under a  microscope.  He has narrowed further by constructing a plot and inventing  characters whose sole function is to illustrate a theme. Romeo  and Juliet, as the title declares, is about people. Remorse, as its  title makes clear, is about an idea. Don Alvar has scarcely  regained his native soil after years of exile before he says,  The more behooves it I should rouse within him  Remorse! that I should save him from himself.  Coleridge has enunciated his theme in such a way as almost to  compel from an actor the upraised hand with finger extended  heavenward, the weighted pause following utterance of the keyword, and the smiting of an agonized breast—all the appurtenances of melodrama—thus ensuring that even the remotest member of his audience must recognize the seminal quality of the  speech and prepare his mind for what is to come. 	asu06600000100010001							63973804 Bytes	3808	5598	3992859926	RGB	8	600	asu06600000100010001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/351	351	352.jp2	/asu0660/image/352.jp2
Remorse: Coldridge's Venture in Tragedy					Emery, Clark Mixon, 1909-																											asu0660000010	Having with such promptness explained what he is going to do,  he begins at once to do it, and, after five acts of effort, he  concludes the play by explaining what he has done.  Delights so full, if unalloyed with grief,  Were ominous. In these strange dread events  Just Heaven instructs us with an awful voice,  That conscience rules us e'en against our choice.  Our inward Monitress to guide or warn,  If listened to; but if repelled with scorn,  At length as dire Remorse, she reappears,  Works in our guilty hopes, and selfish fears!  Still bids, Remember! and still cries, Too late!  And while she scares us, goads us to our fate.  There may be a theme in Romeo and Juliet, but if so it does  not obtrude. The events occur because the characters live their  way through the play because they are what and where they  are. The people are important, not the idea. But in Remorse  the events are arranged for one purpose only: to show the  progress made by Don Alvar in producing in his brother the  desired agenbite of inwit. Both Coleridge and Alvar are obsessed.  The theme has tremendous breadth of implication for the  twentieth century. Both psychiatrists and social philosophers  might use as epigraph for all their books Alvar's statement that  The past lives o'er again  In its effects, and to the guilty spirit  The ever-frowning Present is its image.  Whole nations and races are praying against their persecutors,  as Alvar prayed against his,  . . . that Remorse might fasten on their hearts,  And cling with poisonous truth, inextricable  As the gored lion's bite.  Indeed, mankind's present suicidal tendency, the effort to construct the ultimate weapon, nuclear or bacteriological, is often  ascribed to an inability to expiate a guilt too awful to be borne.  Mass-murder, the argument runs, leads to collective guilt for  which the only absolution comes to seem extinction of the race.  • 7 	asu06600000100011001							64442404 Bytes	3827	5611	2524558782	RGB	8	600	asu06600000100011001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/352	352	353.jp2	/asu0660/image/353.jp2
Remorse: Coldridge's Venture in Tragedy					Emery, Clark Mixon, 1909-																											asu0660000010	"Don't you find it a beautiful clean thought," said Rupert  Birkin in Women in Love, "a world empty of people, just  uninterrupted grass, and a hare sitting up?"  But it is the reader (receiving what he gives) who finds  ideas of such breadth in the play. Coleridge, focusing upon an  individual situation, and that located in the historical long ago  and far away, does not encourage generalization. This is not to  say that the play makes no social comment. Running concurrently with the guilt-remorse theme is an attack upon institutional tyranny. But since the institution is specifically the Catholic Church of the Spanish Inquisition and not a modern form  of tyranny, Coleridge seems to be flogging a dead horse. Further,  he appears to be doing so toward the end of popularizing a faith  which in actuality could be adopted only by those lucky few  who were not compelled by economic exigency to live in the  city and work in the factories.  He is as powerful as Blake or Shelley in his attack upon the  forces that impoverish man's spirit and force him into crime:  Each pore and natural outlet shrivelled up  By ignorance and parching poverty,  His energies roll back upon his heart,  And stagnate and corrupt, till, chang'd to poison,  They break out on him, like a loathsome plague-spot!  And there is justice in his description of a penal system that  unmoulds the essence of a prisoner's soul, "hopelessly deformed  By sights of evermore deformity." But he is very far from getting  down to cases in his implied solution of man's ills:  With other ministrations thou, O Nature!  Healest thy wandering and distempered child:  Thou pourest on him thy soft influences,  Thy sunny hues, fair forms, and breathing sweets;  Thy melodies of woods, and winds, and waters!  Till he relent, and can no more endure  To be a jarring and a dissonant thing  Amid this general dance and minstrelsy;  But, bursting into tears, wins back his way,  His angry spirit healed and harmonized  By the benignant touch of love and beauty.  8  • 	asu06600000100012001							63944100 Bytes	3804	5600	36004000	RGB	8	600	asu06600000100012001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/353	353	354.jp2	/asu0660/image/354.jp2
Remorse: Coldridge's Venture in Tragedy					Emery, Clark Mixon, 1909-																											asu0660000010	It will not be to Remorse but to Women in Love or some  comparable work that the modern reader will turn if he seeks  causes and effects of the contemporary dilemma. And, because  it ascends from the anecdotal to the mythological, he will find  in The Rime of the Ancient Mariner inducements to thought  that are missing in Remorse. Perhaps "thought," connoting  willed judgment, is the wrong word to describe the normal  response to the Rime, and its companion-pieces, Christabel and  Kubla Khan, poems with as little intellectual structure as may  be (and that little, as in the Rime, too much), poems that,  however precise their descriptive effects, never give the reader  a leg to stand on in time and space. The first response is, rather,  a disturbed, somewhat fearful wonderment, a marveling that  such things might be, coupled with a certainty that they are—  semper ubique ah omnibus. The mind is unfixed from its usual  moorings and may, not without pleasure, remain so. But it may,  if judgment is permitted to reassert itself, set a straight course  and explore those "... Truths above Sense . . . having their  evidence in themselves . . . the fountain of Ideas and the Light  of the Conscience."  Remorse lacks this quality of making the natural supernatural  and the supernatural natural. It is firmly fastened to time and  place, a time and place which are not magical but only Gothic;  and it demands attention to real, if irrational, life-size people  with a real, though arbitrarily-contrived problem which can be  considered only in human terms.  On the other hand, and perhaps as a consequence, the play  unlike the poems is a complete whole skilfully structured in its  parts. I. A. Richards says of the poems that "They are held together, if held they are, in ways we do well, in poetic reading,  not to inquire about," and, ascribing their "breathtaking vividness" to "this very incoherence, this absence of a moral or intellectual core," advises that "in reading them the more comprehending parts of our mind should go to sleep."  To understand the play, all of the mind must remain awake  and alert. For Coleridge has attempted and succeeded in an  exercise in retarded recognition, making what now happens turn  on what has happened in the past. But no character knows all  the truth of past events and all have in one way or another mis-  • 9 	asu06600000100013001							64300196 Bytes	3819	5609	2854947552	RGB	8	600	asu06600000100013001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/354	354	355.jp2	/asu0660/image/355.jp2

From the various confrontations  of the characters only vague hints and half-divulged facts ensue,  and these in a confused chronology. The reader must accord  almost every speech the kind of attention he accords speeches  in an Ibsen play, since, as in Ibsen, all forward movement is  geared to a revelation of the past. It is easier to miss the revelation in Coleridge than in Ibsen because Coleridge's blank verse  is less single-mindedly expository than Ibsen's prose and his  characters are more excitedly and flamboyantly passionate in  their speech and actions. Nevertheless, all the parts are there to  coalesce finally in a well-wrought whole. Here, as rarely elsewhere, Coleridge proves himself an artful craftsman capable of  working out in detail and to its completion a project of no small  intricacy.  Whether what he has so successfully constructed is properly  to be called tragedy is open to question. There is no question  about the play's assuming man's dignity and his responsibility  for his actions in a supernaturally-governed moral order, for  many critics the sine qua non of tragedy. But doubt does exist  as to whether Coleridge has situated within this framework, to  work his way to defeat or exaltation, a tragic hero.  The hero of the play appears to be Don Alvar. But, except in  his failure to reform his brother, his is the story of a success.  He is really the hero of a romantic love story who wins the girl  despite all odds. Ordonio might seem a more likely candidate as  tragic hero, but, like Iago, he is evil at the beginning and continues so to the end. He is too clearly beyond any redemption  to have interest save as a danger to Ordonio's happiness.  There are interesting reverse parallels between Othello and  Remorse. In the former, the hero marries early in the play, and  the story is concerned with an active evil agent's destruction of  the marriage. In Remorse, the marriage comes at the end as the  result of the active good agent's ability to withstand the evil  agent's machinations. Ordonio is Iago's counterpart in villainy,  but he is as much worked upon as working. Furthermore, he is  "agonistes" as Iago is not: he does suffer some pangs of conscience. But Coleridge does not sufficiently exploit the possibilities.  Our attention ought to be as narrowly focused upon Ordonio's  inner struggle as, in Othello, it is upon the Moor's. But most  10 • 	asu06600000100014001							63841944 Bytes	3811	5582	1149294610	RGB	8	600	asu06600000100014001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/355	355	356.jp2	/asu0660/image/356.jp2

Their hopes will be stronger than  their fears. And, at the end, their realization of those hopes will  leave any moral concern in abeyance. Ordonio will be soon forgotten and Alvar's failure swallowed up in his success.  Coleridge may, as a thinker, have something of the tragic  vision: the three magical poems derive their strength from his  ability to suggest the pervasivness, the "dark encroachment" of  evil, and his power of describing the wanton unexpectedness of  its eruptions in human action. But as a dramatist, he does not  show himself capable of producing the tragic response. Byron  flippantly remarked that all comedies end in marriage, all tragedies in death. Since Remorse ends in both, it defies definition.  It is nevertheless a very considerable achievement. Though it  has all the trappings of the Gothic novel—Inquisitors, dungeons,  mountain caves and barren sea-coasts, wizards and love-lorn  ladies—both the poetry and the characterization raise it high  above mere Gothicism. And though it serves as a vehicle for the  expression of Coleridge's intellectual interests, exalting Nature,  Freedom, and Love, it does not do so at the expense of dramatic  interest. It ought, perhaps, to be required reading every so often  if for no other reason than to disabuse us of the notions that  Coleridge could never complete a work of any magnitude and  that he was at home only in the realms of the marvelous or the  meditative and was totally incapable of entering into and projecting the human.  11 	asu06600000100015001							64574860 Bytes	3832	5614	853145547	RGB	8	600	asu06600000100015001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/356	356	357.jp2	/asu0660/image/357.jp2

Dramatic Revolt and Conservatism					Selle, Carl																											asu0660000010	Dramatic Revolt and Conservatism  By Carl M. Selle  THE SETTING is London in 1891, "the man's capital,"  so called in partial contrast to Paris, which the English  did not regard as quite real and which Sinclair Lewis  later called "that feminine and flirtatious refuge from reality."  London of Henry Irving, exclusive Clubs, social and mental  squirearchy, the noli-me-tangere of Rotten Row and worship of  of the horse, highly proper gentleman Fabianists, solid buildings  enclosing solid if at times stolid elegance, devoted servants who  made possible the endless life of leisure, the luxuries of the  Criterion Theatre, disdain for the middle classes and suburban  denizens (who were classified with the precision of a Linnaeus),  high society travelling abroad in a seasonal ritual that trailed  style and virtue to the lesser breeds of the Riviera, Baden-Baden,  and Venice, harmony and discipline among the lower classes  that amazed visitors — a metropolis diffusing the spirit of God's  in his heaven, all's right with London.  Into this safe, sane, hierarchic, colony-conscious capital Ibsen  dropped the bomb of Ghosts, which was presented by Mr. Jack  Thomas Grein's group, the Independent Theatre, at the Royalty  Theatre in Soho. William Archer, patriarch-translator of Ibsen  and, with Bernard Shaw, English Mohammed to the Norwegian  Allah, gathered the pained and angry protests and groans of the  establishment into a Dictionary of Abuse, based on the Richard  Wagner Schimpj-Lexicon (both of which later were the idea  behind H. L. Mencken's Schimpflexicon; it is momentarily relevant to mention that Mencken wrote the first book on Shaw—  1905). A few choice items in Archer's assemblage of the attacks  on Ghosts are: ". .. an open drain; a loathsome sore unbandaged;  a dirty act done publicly; a lazar-house with all its doors and  windows open . .. literary carrion . .. crapulous stuff ... a wicked  nightmare . . . maunderings of nookshotten Norwegians . . ."  Only a profound influence could produce such vituperation.  Shaw said that "the influence which Ibsen has had on England  [and on much of the rest of the world] is almost equal to the  influence which three revolutions, six crusades, a couple of foreign invasions and an earthquake would produce."  16 • 	asu06600000100020001							63769504 Bytes	3806	5583	220094967	RGB	8	600	asu06600000100020001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/361	361	362.jp2	/asu0660/image/362.jp2
Dramatic Revolt and Conservatism					Selle, Carl																											asu0660000010	Such dramatic revolt was felt even in distant China, which at  the beginning of this century was for most occidentals as remote  as any exotic cloudland. Placid, stoical Confucian China (meaning, often, outwardly Confucian but inwardly corrupt) heard  fearsome news from Korea and India and felt itself at the mercy  of the partitioning powers. Young Chinese intellectuals began  to see poverty, corruption, cruelty, the bound feet of women,  merciless mandarins through eyes widened by Western liberalism. Chinese students studying in Tokyo, in part emboldened by  the rising popularity of the vernacular, first expressed revolt  through drama by adapting Dumas's La Dame aux Camelias  (this play seems to have a moral for everything) and Uncle  Tom's Cabin. But it was Ibsen who brought their revolt to its  climax. To those who wanted to preserve the status quo he was  the worst sort of "ocean devil" violating national tradition,  stability, sanctity. To the young intellectuals he was bringer of  the gospel of blessed modernity, and came to be venerated with  prayer-like words: "Beloved teacher, at last we have found you."  Beginning about 1917, translations of Ibsen appeared in New  Youth, the leading organ of the liberal movement. When the  Norwegian was first performed, the Chinese stage had complete  segregation of the sexes and so the world-famous role of Nora  in A Doll's House was performed by men—a fantastic irony  inasmuch as Nora was by then the greatest symbol of womanly  refusal of conventional duty and of womanly rebellion.  Ibsen influenced Chinese drama and attending criticism in a  quantitative way that is both touching and amusing. Words like  hunger, exploitation, suppression were added up to totals that  became the criteria of literary excellence. One author stated:  "Although [my] play is aesthetically immature, I am glad to say  that I have touched on matrimony and rural bankruptcy, the  two up-to-date social problems confronting us." At other times  the Ibsenian Chinese drama became relatively forceful as both  art form and message. Kuo Mo-jo wrote three historical plays  in the early twenties called, typically: Three Rebellious Women. He recreated the story of a widow of about 100 B.C. who  eloped with the scholar Ssu-ma Hsiang-ju who had wooed her  by playing his lute. For centuries the Chinese had viewed the  event as scandalous rebellion, but Kuo used it as a theme to  • 17 	asu06600000100021001							64136356 Bytes	3800	5624	2779151458	RGB	8	600	asu06600000100021001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/362	362	363.jp2	/asu0660/image/363.jp2

When the play was  performed in 1923 by the girls of a Normal School, the president of the institution was dismissed and the Board of Education branded the play as obscene.  It was inevitable for the Ibsen revolt to weaken and then to  metamorphose: romanticism and decadence appeared and Oscar  Wilde and Baudelaire became the vogue. But the profoundest  change took place years later when China became Communist.  These days Ibsen is no longer a meddling foreign devil but mere  bourgeois debris floating face down on the wave of the future  alongside Goethe, Beethoven, Wordsworth, Longfellow, Emerson, J. S. Mill. (In this matter an American and British present-  day representative man can easily become brother-in-idea to a  Communist: we must be on alertest guard as to which Western  ideas and works of art we dare not discard in fashionable  changes of curriculum.)  Our next setting of volcanic dramatic eruption is the American South, a movie house in Raleigh showing The Birth of a  Nation in 1915. In the audience sat the dramatist-to-be Paul  Green, who retained vivid memories of an American dramatic  landmark as significant as that of Ghosts:  The lights went down, the orchestra began to play, and  things started to happen .... There on the screen in front  of our eyes not more than twenty yards away we saw brave  armies fighting as only brave ones can. We heard the roar  of cannon, the neighing of horses, saw the bleeding and the  dying, the fluttering flags and banners. And all the while  the thunder and beat of the orchestra whipped our souls  along in the story. Now like a breath the tumult is gone, the  rumble and the cannonading die out and a beautiful woodland vision entrances us. There stands the handsome Little  Colonel and his exquisite southern sweetheart, dove in  hand and all, saying a fond farewell, and the music of the  violin proclaims the piteousness of their love. Then with a  flick the scene has changed again, and we see the dark and  sliding figure of the villain prowling around a vine-clad  cottage, and the evil of his nature is intensified for us in the  croompy notes of the bassoons.

The audience sat one moment  in breathless anxiety, another moment they were applauding the short triumph of virtue and honor. And when at last  the robed and wind-blown figure of the Klansman on his  horse stood in a medium close-up on a hill, and the bugle  in the orchestra announced with its high note that a stern  and powerful force was risen to defend the innocent ones  from all villains of whatsoever creed or color, a frenzy ran  among the spectators like fire among the broomstraw.  There were yells and shouts, clenching of fists, and loud  unashamed oaths. One woman directly in front of me  sprang up as in a religious hysteria and screamed, "Kill  'em, kill 'em!" and then like a lady in a play fell with a  fainting thud to the floor. One of the ushers hurried up and  carried her out, but even as he went he kept looking back  towards the screen . . .  The film as art form and the specific theme and treatment of  this pioneering movie have conquered the earth. To the extent  that The Birth of a Nation is a museum piece and radiates the  remoteness, and forgiveness, of distant historic event for which  living people can no longer be responsible, its influence is conservative and meliorative. Here belong those agreeable aficionados who still inhabit the War in their dreams and in waking  hours wear out brakes stopping at every historical marker. They  are somewhat like remnants of former Browning clubs, Ibsen  discussion groups, Shaw societies, nostalgic Baker Street Irregulars. But to the extent that the spirit and memory of the  movie feed the emotions of the renewed Klan and its fellow  travelers and feed the weird and malignant historical and social distortions of a variety of Black Muslems (who have used  the phrase Rebirth of a Nation) it is sheer dramatic revolt.  With Ibsen and Shaw a major sign of artistic and thematic  success was a disturbed and half-reformed reader putting down  the published play, or an audience leaving the theater either  too moved for chitchat or reanimated with serious discussion  to be carried on at home or at work or even in the halls of  legislature — ideally for the rest of life (the attending farce,  melodrama, and laughter more or less stayed behind in the  • 19 	asu06600000100023001							63797368 Bytes	3788	5612	3470838481	RGB	8	600	asu06600000100023001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/364	364	365.jp2	/asu0660/image/365.jp2

Both authors thought of themselves as planting potent  seeds or extending boundaries to the very limits of human potential.  Compared to the era-marking impact of Ibsen's plays, the  disturbance produced by Hugo's Hernani seems mostly coterie  clamor, and that produced by Hauptmann's Before Dawn mostly repetition, however enhanced, of established dramatic material. We have to come down to the present day for another  truly fundamental dramatic impact, one that even popular journalism has matched with Ghosts for its profoundly stirring and  realigning eects: Rolf Hochhuth's The Deputy (presented on  Broadway in an adaptation that diminishes much of the force  of the original).  The Deputy arouses intense discussion because it probes men's  sense of helplessness in the face of organized brutal sin (committed in the Age of Progress, the Age of Education, the Age of  Science) and in the face of unrealized ideals. History does not  work properly if the goodness and greatness of the earthly representative of Christ and his knowing far-flung Church are subject to conspicuous error of perception and plan, or to error of  indifference more or less permitted and concealed by the  Church's elaborate institutional structure (including its limitless  good works). The very stuff of drama is that of tone-setters (real  or pretended) who do not set the tone, and thus do not live up  to personal, social, inherited, or ordained obligation and potential. The accusing force of The Deputy is not diminished by  peripheral explanation that the Church regarded the Communists as a greater European menace than the Nazis.  With Ibsen's bold surgery (but with very little of his healing  power) Hochhuth lays bare the illusion — the sheer impossibility that "faith and morals" can exist merely as highly selected  tradition, as abstraction, as ritualistic isolation under grand  panoply. And since The Deputy is at work in the midst of the  greatest and most hopeful of all ecumenical movements, it has  true universal impact (paperbacks and movies will soon intensify  this). Protestant Christians stand directly in its uncomfortable  limelight. And by indirection Jews themselves are asked to explain their role in cultural unfolding.

Dramatic Revolt and Conservatism					Selle, Carl																											asu0660000010	door religious sect who ask the puzzled housewife to sign a petition disapproving "that play The Deputy which is against religion."  It is well known that Ibsen puts a heavy burden of self-fulfillment (the antithesis of present-day permissiveness) and of self-  sacrifice, to the point of dismay, dislocation, or even death, on  his bourgeois characters, that he is their scourge and assigner  of doom. This radical aspect of the playwright stimulated those  who were ready and waiting for ideas that struck, with the force  of new genius, at the root of social and human ills. In the case  of Shaw's critical essays, Ibsen aroused a polemic and dialectic  greater than his own (as to a certain extent Wagner did)—  though it was as if the Webbs collaborated with Shaw and as if  he held aside the sheer poetry of playwrighting and the insights  of his own dramatic career. Nobody was more ready and waiting for Ibsen than the feminists, and so arose the idea that he  was the supreme professional champion of the political-economic and social rise of women, an idea that he resolutely refuted.  These reactions to Ibsen, now as staple a part of modern  dramatic criticism as are Bradley, Dowden, and Kittredge in  Shakespearean criticism, overshadow three aspects of the playwright that need to be emphasized in the developments and displacements of present-day society: Ibsen's plays are essentially  a man's world, however deep his understanding and honoring of  women; Ibsen was fundamentally aristocratic (but not in the  spirit of the Almanach de Gotha or of the managerial revolution) and an advocate of noblesse oblige; Ibsen believed in  fostering social stability, in even-keel development among society's tone-setters, in melioration mostly from above. Despite  his financially and socially bankrupt youth, Ibsen was of the  establishment, and felt that he could see into the upper classes  (such as those living at Rosmersholm) and praise and damn  them better than they themselves could. In fact a major part of  the Ibsenian concept and temperament speaks and writes radically but acts conservatively: perhaps a perfect equilibrium in  any democratic society.  What Arnold Hauser says of Shaw holds in considerable part  for Ibsen: "[theatre-goers] were convinced that Shaw's attacks  on bourgeois society were nothing like so dangerous as they  • 21 	asu06600000100027001							63352944 Bytes	3752	5625	336095204	RGB	8	600	asu06600000100027001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/368	368	369.jp2	/asu0660/image/369.jp2

In the end, it turned out that he felt fundamentally  at one with the bourgeoisie, and that he was merely the mouthpiece of that self-criticism that had always been part of the  intellectual make-up of this class." Hauser, who holds that  works of art and literature are quantities best measured—even  though never created—by sociology, here praises more than he  thinks he does.  The conserving, healing, meliorating aspects of the Ibsen  canon are directly expressed in Love's Comedy (boy loses girl to  generous and sensitive businessman); The League of Youth (the  industrialist as giver of stability and graciousness); Pillars of  Society (was ever sinning speculator more quickly forgiven?);  An Enemy of the People (civic virtue robustly triumphs through  vicissitude); The Lady from the Sea (a choice made in freedom  regenerates a marriage); Little Eyolf (through the tragedy of  criminal neglect husband and wife achieve a new goal). And  they are indirectly expressed in a dozen other places. Ibsen as  preserver and eonserver merits as much attention as he arouses  as castigator and doom-giver, particularly in our present time  of upheaval.  22 	asu06600000100028001							63653800 Bytes	3787	5601	1873053651	RGB	8	600	asu06600000100028001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/369	369	370.jp2	/asu0660/image/370.jp2

Contributors to This Issue																																asu0660000010	CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS ISSUE  Marjory Stoneman Douglas, Emeritus Editor of the University of Miami Press, has long followed David O. True's detective  work in seeking certainties about early Western Hemisphere  exploration and map-making. She is currently writing a book  on Florida for the Regions of America Series.  Clark Emery, Professor of English at the University of Miami,  who has published books on the poetry of Ezra Pound, Dylan  Thomas, and William Blake, has recently turned his attention  to English drama. The present essay was chosen from a number  of like studies being readied for publication in book form.  Richard Aldrich taught the history of art at the University of  Miami until his recent retirement. His field trips in Mexican culture were precursors of the University's summer sessions at Oax-  aca, scene of his perceptive pictures of the land and its people.  Carl M. Selle, Associate Professor in the English Department,  last year addressed the Friends of the University of Miami  Library on Ibsen and the White-Collar Hero. He is author of a  volume in the University of Miami Critical Studies: The New  Drama of Jones and Pinero. He is at work on a study of changing  values in modern drama.  Richard L.

The Author's Intention					Bolton, Theodore, b. 1889																											asu0660000004	THE  CARRE LL  Volume 2 DECEMBER 1961 Number 2  THE  AUTHOR'S  INTENTION  By Theodore Bolton  WHENEVER I want a book either for a library or for  my own reading I try to get as nearly as possible  the version of the text that the author intended to  be read. Of course books which have not gone into a second  edition present no problems of selection; but when a book has  gone into two or more printings, textual variations are apt to  arise; and when the book is a classic, the multitudinous printings  may involve a comparison of numerous texts in order to select  the one which the author probably intended to be read.  This is especially true of translations of foreign classics.  Besides a consideration of the original texts, there is also a  comparison to be made of the translations with the original  texts, and with each other before one finds a reliable translation;  all of which takes time.  It was years, for example, before I found a translation of Don  Quixote that was accurate. This was the translation by Samuel  Putnam that appeared in 1949. It is readable as well as accurate.  Most of the earlier translations resemble that by Peter Motteaux  as to the opening sentence. Motteaux's translation begins:  At a certain village in La Mancha which I shall  not name there lived not long ago one of those  gentlemen who always have a lance in the rack.  Compare this colorless translation with that by Samuel  Putnam, which reads: 	asu06600000040003001							69178432 Bytes	3950	5836	1156269541	RGB	8	600	asu06600000040003001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/377	377	378.jp2	/asu0660/image/378.jp2
The Author's Intention					Bolton, Theodore, b. 1889																											asu0660000004	In a village of La Mancha the name of which I  have no desire to recall, there lived not so long  ago one of those old-fashioned gentlemen who  always have a lance in the rack.  The last sentence leaps immediately to life. Cervantes did  not simply allude to a village which "I shall not name," but to  a dreadful little place which he had "no desire to recall." The  comparison shows all the difference between the nearly-right  expression and the right expression. By such accurate translations of even the smaller passages, Putnam illuminates his  pages and makes his work a pleasure to read. There is no  question but that Putnam's version of Don Quixote is the  desirable one for a library.  Another foreign classic of which there are numerous translations is the autobiography, or Memoirs of Benvenuto Cellini.  The translation by John Addington Symonds has gone through  many editions, but this is more of an elegant paraphrase of the  original text than an accurate version of it. The only unpara-  phrased and unexpurgated translation is that of R. H. H. Cust,  which is illustrated with plates after the master's work, and  supplied with annotations.  Cust, to use his own words, tried:  ... to demonstrate the theory that the force and  vividness of the original narrative are heightened  rather than diminished by the wild confusion of  detailed thought in the thread of it, by the very  inconsequence of the sentences as regards one  another, and by the utterly unstudied rattle of  the narrator, as he pours out his reminiscences  pile-mile.  The reason for the wild confusion of the words was due to  the fact that Cellini, the favorite of kings, princes, popes, and  cardinals, was such a busy man that he dictated the story of his  life to a lad "about fourteen years of age," after starting it  himself. He gave up his own writing of it as an "unreasonable  waste" of time, as he explained to his friend, the "most Magnificent and most Excellent" Benedetto Varchi, to whom he  dedicated his memoirs. 	asu06600000040004001							71339764 Bytes	4045	5877	4028131542	RGB	8	600	asu06600000040004001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/378	378	379.jp2	/asu0660/image/379.jp2
The Author's Intention					Bolton, Theodore, b. 1889																											asu0660000004	As an example of Cust's presentation of the memoirs, I take  his rendering of Cellini's words on the subject of the bronze  bust of Bindo d'Antonio Altoviti. In 1552, while Cellini was  at work on his statue of Persius for Duke Cosimo, he gained  permission to go to Rome where he wished to see Altoviti,  whose bronze bust he had made. To gain permission, Cellini  showed the Duke a letter he had received from Michelagniolo,  or Michelangelo as his name is generally spelled. The occasion  for the letter was this: one day while Altoviti was standing at  his doorway, "Michelagniolo Buonaroti the sculptor happened  to be passing by." Altoviti invited the sculptor to enter and see  his study, which Michelangelo did. When he saw the bronze  bust he said:  Who is this master who has portrayed you so  well? Know that that head pleases me as much  and somewhat more than do those antiques . . .  Then, still quoting from memory, Cellini declares that  Michelangelo, "directly" after he had left the house, wrote him:  Benvenuto mine! I have known you for many  years as the greatest goldsmith regarding whom  we have ever had any information; and now I  shall recognize you to be a sculptor of similar  (renown). Know that Messer Bindo Altoviti  took me to see a portrait head of himself in  bronze, and told me it was your handiwork. I  received much pleasure from it. But I took it  very ill that it was placed in a bad light, for if it  had been in its proper light it would show what a  fine work it is.  Cust does not stop here. He adds text and context to illuminate  the passage. He adds in a foot-note a translation of the text of  Michelangelo's letter, which says little more than that Michelangelo saw the bust, liked it, and thought it placed in a bad light;  and by way of context, Cust adds a reproduction of the bust  of Altoviti, now in the Gardner collection at Boston. In this  wise the reader is confirmed in his suspicion that Cellini was  a grand braggart as well as a great artist; and, supplied with a  picture of the bust, the reader may also make up his own 	asu06600000040005001							70058356 Bytes	4014	5816	1374188695	RGB	8	600	asu06600000040005001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/379	379	380.jp2	/asu0660/image/380.jp2
The Author's Intention					Bolton, Theodore, b. 1889																											asu0660000004	mind as to its merits, instead of relying on Cellini's high  estimate of his abilities.  Turning from translations to English books, here again the  selection of a reliable text is a matter of comparison. It may  sound like a heretic notion but it is nevertheless true that the  first edition of a book is not always the desirable book for  reading; nor, for that matter, is the latest edition.  Before me as I write, I have a copy of the first edition of  Shaw's Widowers* Houses. Looking at it, I can say: "This is  exactly the form in which the author did not wish his play to be  read." The history of the play is not difficult to trace. The  manuscript is in two note books, one larger than the other, in  the Berg Collection at the New York Public Library. On the  first page of the larger book, which is a ninety-two page manuscript written in ink, Shaw notes: "First two acts written in  1885. First part of 3rd act probably in 1890. Second part  in 1892 — Finished 1st August, pp. 83, 84, 85, added  20/10/92." The other is a small pocket book with the manuscript written in blue pencil.  Shaw started the play in collaboration with William Archer,  who tells the story of the joint venture into the preface to the  first edition. Alluding to Shaw, Archer writes that: "Construction he owned was not his strong point but his dialogue was  incomparable." As to his own merits, Archer declares: "I could  not write dialogue a bit; but I considered myself a born  constructor."  So Archer constructed a plot with two heroines for a play  entitled Rhinegold, vaguely suggested by Augier's Ceinture  Doree, for Shaw to work on. After about six weeks, Shaw read  to Archer some notes for a play with one heroine, and said:  "I've used up all your plot."  The upshot was that Archer withdrew from the collaboration,  and Shaw laid the play aside, until 1892, when he finished it;  entitled it Widowers' Houses; and turned it over to J. T. Grein,  "founder and sole proprietor" of the Independent Theatre  Society. It was produced by the Society at the Royalty Theatre  on the 9th of December, 1892, and repeated on the 12th of  the same month.  The play was a "sensation," and the text was published for  • 4 	asu06600000040006001							71461704 Bytes	4072	5848	3282098751	RGB	8	600	asu06600000040006001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/380	380	381.jp2	/asu0660/image/381.jp2
The Author's Intention					Bolton, Theodore, b. 1889																											asu0660000004	Grein by Henry and Company, in 1893, with an introduction  by Grein, an author's preface including Archer's account of  the collaboration, and two appendices by the author. Only the  supplementary material published with the text has value. As  for the text itself, of this, the first edition of Widowers' Houses,  Shaw writes elsewhere:  The volume forming volume number one of the  Independent Theatre series of plays is still extant,  a curious relic of that nine days wonder; and as it  contains the original text of the play with all its  silly pleasantries, I can recommend it to collectors of quarto Hamlets, and of all those scarce  and superceded early editions which the unfortunate author would so gladly annihilate if he  could.  The quotation is from the first of Shaw's two-volume Plays,  Pleasant and Unpleasant, published in 1898, both in London  and Chicago. The first of these volumes contains the second  version of Widowers' Houses, and the first published versions  of his six other plays. Addressing himself to the play-reading  as well as to the play-going public, Shaw made the dialogue  more readable and understandable by adding descriptions of  the scenes, directions for the actors, and character sketches of  all the dramatis personae.  There is a note of Shaw at work on his transformation of  his plays. Grant Richards, the English publisher, in his Author  Hunting, prints a letter from Shaw, dated August 27, 1897,  Argoed, Monmouthshire, in which Shaw reports that he has  "transmogrified" his plays "beyond recognition" and made them  "more thrilling than any novel."  Beginning with these plays, Shaw created a "new art," combining the novelist's skill with that of the dramatist, which has  widely influenced play publication. Obviously, it is in the  "transmogrified" form "more thrilling than a novel," and not  in the form used in the first edition of Widowers' Houses, that  Shaw wished the play to be read.  Another first edition superceded by a later edition is the  first edition of Great Expectations by Charles Dickens, which 	asu06600000040007001							68175496 Bytes	3927	5785	1737390203	RGB	8	600	asu06600000040007001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/381	381	382.jp2	/asu0660/image/382.jp2
The Author's Intention					Bolton, Theodore, b. 1889																											asu0660000004	appeared serially in All the Year Round, beginning with the  December 1860 issue. The first edition appeared in 1861.  Bulwer Lytton, who read the proof sheets of the last installment,  was fascinated with the story, except for the last chapter in  which the hero and heroine were separated. He urged Dickens  to change the last chapter and unite the couple, which Dickens  did.  With the case stated, the question now arises: which of the  two last chapters represents the text as Dickens intended it to  be read? Although the second ending appears in the first edition  of the novel, versions of the deleted first ending exist.  The most readily available text of the original last chapter  was published by John Forster in his Life of Charles Dickens,  issued in 1874. A recent text of the novel, published by The  Limited Editions Club, incorporates the original last chapter.  A note reads:  This edition of Great Expectations reprints the  novel by Charles Dickens with the ending which  he originally wrote and which has not previously  appeared in book form.  This presentation includes a long introduction by Bernard  Shaw. I examined Shaw's copy of the book last October when  I was on a visit to Shaw's Corner, at Ayot Saint Lawrence. In  this essay Shaw gives a very convincing argument for accepting  the ending which Dickens originally wrote as the one which  the author probably wished to be read, despite his last-moment  revision to suit Bulwer Lytton.  Before presenting the two endings it is well to survey the  story in order to give them their context. The story tells of a  village boy named Pip who dreams of rising above his station  as blacksmith's apprentice to that of being a gentleman. His  dreams come true when he is supplied with wealth from an  unknown source.  His expectations are shattered when he learns that his financial  support has come from a convict he had once fed. The convict  is deported, but finally escapes from the penal colony and  returns to England where he dies in prison. His wealth, and  Pip's source of support, is forfeited to the Crown.  Pip's expectations have been fostered by a Miss Havisham 	asu06600000040008001							71374644 Bytes	4069	5844	43373479	RGB	8	600	asu06600000040008001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/382	382	383.jp2	/asu0660/image/383.jp2
The Author's Intention					Bolton, Theodore, b. 1889																											asu0660000004	who, jilted in youth, plans to revenge herself on men. As an  instrument of her revenge, she has taught a beautiful girl named  Estella to use her beauty to torture her admirers. Pip is her  victim. She torments him by her coldness. After Miss Havisham's  death and the convict's return, Pip and Estella, both disillusioned, are separated. Eight years later they meet, and join hands,  never to part again, according to the rewritten ending. The  last sentence in the first edition reads:  I took her hand in mine and we went out of the  ruined place; and, as the morning mists had risen  long ago when I first left the forge, so the evening  mists were rising now, and in all the broad  expanse of tranquil light they showed me, I saw  no shadow of another parting from her.  The rewritten chapter, which includes this sentence, Dickens  sent to Forster with a note informing him:  You will be surprized to hear that I have changed  the end of Great Expectations. Bulwer strongly  urged it upon me, after reading the proofs, and  supported his views with such good reasons that  I resolved to make the change.  Forster carried out the author's wishes, but he preferred  the chapter as it was originally written, and fortunately saved  the manuscript. When he came to writing the Life of Charles  Dickens, published in three volumes, the last in 1874, he quotes  from the letter just noted, and presents most if not all of the  last chapter as it was originally written, with the comment that:  "the first ending seems to be more consistent with the drift,  as well as with the natural working out of the tale . . ."  The "first ending," or original version, in which Pip visits  the old forge where he was once an apprentice, are all that  are retained in the rewritten version, except that the visit takes  place eleven years after Pip's great expectations are shattered,  whereas only eight have elapsed in the substituted version.  In both versions, then, Pip visits the old forge and talks to  Biddy, the blacksmith's second wife. Alluding to Estella, Biddy  asks Pip: "You are sure and certain that you don't fret for her?" 	asu06600000040009001							68684204 Bytes	3942	5806	2962138625	RGB	8	600	asu06600000040009001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/383	383	384.jp2	/asu0660/image/384.jp2
The Author's Intention					Bolton, Theodore, b. 1889																											asu0660000004	From here on the two versions differ. In the original version,  Pip's answer is clear: "I am sure and certain."  The scene then changes to London where Pip and his  namesake, little Pip, are on a visit. Pip tells the story of the  visit. It was two years before he saw her himself. But he had  heard of Estella's life. She had married unhappily. Her husband  had died. She married again. Her second husband was a country  doctor, and the couple lived in straitened circumstances. In  Pip's own words:  I was in England again—in London and walking  along Piccadilly with little Pip—when a servant  came running after me to ask if I would step back  to a lady in a carriage who wished to speak to  me. It was a little pony carriage, which the lady  was driving; and the lady and I looked sadly  enough at one another. "I am greatly changed,  I know, but I thought that you would like to  shake hands with Estella too, Pip. Lift up that  pretty child and let me kiss it." (She supposed  the child, I think, to be my child.) I was very  glad afterwards to have had the interview; for  in her face and in her voice, and in her touch,  she gave me the assurance that her suffering had  been stronger than Miss Havisham's teaching,  and had given her a heart to understand what my  heart used to be.  There is every reason to believe with Shaw that Estella and  Pip never met again. As Forster writes in the sentence already  quoted, the first ending "seems more consistent with the drift  as well as with the natural working out of the tale." The  development of the story shows the disillusionment of the two  characters, and the ending should not be the artificial denouement which Dickens wrote for Bulwer Lytton.  The book published by the Limited Editions Club is not  easily accessible, nor is the ending published in The Clarion for  May 16, 1922. But the reader will find most if not all of the  first version in the life of Dickens by his friend Forster.

Known and produced as a three-  act play, the first version was in four acts. A history of the  manuscript after and before the printing of the first edition  will show what happened.  Immediately following his release from prison, Wilde settled  in France, in 1897. In 1899, a year before his death, he  published the three-act acting version of The Importance of  Being Earnest. The text of this first edition is the one generally  performed. Yet, in 1903, Hermann Freiherr von Tschenberg  published his German version, and this is in four acts.  Wilde wrote the play in four acts, beginning in the summer  of 1894 and finishing by the end of January 1895. He deposited  it for copyright as "Lady Lansing," calling it a four-act play,  although the play deposited was in three acts.  What happened was this: after the failure of the play Guy  Domville, by Henry James, the actor-manager George Alexander, eager to recoup his losses on this production, obtained The  Importance of Being Earnest from Wilde. However, Alexander  insisted that the play be shortened to three acts, which Wilde  very reluctantly did. It was first performed at St. James' Theatre  on February 14,  1895.  The discarded act was lost sight of for many years. Within  recent years the late George Arents discovered it, bought it,  and published it in facsimile with the rest of the manuscript,  and with a printed version of the entire play. The title-page of  this edition is: The Importance of Being Earnest, A Trivial  Comedy for Serious People, in Four Acts as Originally Written.  It is for sale at the New York Public Lbrary where the manuscript of the play is deposited with the rest of the Arents  Collection. This famous play has never been produced in its  entirety.  These are just a few of the books which have interested me;  but I am not so much concerned in calling attention to them as  in showing the comparative method for selecting books. If  the reader wishes to gain full enjoyment of a work so popular  as to appear in more than one edition, he will find that trying  to determine just what version of a work the author wished,  or might have wished, to be read, is not a very difficult procedure, and the result may be highly rewarding. 	asu06600000040011001							67827676 Bytes	3909	5782	4029388580	RGB	8	600	asu06600000040011001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/385	385	386.jp2	/asu0660/image/386.jp2
As I See Blake					Auslander, Joseph, 1897-1965																											asu0660000004	r  AS I SEE BLAKE  By Joseph Auslander  'What', it will be questioned,  'when the sun rises, do you not  see a round disc of fire somewhat like a guinea?' 'O no, no,  I see an innumerable company  of the heavenly host crying  "Holy, Holy Holy is the Lord  God Almighty"'  William Blake  It takes the world a long time to catch up with its prophets.  As a rule, we stone our prophets first, then put the stones —  with the proper ritual of canonization — in a glass cabinet.  In this way our museums keep pace with our martyrs.  One of these martyrs was a man named William Blake. He  happened to be a poet and an artist. He was not a professional  prophet. He did not make a business of stretching conjecture to  the proportions of prophecy. In fact, he predicted nothing.  But he said things. And he shocked people. And he mystified  people. He still does. For example, he was devoted to the woman  he married. She was devoted to him. Also, they were happy. Also,  they disported themselves in their garden in entire and blissful  nakedness. All of which was bad enough.  To make matters worse, William Blake loved our common  humanity with an uncommon love. He loved the poor, the oppressed. He even loved the rich. His heart went out to little  creatures and large, to lambs and tigers, to mosses and moon-  soons. They all had something to say to him. And he had songs  for all of them: Songs of Innocence, Songs of Experience —  artless, wild, strange, perplexing in their simplicity, terribly beautiful and immediate and moving as the talk of children or the  language of lions and tempests and meadowlarks and lilies can  be to those of us who listen with open hearts.  Essentially a child, William Blake not only entered the Kingdom of Heaven; he was the Kingdom. It dwelt within him. He  • 10 	asu06600000040012001							69819952 Bytes	4005	5808	1429658632	RGB	8	600	asu06600000040012001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/386	386	387.jp2	/asu0660/image/387.jp2
As I See Blake					Auslander, Joseph, 1897-1965																											asu0660000004	lived in it constantly, casually as a child does without thinking  about it one way or another. He took it for granted. To tell the  truth, he gave it little thought. He made no fuss about it because  it was of him and in him, not something foreign and difficult  outside of him.  As a child, therefore, he saw things the way a child sees things  — horizontally. He looked at the world of nature and the so-  called supernatural unclouded by witnesses: fresh with the pristine and provident dew of the first morning of time upon them.  There was nothing between the seeing and the knowing. What  he saw he became and it became him.  Poets have always done that more or less. Children always  do that. Every child is a natural and inevitable poet — that is,  until we educate that kind of lovely pure looking at things out  of him; until we teach him to search out meanings instead of  letting him be the meaning.  So William Blake would go for a walk in the rain and come  back all excited and out of breath with the wonder and glory  of what he had seen. He had seen a tree full of angels not so  far away from the house. He had touched the sky with his stick.  Or Moses or Mahomet would sit for him to be painted. Or he  would hobnob on the most familiar footing with Paul or with  Hyperion.  He knew the truth without needing to name it anything  important or setting it apart and above other things. He realized  instinctively that the days which make us happy make us wise.  Therefore, being wise, he was simple — so that the dusty  pedant might read profound folderol into his words and works.  Therefore, being happy, he was marvelously mad — so that the  miserable world of grownups might vent their envy and their  spleen upon him.  Someday that world may catch up with William Blake. But  there will be a few more martyrs stoned before that day comes  to pass.  11 	asu06600000040013001							69589004 Bytes	3968	5844	3304177028	RGB	8	600	asu06600000040013001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/387	387	388.jp2	/asu0660/image/388.jp2

Dr. Mark F. Boyd and Florida Historical Writing					Tebeau, Charlton W.																											asu0660000004	DR. MARK F. BOYD and  FLORIDA HISTORICAL WRITING  By Charlton W. Tebeau  IN SPITE of a generation of increasingly intensified activity  by gifted amateurs and professional writers, the history of  Florida remains largely unwritten. For example, the only  college level textbook, Dr. Kathryn Abbey Hanna's Florida  Land of Change, (Chapel Hill, University of North Carolina  Press), published in 1941 and reprinted in 1948 with added  chapters, is now several years out of print. Much needed spade  work has since been done and must be included in any new  synthesis.  Dr. J. E. Dovell in the first two volumes of Florida; Historic,  Dramatic, Contemporary (New York, Lewis Historical Publishing Company, 1952) assembled most of the material then in  print, but failed to produce an integrated narrative. Further,  these volumes were part of a four volume set and had limited  circulation. Also, even more in the way of local and special  studies remains to be done before any completely adequate general history can be written.  In the forefront of those who have contributed to this growing  knowledge of Florida's past is Dr. Mark F. Boyd of Tallahassee.  His great collection of books, prints and maps, which was the  basis for his own historical studies, is now a part of the University of Miami Library. Contracted for a dozen years ago, the  library took possession two years ago, and it is now catalogued  and available for use. These nearly eight thousand volumes,  with a high percentage of primary sources, certainly provide  incentive as well as a means for continuing study, and the  nucleus for an even greater collection of the materials of Florida history.  His own researches and writings are no less important. This  is not to suggest that they are based exclusively on his own  library. Though his is one of the most important in the state, no  single collection is ever self-sufficient. The State Library in the  Supreme Court Building in Tallahassee, as one might reasonably  expect, has the greatest number of public documents.

Yonge Library of Florida History at the  University of Florida at Gainesville. Nor is this to minimize the  importance of the library of the Florida Historical Society, also  housed at the University of Florida, of the St. Augustine Historical Society, and of collections in major academic institutions  and other private collections only less extensive.  Dr. Boyd's writings are notable for the volume and range of  subject matter. This is the more remarkable since he is not a  professional historian. Florida history is an avocation which  became an increasingly absorbing interest to which he devoted  all of his time after he retired. Few, if any, of its professional  historians have found time to write as much. Aside from his  book length writing, only the late T. Frederick Davis of Jacksonville and Julien C. Yonge of Pensacola, editor of the Florida  Historical Quarterly from 1924 to 1955, have written anywhere  near as much for the Quarterly.  Dr. Boyd is by profession a malariologist who won distinction  in research in the malarial regions of the western hemisphere  sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation. He is a past president  of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and the first  American to receive the Prix Emile Brumpt for research in  tropical medicine. The books and records accumulated in this  work are now a part of the library of the University of Miami  School of Medicine. This has added importance because of current interest in public health and medicine in tropical areas  shared by social scientists.  Out of this professional experience involving extensive travel  came the interest in the history of the western hemisphere and  the collecting of materials on the age of exploration, discovery  and early settlement with special attention to Florida and nearby  related areas. With this interest and with these resources at hand,  it was but natural that he turn to writing the history of Florida.  His training and work as a scientist made him as meticulously  careful a researcher in his historical studies. The result has been  soundly based and carefully reasoned historical conclusions.  Nor is his scientific interest limited to medicine. Among the  papers is a large number of miscellaneous reports on subjects  related to public health in Florida where he has served on the  State Board of Health.

They have explored, examined,  described and sometimes catalogued the natural wonders of the  biological heritage and pointed out the use man has made of this  natural wealth. They have been among the first to express alarm  that the march of civilization and heedless use of these treasures  might soon destroy them. It is no surprise to find here the writings of such notables as Clarence B. Moore, John Kunkel Small,  Charles Torrey Simpson and John C. Gifford.  When he teamed with archaeologist John W. Griffin and  anthropologist Hale G. Smith to write Here They Once Stood;  The Tragic End of The Apalachee Missions, (Gainesville, University of Florida Press, 1951), a study of Spanish Missions in  Florida and Georgia, Dr. Boyd provided an important object  lesson for other local and state historians. For only such a team  can hope to put together a satisfactory account of activities of  the Indians and the whites of that early day. From the last three  decades of the sixteenth century to the end of the seventeenth  the Franciscans strove valiantly to win the souls and the allegiance of the Indians. They established a chain of missions west  of St. Augustine to Tallahassee and for a time to the Apalachi-  cola River and northward from the same base up the Georgia  Coast. But they met complete and final defeat in 1702 at the  hands of Colonel James Moore and his Indian allies from Carolina. (See Charles W. Arnade, The Siege of St. Augustine in  1702, Gainesville, University of Florida Press, 1959.)  Important as this study is, it serves best to tell us how little  we know of Florida's aboriginal Indians. The Spaniards found  an estimated 25,000 of them here early in the sixteenth century.  By the end of the eighteenth century they were all gone, leaving  precious little historical record and less physical remains than  might be expected. Without stone or metal in any quantity, they  relied upon bone, shell, and perishable vegetable fibers for tools,  weapons, household furnishings, ornaments and building  material. They died in tribal wars, or fighting white interlopers,  or of European introduced diseases, or had been carried off to  Carolina by the English except for a small remnant that accompanied the departing Spaniards in 1763. This displacement of  these first inhabitants is a remarkable story yet to be told and  • 15 	asu06600000040021001							70412744 Bytes	4004	5860	2598323225	RGB	8	600	asu06600000040021001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/395	395	396.jp2	/asu0660/image/396.jp2
Dr. Mark F. Boyd and Florida Historical Writing					Tebeau, Charlton W.																											asu0660000004	will require all of the historical and archaeological resources  we can command.  Historical sources now available provide only the scantiest  accounts of these Indians and their way of life. The result is too  much reliance upon such overworked sources as Fontaneda and  Jonathan Dickinson. The Stetson collection in the P. K. Yonge  Library contains photostatic copies of some 50,000 documents  from Spanish archives, most of which have not yet been translated. There must be even more abundant record in the Spanish  archives, possibly in the new world, more likely in Spain. But  this may be a wrong assumption.  Florida, after the first fever of excitement over its discovery  and exploration had died down, proved very disappointing to  Spaniards spoiled by richer discoveries in Mexico, Central and  South America. Florida was thereafter only a military outpost,  maintained in a niggardly fashion for the protection of the more  precious domain to the South. Being a constant drain on the  treasury tended to downgrade Florida in the minds of most  officials who might have written it off as a nuisance, however  necessary to maintain.  Further interest in archaeology is reflected in the monograph:  "Historic sites in and around the Jim Woodruff Reservoir Area,  Florida-Georgia." River Basin Surveys Papers, No. 13, (Bureau  of American Ethnology, Bulletin, 1958.) This was a project in  which the Florida Historical Society and the National Park  Service cooperated, Dr. Boyd doing the research and writing.  It is a study of the historical aspects of fourteen Indian occupation sites four of which were to be inundated behind the dam.  All of the historical records, were they available, could tell  us only what discoverers and explorers observed at the time of  their coming, and of events during the four and a half centuries  since discovery. Only the archaeologist and the anthropologist  can tell us anything of their history before that time. And these  sciences are more recently and less fully developed for Florida  than the historical studies.  This task is also made more difficult by the paucity of the  written record which serves admirably as a starting point of  investigation. The greater part of it is written in the Spanish of  the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and requires special skill  • 16 	asu06600000040022001							68961460 Bytes	3979	5774	2837033747	RGB	8	600	asu06600000040022001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/396	396	397.jp2	/asu0660/image/397.jp2

Most students, even the professional ones, lack both  requisites. In recent years students and researchers at Rollins  College, The University of Florida, Florida State University, the  Central Florida Museum at Orlando and the Florida State  Museum at Gainesville have greatly advanced these studies. The  Florida Anthropological Society encourages and assists and publishes much of the results in The Florida Anthropologist. Local  chapters, usually affiliated with the state organization, participate  enthusiastically if not always wisely in "digging up Florida's Past."  This is another case of too little too late, but makes all the  more important the collection and investigation that have been  accomplished. The amateur and the professional are losing to  bull dozers and draglines everywhere.  The Florida landscape is being reshaped for building homes  and roads and water control projects, and the physical remains,  the only record in most instances, are being obliterated. Many of  the perpetrators of these deeds of destruction are mindful of the  importance of the artifacts they unearth or inundate, and willing  enough that they be salvaged under conditions that make them  useful to those who can thereby reconstruct the conditions of life  centuries ago. The State Road Department has at times provided  tools and labor for digging on the right of way, but there are not  enough trained people available to direct the work. Progress  cannot wait for archaeology and history. Destruction and construction are going on in too many places.  The Boyd collection like Florida's history has a distinctly international flavor. England, France and Spain have been involved.  The French element is limited but there is a heavy sprinkling of  Spanish titles and many English ones.  The English raided and traded in Florida almost from the  beginning, if, indeed, the Cabots did not discover it. But they  actually held and governed Florida for only a period of twenty  years, 1763-1783. Yet they left an indelible impress upon its  development which the nearly four decades of the second Spanish occupation could not erase. By making Florida an extension  of the colonial system developed in the other English-American  colonies, they prepared the way for eventual American occupation.

But  thereafter the region was only nominally Spanish.  The British, as had their Spanish predecessors, spent most of  their efforts in the northern part of the territory but encouraged  exploration and reports on the new land, some of which were  published. We find here the works of John and William Bartram,  Bernard Romans, Charles Vignoles, and typescript of the unpublished W. G. de Brahms report.  Dr. Boyd's other writing on the Spanish period centers mostly  in the Apalachee region where Tallahassee is located and of  which St. Marks was the Spanish center, but it is in no wise  limited to it. The greater part of it appears as articles in the  Florida Historical Quarterly over a period of years. In manuscript  at this writing is a book length biography of Juan Joseph Elegio  de la Puente, a prominent figure in Spanish St. Augustine.  Numerous documents and some writing attest the interest in  the Seminoles. The entire Number 3 of Vol. XXX of Florida  Historical Quarterly is devoted to The Seminole War: Its Background and Onset. This begins with a brief explanation of the  coming of the Seminoles to Florida after the departure of the  aboriginal Indians. There follows an account of the effort to  remove them, and their resistance which provoked this Florida  chapter of the wars of Indian removal which fill so many pages  of American history. Closely related to this is Dr. Boyd's contribution to a symposium on the noted Seminole, Osceola, which  fills a double number of the Florida Historical Quarterly, (Vol.  XXXIII, January-April, 1955.)  This wide-ranging historian also produced a series of articles  dealing with the American Civil War in Florida which appeared  in the several numbers of Volume XXIX of the Florida Historical  Quarterly. Of special importance is the account of the battle at  Olustee in 1864, Florida's most important single military operation, which is commemorated at Olustee State Park where the  action is described and interpreted. Perhaps the most dramatic  military engagement in Florida was the repulse of the Union  invaders at Natural Bridge late in the war, which left Tallahassee  the only unconquered Confederate State Capital.

Boyd and Florida Historical Writing					Tebeau, Charlton W.																											asu0660000004	are the Battle of Mariana and joint operations of the Federal  Army and Navy near St. Marks.  The years immediately following the Civil War and Reconstruction witnessed an all-out effort to attract visitors, settlers  and capital to the undeveloped state where population did not  reach the half million mark until the turn of the century. Like  her sister southern states, Florida had an immigration commissioner with a small advertising budget. Railroad companies that  had received large grants of public land to subsidize their building operations wished to sell land and attract customers. The  Boyd Library contains an excellent selection of the books published as a part of this effort to describe what the state had to  offer. Among the writers was no less a personage than Sidney  Lanier whose Florida, Its Scenery, Climate and History, A Complete Handbook, was published in Philadelphia by Lippincott  in 1876, commissioned by the Atlantic Coast Line Railway. Lanier made several excursions from Jacksonville through the state  seeking information for what was really a guide book, and included a chapter on consumptives, calling attention to the area's  virtues as a health resort. Another example of the better books  of this sort is George M. Barbour, Florida for Tourists, Invalids,  and Settlers, New York, 1882.  The materials of Florida History are widely scattered. Collectors from other states like J. G. De Roulhac Hamilton of North  Carolina came into the State before many of our own people  were alerted to their importance, and carried historical materials  away to enrich the historical resources of other institutions. We  may wish we had them here, but we can be glad someone had  the foresight and initiative to gather up and preserve them. We  owe a special debt of gratitude to Mark F. Boyd and the others  who have made such a splendid beginning to assemble the library  resources for continuing study of the State's history.  Educational institutions, historical societies and libraries are  now prepared to receive, preserve and make available to researchers all materials that come their way. Nor should it be  overlooked that contributors of one document are as important  in their way as are the gatherers of great libraries which provide  the all important nucleus for establishing historical studies on a  broad and sound basis.  • 19 	asu06600000040025001							70138444 Bytes	4011	5827	3813728093	RGB	8	600	asu06600000040025001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/399	399	400.jp2	/asu0660/image/400.jp2
Accent on Area and Maker in University Map Collecting					Morgan, Charles L., Jr.																											asu0660000004	accent on area and maker in  university map collecting  By Charles L. Morgan, Jr.  THE LATE N. B. T. RONEY adopted as a hobby (late  in life) the collecting of maps of Florida and the  adjacent areas. His activity resulted in a very interesting  collection of maps and charts from the sixteenth to the nineteenth  centuries of the part of the world which is now Florida, the  Southeastern U.S.A. and the Caribbean Sea. His bequest of this  collection to the University of Miami Library has been a fruitful  seed from which has grown a quite large and potentially useful  collection of maps of the area which awaits only cataloguing and  description to be a useful adjunct to the Boyd and other  collections of the University of Miami Library in the investigation of Florida history.  Mr. Roney's attitude toward his collection was that of an  intelligent and interested amateur. He bought maps of the area  in which he was interested as they came on the market and as  they fitted in with what he wanted in the way of an historical  cartography of Florida. His hobby resulted in an extremely  valuable collection as it came to the University at his death.  As a result of what I can only consider extreme good luck,  the Roney Collection has been augmented by other related  collections which have added to without much duplicating the  original collection. Some of these have been purchased. Others  have been gifts.  Because we recognized the importance of the Roney Collection as an adjunct to the Boyd Collection and other materials  in our Library for the study of Florida history, we in the  Acquisitions Department have tried to buy supplementary maps  as they have appeared in dealers' catalogs. These efforts have  resulted in some useful additions to our collections.  However, the one most important group of additions to the  University map collections came from the efforts of the late  Louis C. Karpinski. Dr. Karpinski, when he retired from the  University of Michigan to his home in Winter Haven, intended  • 20 	asu06600000040026001							69398100 Bytes	3983	5806	3310738834	RGB	8	600	asu06600000040026001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/400	400	401.jp2	/asu0660/image/401.jp2
Accent on Area and Maker in University Map Collecting					Morgan, Charles L., Jr.																											asu0660000004	no doubt to spend his last years in green and quiet retirement.  It was beyond his ability. He had to have some outlet for his  benevolence and for his obsession with the literary market place.  He adopted collecting as his hobby and the University of Miami  as his beneficiary. The result of his junkets through the Southeast  and the Caribbean was an additional group of maps (and books)  pertaining to the Florida area which complemented and expanded  both the Boyd and the Roney Collections. It was impossible to  keep tab on Dr. Karpinski. When the Library station wagon was  filled with maps and books at the end of one of our semi-annual  trips to his home in Winter Haven, he would appear with his  arms loaded with rolls of maps and say: "You really should  have these, too," and toss them on top of the already full  back end.  Other gifts have added much to the collections. Maps in the  Tanner Collection, while not predominantly relating to the  Florida or Caribbean area, do include a manuscript map of  Lake Okeechobee drawn by Capt. E. Backus in 1838, and  several small memorandum books of the same period, two of  whose illustrative sketches are reproduced in this Carrell. Also  of interest to the student of the Caribbean area is the Sanson  d'Abbeville Atlas Nouveau Contenant Toutes les Parties du  Monde (Paris, 1696), perhaps the most beautiful of the atlases  in Mr. Tanner's collection.  The gift of the Library of Mr. Phanor J. Eder, although it  was not strong in maps as such, was very strong in books in  which maps played an important part. The Eder family has  been most interested in Colombia and Colombian history, but  inevitably things Colombian become things Caribbean and things  Caribbean impinge on Florida (especially in the eighteenth  century and the early part of the nineteenth) and the result shows  an almost uncanny dovetailing with the Boyd and Tanner  Collections.  The present result of all this luck, the outcome of this  generosity, is a group of maps which must eventually be of  inestimable value to students of Florida history; a group of  maps uncatalogued, unlisted, but carefully preserved, thoughtfully collected and (we hope) thoughtfully augmented with  consideration of their eventual use by qualified students of  Florida history.  • 21 	asu06600000040027001							71003144 Bytes	4023	5880	964718755	RGB	8	600	asu06600000040027001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/401	401	402.jp2	/asu0660/image/402.jp2
Accent on Area and Maker in University Map Collecting					Morgan, Charles L., Jr.																											asu0660000004	Since the collecting of Florida maps involves almost automatically the collecting of maps of the surrounding area, we  have bought and have had given us many maps and atlases of  the Caribbean and the Spanish Main. The Thomas Jefferys  West-India Atlas is a superb example of 18th century cartography.  The Portugaliae Monumenta Cartographica is an excellent  object lesson of what contemporary organizations and governments can do to preserve the efforts of their earlier compatriots.  The Portuguese government is certainly to be congratulated  upon this.  One special contribution to our map collection is that of the  facsimile collection of Mr. David O. True. Mr. True, who has  been for many years a student of Florida and in general of early  North American cartography, has given to the University Library  the Collection he has built through many years of photostat  reproductions of maps of this area from the very earliest  through the early 18th century. These reproductions, including  many enlargements, were obtained from museums and libraries  in Spain, Portugal, Italy and France, and will be useful to  other scholars as they have been to Mr. True himself.  In order to provide a focus, we have decided that in our  buying to supplement our very handsome gifts, we should decide  upon, first, a particular mapmaker or two, and, second, on one  non-Florida locale on which to concentrate what money we  are able to allocate for this purpose.  For the place, we have chosen Northern South America  (especially Colombia) and for the makers, Tomas Jefferys and  the Dutch family of Van der Aa (especially Pierre or Pieter  Van der Aa). We have had some success in pursuing both  these trails, but as yet we have not been able to purchase as  much in either line as we have had given us by the Roney and  the Tanner and Eder Collections and by the magnificent and  wise and generous eccentricity of Dr. Karpinski.  Our map collection has reached the point where it would be  dangerous to continue buying indiscriminately until the maps  we already have are adequately described and catalogued. We  hope and expect this work will be done soon after we move into  the new Richter Library now nearing completion.  • 22 	asu06600000040028001							69319620 Bytes	3979	5804	3175986590	RGB	8	600	asu06600000040028001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/402	402	403.jp2	/asu0660/image/403.jp2

Developing a University Library					McNeal, Archie L.																											asu0660000005	THE  CARRE LL  Volume  3 June  1962 Number  1  DEVELOPING A  UNIVERSITY LIBRARY  By Archie L. McNeal  THE ANNOUNCEMENT that the University of Miami  Board of Trustees had authorized the construction of  the second and final phase of a new general library  building was received with general satisfaction. To many it will  represent a tangible evidence of the growing intellectual maturity  being achieved in the University's educational program.  The first unit, completed in July, 1960 was provided at a  cost of approximately $485,000. The new portion, on which  construction started in early April, 1961, will cost approximately  $3,000,000 to build and equip. The completed structure will  provide shelving for 1,000,000 volumes, seating, including 240  carrells, for 2,000 students.  Is this a library? Physically, yes. But a library is more than  concrete and glass, tables and chairs, books and shelving. A  library is a collection of books, periodicals and other forms of  print, microfilm, and manuscript material selected to serve a  particular function related to the educational objectives of the  institution it serves. It obtains breadth and depth as the scholarly  and research needs of the faculty make sufficient impact to  encourage financial support, and as the members of the library  staff, with advice and urging from the faculty, proceed to secure  the book that meets the specific need. The collection begins to  reflect the strengths and interests of the faculty. In the course  of years, the subject development may bulge in one area and  move at a more moderate pace in others.

It is the responsibility of  the librarian to keep some balance in development, giving  assistance and service to neglected areas, without diminishing  the enthusiasm of the more energetic faculty member. The  advice and assistance of the Library Advisory Committee in  making book fund allocations is of immeasurable value to the  librarian as he strives to accomplish this goal.  Institutions which have a lengthy history of development  often show the effects of their outstanding faculty members of  the past, who may have spent 30 or 40 years with the university.  Such libraries may have an outstanding Shakespeare collection,  or a superb folklore collection. In some cases, the moving force  may be gone, and the collection may have become static. In  others, the very strength of library resources in a field will tend  to perpetuate the subject in a curriculum.  It is primarily the function of the library in an educational  institution to serve the purposes for which the institution exists.  Therefore, a good library cannot be built solely on gifts and  the arbitrary purchase of large quantities of materials. The most  fallacious yardstick today is the quantitative comparison of  library resources. Quality and purpose must come first, and  without this consideration extravagance takes place by the granting of shelf space to useless concern with numerical growth.  In one respect, the University of Miami, established in 1926,  has been fortunate in the manner of its library development.  There has been no library building as such since the University  was established. As a consequence, the library has occupied  "temporary" quarters in a number of buildings. Even the space  in the "new" Merrick building into which the library moved in  1949 was planned for conversion to classrooms and offices later.  And the location of the cataloging and acquisitions departments  was of necessity some three hundred yards away in a rather  unsubstantial frame building, also known as "temporary."  The net result of the crowding, the inadequate housing, and  the diverse locations has been to impress all concerned with the  value of each foot of shelf space. Careful selection and evaluation  has been a necessity. In addition, a continual process of weeding  and discarding materials has been followed. 	asu06600000050004001							70484260 Bytes	3997	5875	2474103906	RGB	8	600	asu06600000050004001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/411	411	412.jp2	/asu0660/image/412.jp2
Developing a University Library					McNeal, Archie L.																											asu0660000005	In 1945-46, the library consisted of 53,545 volumes. It was  at this time that the University was thrust into a program of rapid  expansion by the influx of students, many post-war returnees, who  remembered Miami, many a part of the natural boom in enrollment of this period. The library, along with the educational  development, was forced into an expanded program, and by  1950 had 175,653 volumes. With strong continuing support  from administration and faculty, this total had reached 585,000  volumes by June,  1961.  As pointed out earlier, numerical strength is not our objective,  and cannot measure the adequacy of the resources. A better  understanding of the nature of the collection can be obtained  by sampling an area in which the individual is himself competent,  to determine whether standard and basic materials are present,  to make sure that current literature is being adequately secured,  and to note any serious deficiencies.  Certain substantial collections acquired in the past ten years  by the University Library may be cited in order to characterize  the development of resources. First, the Boyd Collection of  Floridiana and Americana, with particular emphasis on Florida  and the Southeastern states, provides Miami with one of the  better libraries of Florida history in the State. Through the  efforts of William Harkins, then librarian of the University of  Miami, and Charlton W. Tebeau, Chairman of the History Department, arrangements were made for the purchase of this  library from Mark F. Boyd, who had spent many years in assembling it, and is still active in its continuing development.  In November, 1954, the library of the late Sir Noel Livingston  was acquired, consisting of materials on Jamaica, its history and  government, including Votes of the Assembly from 1786.  The Western Society of Engineers Library was purchased  through the assistance of the John Crerar Library in 1955. It  provided approximately 20,000 volumes in various fields of  engineering to strengthen our resources there. Many complete  files of important journals and serials were included.  The DeValcourt Longfellow Collection was purchased from  Thomas DeValcourt, Curator of Longfellow House in 1952. It  provided first editions of all Longfellow works, some 136  different editions of Evangeline, and a total of 2,000 volumes. 	asu06600000050005001							69355540 Bytes	3979	5807	278408235	RGB	8	600	asu06600000050005001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/412	412	413.jp2	/asu0660/image/413.jp2
Developing a University Library					McNeal, Archie L.																											asu0660000005	The Lerner Collection, comprising some 5,000 volumes,  included first and other early editions of both major and minor  figures in mid-nineteenth century American literature. It was  purchased through the generosity of Michael Lerner and was  assembled by Thomas DeValcourt also.  These collections were purchased, one with funds provided  for the purpose by a friend of the library. Other funds have done  much to aid in the development of collections. Recently, articles  in The Carrell have discussed the Eder and the Tanner Collections. Each of these valuable private libraries has added outstanding material to the resources available for research.  Strategically located, the University of Miami has placed an  emphasis on Latin American relations and the library has worked  to implement programs based on this interest. The Eder Collection, mentioned above, provides strong background in Colombian  material. Exchange relationships exist with some 270 Latin  American institutions.  Another area of recent interest and one which is rapidly  developing is that of Russian publications. Through cooperation  of the Library of Congress, the University of Miami has during  the past five years secured more than 70,000 monographs and  150,000 separate periodical issues. A more detailed evaluation  of this collection appears in The Carrell for December, 1960  in an article by John T. Dorosh, former Curator of the Slavic  Collection at the Library of Congress.  These are indications of the vitality of the library as it strives  to keep pace with the emerging graduate and research program  of the University. Without the active support and interest of the  President and other administrative officials, the concern and  interest of the various Deans and their faculties, none of this  would have been possible in so short a time. Aside from the depth  of the collection, it is interesting to note that while Fremont  Rider found in a study made several years ago that the average  university library doubled in size every sixteen years, the University of Miami Library doubled in ten years. It contained 273,000  volumes in 1952 and 585,000 volumes as of June 1, 1961.  When this collection is moved into the new building, there  will still be ample space for growth for approximately twenty  years. The Medical Library and the Law Library will remain  • 4 	asu06600000050006001							70018200 Bytes	4011	5817	3461033123	RGB	8	600	asu06600000050006001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/413	413	414.jp2	/asu0660/image/414.jp2

Eventually, it is anticipated that the Engineering and  Science Libraries will be moved into the new building.  The plan of the building provides for an undergraduate library  on the first floor which will seat 800 students and have shelving  for some 50,000 volumes. This will be an open shelf collection,  with free access by the students. Also on the first floor, there  will be an exhibit hall, a lecture hall seating 150, a faculty-staff  lounge, a suite for the Recording for the Blind unit, and one  wing devoted to mechanical equipment.  From the lobby, an escalator connects the first, second and  third floors. There are also stairs. On the second floor will be  found the Reference, Circulation Catalog, and Acquisitions  Departments. Administrative offices will also be located here.  Access to the stacks will be controlled on this floor, through  the Circulation Desk.  The third floor will house the Periodicals and Government  Publications division, with more than 50,000 bound volumes  on open shelves.  The fourth through seventh floors and the ninth floor will be  devoted to stacks, and a total of 240 carrells are provided on  these floors. There are no faculty studies, but half the carrells  are built-in, over-size, with typing shelf, and large work area.  They are also sound-proofed with perforated panels and fiber  glass backing to enable the use of typewriters without disturbance  to other occupants.  The eighth floor will house the Rare Books and Special Collections, have a small reading area and six seminar rooms.  The building is completely air conditioned with a high  velocity dual-duct system, and provides for heating when needed.  Humidity control is incorporated in the system.  Otto G. Richter left his estate to the University of Miami,  with a provision in his will that one-third of it might be used  for capital improvement, the rest to go into endowment funds.  By this action, Mr. Richter made it possible for the Board of  Trustees to approve the use of funds from his benefaction for  the completion of the library. It was this source of funds which  provided $2,000,000, plus an anonymous gift of $500,000 that  insured the construction of the Otto G. Richter Library as it has  been described above.

The difference in the library of the University of Miami and those of  Harvard, Princeton, and Yale now lies in the matter of book  collections. Their resources have been developing in terms of  centuries, while those at the University of Miami have been  assembled over a few decades. Our original estimate on the  needs here included the $3,500,000 for the building, plus a  $2,000,000 endowment for books to provide a supplement to  our normal operating budget. Such a fund would make it  possible to achieve excellence in those areas selected as most  important for research and instruction at the University of Miami,  It is hoped that the young but active organization of Friends of  the University of Miami Library may undertake this as one  of their most urgent tasks, now that we have the building to  house and service such a collection. 	asu06600000050008001							67177156 Bytes	3881	5768	981032306	RGB	8	600	asu06600000050008001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/415	415	416.jp2	/asu0660/image/416.jp2
Colonial Libraries of Spanish America					Thompson, Lawrence S. (Lawrence Sidney), 1916-1986																											asu0660000005	COLONIAL LIBRARIES  OF SPANISH AMERICA  By Lawrence S. Thompson  IN 1638 John Harvard passed away and left some £780  and more than 400 books to the new collegiate institution in  Cambridge, Massachusetts. This momentous event in North  American library history took place more than a hundred years  after substantial monastic and private collections had been  established in Spanish America. In 1720 Elihu Yale donated  400 volumes to the new institution in New Haven, and in 1733  Bishop Berkeley added a hundred more. Berkeley's benefactions  came almost two centuries after Roman clergymen had displayed  similar generosity in Mexico.  When Harvard Hall burned in 1764, all but 404 of its 5,000  volumes perished. When the Jesuits were expelled from Cordoba  de Tucuman in 1767, the Colegio Maximo and the Noviciado  contained well over 5,000 volumes, a large proportion of which  have survived in Cordoba and Buenos Aires. Other libraries in  Saxon America fell substantially short of Harvard's 5,000  volumes in the pre-Revolutionary period, and the total number  of books in the libraries of any one colony was probably much  smaller than the 15,000 said to have been owned by Chilean  Jesuits at the time of the expulsion.  The history of libraries in the Americas in the nineteenth and  twentieth centuries reveals a decided superiority in the northern  continent; but during the sixteenth through the eighteenth centuries, book resources in Spanish America fell not too far short  of what could have been identified in collections in the future  United States of North America. The Roman Church and its  more aggressive orders were responsible in large measure for the  bookish characteristics of colonial Spanish America, but at the  same time they were responsible for the decline of libraries. The  tragic expulsion of the Jesuits, the stagnation and decline of  many monastic groups which once held large libraries, and the  dependence of universities on church and state were grave  handicaps to Spanish American library development after the  middle of the eighteenth century.  Books were relatively plentiful in Spanish America during 	asu06600000050009001							68989364 Bytes	3950	5820	3927207829	RGB	8	600	asu06600000050009001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/416	416	417.jp2	/asu0660/image/417.jp2

(Lawrence Sidney), 1916-1986																											asu0660000005	the first two and a half centuries of the history of our hemisphere.  This circumstance was in spite of serious handicaps to the  importation of books, for censorship lumped together without  sharp definition "los compuestos por teologos luteranos, los que  eran obscenos, sin merito alguno literario y los que versaban  sobre nigromancia y hechiceria". Law 4, Title 24, of Book I of  the Recopilacion de las leyes de Indias prohibited importation  into America of "libros de romances de materias profanas y  fabulas y historias fingidas", a regulation adopted as early as  1531. Actually these laws were enforced only when the appropriate officials saw fit to do so, and an abundance of "lying  histories" and other heretical books found their way to the Indies.  Irving A. Leonard, who has mined the records of the Casa de  Contratacion, ship manifests (registros), customs records, and  other pertinent records in the Archivo de Indias, has found  abundant evidence of the importation and circulation of light  literature. His work has been pulled together in his exciting  Books of the Brave (1949).  The story of libraries in colonial Spanish America is such a  rich and significant one that the available evidence in print falls  far short of telling us what we need to know, and the few  notes in this essay can only suggest some of the types of evidence  that need to be collected. For example, one of the earliest  references to the importation of books into the Americas may  be found in the records of the Casa de Contratacion referring  to no less distinguished a person than Bartolome de Las Casas,  who paid 10,000 maravedis to the master of the vessel Trinidad  for passage "con 4 criados, libreria, ropa y media camara" on  6 April 1517. If Las Casas was not the typical ecclesiastic, he  did share the love of books with many other prominent American  clergymen of the sixteenth century. Juan de Zumarraga, first  bishop and archbishop of Mexico, and an indefatigable friend of  printing, education, and cultural development in general, was  an avid collector and made many donations of books to  monasteries. Another notable philanthropist was Vasco de Qui-  roga, bishop of Michoacan. Deeply influenced by Sir Thomas  More's Utopia, he attempted to organize Indian communities  along the lines suggested by this work.

Donor of a splinter of the lignum crucis to the  cathedral of Mexico and founder of the Colegio de San Pablo,  he presented to the latter a select library in some sixty boxes  that he had brought from Spain.  The early library history of other Spanish settlements in the  Caribbean area, esptecially on the islands, is obscure. Nothing  has ever been published on the library of the Imperial and  Pontifical University of Santo Domingo, founded ninety-eight  years before Harvard opened its doors, although there is no  reason to assume that some evidence of books at the first American university cannot be found. The University of Havana had  a library from the beginning (1728), but we know virtually  nothing of Cuban libraries in the first two centuries of the island's  history. A library was supposed to have existed in the monastery  of Santo Domingo in San Juan de Puerto Rico as early as 1523  and to have been destroyed by the Dutch in 1625. The library  of an early bibliophilic bishop of Puerto Rico, Bernardo de  Valbuena (1568-1627), has been celebrated by Lope de Vega  in the Laurel de A polo, Silva II:  Y siempre dulce tu memoria sea,  Generoso prelado  Doctisimo Bernardo de Valbuena.  Tenias tu el cayado  De Puerto Rico cuando el fiero Enrique,  Holandes rebelado,  Robo tu liberia,  Pero tu ingenio no, que no podia,  Aunque las fuerzas del olvido aplique.  Que bien cantaste al espafiol Bernardo!  Que bien al Siglo de Oro!  Tu fuiste su prelado y su tesoro,  Y tesoro tan rico en Puerto Rico,  Que nunca Puerto Rico fue tan rico.  The various religious orders, notably the Jesuits, Franciscans,  Augustinians, Dominicans, and Mercedarians, were the most  zealous groups in bringing books to the Indies. In 1534 the first  Franciscans entered the Rio de la Plata and brought books with  them; and Pedro de Mendoza himself brought  "siete libros  medianos guarnecidos de cuero negro" and one "librete chico  dorado que dice que es Bridia guarnecido en pergamino". But  it was the Jesuits who contributed most to the bookish tradition  of the Americas, and they soon outdistanced their rivals in the 	asu06600000050011001							68411400 Bytes	3944	5780	441105552	RGB	8	600	asu06600000050011001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/418	418	419.jp2	/asu0660/image/419.jp2

Their vows included a peculiar concern for the  education of boys, and Jesuits have always wisely viewed books  as the most effective device to realize this objective. The libraries  they were able to build in Cordoba and Santa Fe de Bogota were  the equals of any in the western hemisphere at the time. In  Bogota the Jesuits had founded the Colegio de San Bartolome,  and when its book collection was converted into a Biblioteca  Publica a decade after the expulsion, 4,182 volumes were available. The library traditions of Cordoba date back at least to Don  Francisco Salcedo, dean of the Cathedral of Santiago del Estero  and one of the first Jesuits to land in Argentina (about 1586)  and to Don Diego Suarez Babiano (d. 1593), both of whom  owned good private collections containing philology as well as  theology. Many personal libraries of individual friars found their  way to the University of Cordoba's collections, a trend documented by Father Furlong. At the end of the eighteenth century  the brilliant zambo Francisco Javier Eugenio de Santa Cruz y  Espejo (1747-1795) was able to find an abundance of books in  the remains of Jesuit libraries in Quito and to reassemble them  as a public library. In Santiago de Chile Jesuit collections  amounted to some 5,000 volumes and some 15,000 in the entire  captaincy general of Chile.  The zeal of the Jesuits sometimes tends to obscure the cultural  labors of other orders. Alonso de la Vera Cruz was an Augus-  tinian, and his order held some 3,000 books a couple of centuries later in Santiago de Chile. At the same time and in the  same city the monastery of Santo Domingo owned 5,000 books,  and the Dominicans of Buenos Aires exerted strong efforts to  share in the spoils of the Jesuit collections of Cordoba. The  Franciscans worked steadily on their library in Mexico City; and  in an article on "The Development of Libraries in Mexico" in  the Library Quarterly Fernando Penalosa states, without primary  documentation, that "by the end of the eighteenth century they  had the best library in New Spain." The Franciscans took books  with them wherever they went, and they may have founded a  library in what is now the United States before any existed in  New England. It is certain that they had books in Santa Fe,  New Mexico, but, unfortunately, their archives perished in the  Pueblo Revolt of 1680.  • 10 	asu06600000050012001							68618248 Bytes	3958	5777	2045346578	RGB	8	600	asu06600000050012001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/419	419	420.jp2	/asu0660/image/420.jp2
Colonial Libraries of Spanish America					Thompson, Lawrence S. (Lawrence Sidney), 1916-1986																											asu0660000005	At least two libraries of colonial bishops have survived. Most  famous of all bibliophilic churchmen in colonial Spanish America was Juan de Palafox y Mendoza. A humanitarian comparable  to Las Casas and an enemy of the privileged regular clergy  (especially the Jesuits), he founded a seminary in Puebla de  los Angeles, the Colegio de San Pedro y San Pablo, in 1646 and  donated a library of 6,000 books. The institution prospered under  Palafox' successors, and the library continues to be housed in a  late eighteenth century building known as the Biblioteca Pala-  foxiana. Another private episcopal library survives in the Cabildo  Eclesiastico of Santiago de Chile. Originally the property of  Francisco Ruiz de Berecedo (b. 1675), it passed to Berecedo's  great nephew, Manuel de Alday y Axree, later bishop of  Santiago. Alday y Axree left it to the Cathedral of Santiago, at  which time it was said to contain "2,058 libros grandes y  pequefios, con sus estantes con 90 cajones."  Late in the eighteenth century the archbishop of Bogota and  viceroy of the Kingdom of New Granada, Antonio Caballero y  Gongora, had an important private collection. He provided a  subsidy for Jose Celestino Mutis to establish the famous Expedition Botanica in 1783, and it is certainly likely that such a  generous patron of scholarship would have made his library  freely available to scholars.  Ownership of a private collection of books was sometimes a  source of danger, although one suspects that the minions of the  Holy Office used the ownership of heretical books as an excuse  rather than a primary reason for making arrests. An especially  sad case is that of Melchor Perez de Soto, arrested on 10  January 1655 in his Mexico City residence and condemned for  owning "1502 cuerpos de libros ... en latin y en romance"  (and, even worse, some in High and Low Dutch, probably  Lutheran in content). He also owned bibliography (Leon  Pinelo's Epitome), science (Copernicus and Euclid), Mexican  imprints, and French sonnets. He died in a secret prison two  months after his arrest. When the Holy Office arrested Bernardo  Lopez de Mendizabal and his wife Dona Teresa in 1662, the  inventory of their library showed such subversive titles as Quijote,  a book of comedias by different authors, Orlando Furioso, and  Espinel's Marcos de Obregon.

But the record of Spain in the Indies is far from being  completely reactionary. The progressive ideas of the eighteenth  century penetrated our southern hemisphere, a fact demonstrated  amply by the volume edited in 1942 by A. P. Whitaker, Latin  America and the Enlightenment. Public libraries such as those  we have noted in Quito and Bogota were founded on the basis  of old Jesuit collections. Public-spirited organizations such as  the Sociedad Economica de Amigos del Pais in Havana founded  libraries; and the collection of this particular organization  thrived steadily and in the late 1950s was still the most  practical collection in Havana for researchers in things Cuban.  In 1788 the Cathedral of Mexico accepted and opened for public  use the Biblioteca Turriana, founded by the two brothers Torres  and their uncle. The municipal government of Mexico City  made contributions to its support, and it is said to have accumulated 19,000 volumes.  It has been well established that there were books in colonial  Spanish America in far greater abundance than the supporters  of the leyenda negra would have us believe. In some cases we  know the contents of the collections and something about their  provenance and fate. On the other hand, a vast amount of  digging needs to be done in the history of specific libraries.  Many old collections still exist and have been neglected until  recently. Thus the University of Cuzco, heir to local Jesuit  collections, was not able to inventory and to clean and repair  the books until 1938. We still know nothing about the priests  who originally assembled this collection, when it came into  existence, what titles it originally contained, how it was used  and by whom, and the precise history of the confiscation. Until  these iacts are known for many more communities that were  cultural centers in the colonial period, the full story cannot be  pieced together.

Notes on Expressionism					Selle, Carl M.																											asu0660000005	NOTES ON EXPRESSIONISM  By Carl M. Selle  ANY enthusiast can predict future art modes because he  cannot be checked here and now and because "the  L future has no features." Hemingway said that the  baroque was dead and would so continue, and then saw baroque  developments on all sides, such as in interplay of shadow and  substance on concrete and metal in architecture, in decor of  many varieties, and in the films of Ingmar Bergman. It is neither  brash nor jejune to predict that expressionism, in its largest sense,  will flourish in the years not too far ahead, inasmuch as the  conditions that permitted and forced the growth of expressionism  in Europe before the first World War and after it are present,  with some variations and new stresses, all over this country and  will increase stupendously.  Thus the critic can nod his head with easy inevitability when  he learns that the Swedish Royal Dramatic Theater will present,  to the holiday gapers at the Seattle World's Fair, two most  unholiday plays by a colossus of expressionism, August Strind-  berg. Not cotton candy, nor colored fountains and "sculptured  light," nor panoramas of "miracle" and "magic" household  gadgets and products can set a tone that is unreceptive to a play  about a girl who is talked into cutting her throat with a straight  razor, or a play about a man who is methodically degraded and  killed by woman as vampire: good expressionism carries everything before it.  Some of the facts and conditions pointing to a crescent expressionism in the years ahead are these: the rapid depersonalizing  and impersonalizing of many aspects of American society; the  viewing of citizens, and even of children, as blind-mouth consumers, of purchasing and more purchasing as the summum  bonum; the weight of the military, whether untoward as in the  case of General Walker or potent and glamorous as in the case  of many others; the drawing taut of lines that are vindictive and  dangerous to the common weal, such as bumper signs reading  "Impeach Chief Justice Warren" and "Buy Christian;" the  wonderment at varieties of price manipulations; the rapid  despoilment of natural resources, beauty, and purity; the lowering  • 13 	asu06600000050018001							68474300 Bytes	3934	5800	620139729	RGB	8	600	asu06600000050018001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/425	425	426.jp2	/asu0660/image/426.jp2
Notes on Expressionism					Selle, Carl M.																											asu0660000005	of traditional American bourgeois tone and influence; the increase  of glib pseudo-clinical and pseudo-psychological analysis, such  as the notion that Huckleberry Finn is an unconscious allegory of  homosexual love (what a deterring image of America to present  to foreigners who are also accumulating Russian and Moslem  images); the fear of atomic destruction and the attending fear  that most citizens are denied voice in the matter; the visible  increase of wantlessness and related strivings for prestige of person in new terms; the decreasing use of firm and traditional precept throughout the land; the dullness and dead-end character of  much realism-naturalism; the wasteland of mass media; the great  American highway slaughter (there is no doubt at all that expressionists would have written poems and prose diatribes about this  as evidence of character instability); the gross permissiveness in  the use of our language, now even sanctioned by a dictionary  known the world over for its assured American precept; escapist  preoccupation with outer space at the expense of last-stand earth  issues; and so on.  It is necessary to mention such aspects of our civilization in  order to present the medium in which expressionism can, and  surely will, increasingly function. The Reverend Robert J. Gannon, distinguished man of the cloth and former president of  Fordham University, went counter to popular adulation of cosmonaut Glenn by saying that "some Americans are beginning to  wonder if Colonel John Glenn might have been a high grade  chimpanzee who followed a low grade chimpanzee into orbit."  This rebellious thought the educator followed with loving remarks  concerning the nothingness of man in outer vastness and the  necessity for man to feel his "eminence over all creation." It does  not here matter significantly to what extent one holds with this  view: the point is that it falls essentially under expressionism in  being both rebellious and loving, in opposing a popular view with  bite and edge sharpened by a passionately held philosophy, in  being radical as idea but non-radical as act.  Consider again the list above of phases of our society favoring  the growth of expressionism. There can be several reactions to  these phases: abject uncritical acceptance and sitz-bath comfort  in the status quo; sans-culotte rioting in the streets; indifference  on the basis that nothing counts except the cold war; Russian-  • 14 	asu06600000050019001							68985736 Bytes	3960	5805	1046796766	RGB	8	600	asu06600000050019001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/426	426	427.jp2	/asu0660/image/427.jp2
Notes on Expressionism					Selle, Carl M.																											asu0660000005	inspired "socialist realism" and attending official control of all  the arts; crude native censorship of everything that strikes anybody; ardent and adept legislative action to cure everything;  drowning in drink; residence in the Bahamas or Virgin Islands;  and so on. But fortunately the vigor of our environmental and  artistic currents and crosscurrents, and sheer inevitability of  change away from the present state (with its uncertainty of  realism-naturalism) indicate a surge of expressionist use and  appreciation. The point is driven home by marked trends in  motion pictures (some of them an improvement on the classic  expressionism of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari) and by nascent  trends in advertising and display. Expressionism is irresistible  owing to its inner rebelliousness and transvaluation, its love of  neighbor and feeling for universal brotherhood in a brave new  world, its general religious promptings (which were mostly non-  creedal but, owing to changes since the zenith of the movement,  need not be so and in fact can be orthodox), its unabashed  devotion to the poetic-artistic-literary, its divine discontent (the  perfect antidote to an excess of "togetherness" and "belonging-  ness"), its proud individualism.  If one reviews the lives of the expressionists, and if one reviews  the best works of creators such as Chagall (charmer of the  western world), Kollwitz (among the most humane of all  women), Munch (bourgeois Dante who took dread journeys to  pictorial hell and back to light), Werfel (Jewish believer in  man's search for verities, at Lourdes he vowed to write the story  of Bernadette), Wedekind, Strindberg (called by O'Neill the  greatest dramatic interpreter of modern spiritual conflicts),  Picasso, Marc, Barlach (whose sculpture trumpets grand religious  insight), Marin, Kaiser, O'Neill, and many others—if one reviews  these, one is struck time and again by the warmth and constructive boldness of their insights, by their ability to cut through  modern complexities to essentials that have to be called both  useable and beautiful, by their relentless manifestation of love  and respect for human dignity, by their hatred of excess or stultification in certain social, commercial, and military aspects of  society, by both their iron control and their free fantasy in painting, sculpture, poetry, drama, and other art forms.  Most people associate expressionism with painting and other  • 15 	asu06600000050020001							68372548 Bytes	3937	5787	2682108933	RGB	8	600	asu06600000050020001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/427	427	428.jp2	/asu0660/image/428.jp2
Notes on Expressionism					Selle, Carl M.																											asu0660000005	graphic art, but the movement also contains much literature of  highest order. The dramas of Strindberg, Kaiser, Toller, Capek,  O'Casey, and others are known well enough, but most or much  of the Continental verse is not widely known. One of the finest  expressionist poems is by Franz Werfel and is entitled with typical simplicity and directness "I Have Done A Good Deed." The  poem clearly reveals several aspects of expressionism: yearning  for human contact often unachieved by normally available means,  the desire to mingle with others spiritually and quintessentially,  a sense of love and brotherhood, the animation of inanimate  objects, "radiations of the ego," an aura of pristineness not marred  by prosaic details, and others. (The writer of these notes has  translated this poem, and the two following, into prose, thus of  necessity losing much flavor and fervor.)  Heart rejoice. I have done a good deed. Now I am no  longer lonesome. A human being lives, there lives a  human being whose eyes moisten when he thinks of  me. Heart, rejoice. A human being lives. No longer,  no longer am I lonesome, for I have done a good  deed. Rejoice, heart. — Now the sighing days have  their end. A thousand good deeds I want to do. I  already feel how all love me. I stream along full of  bliss of recognition. You my latest, sweetest, clearest,  purest, plainest feeling: good will. A thousand good  deeds I want to do. — Most beautiful gratification  is bestowed on me. Thankfulness. Thankfulness of the  world. Still objects throw themselves into my arms.  Quiet and still objects which I in a fulfilled hour  stroked like fine animals. — My writing desk creaks.  I know it wants to embrace me. The piano tries to  play my favorite piece; secretly and unskilled all the  strings sound together. The book I am reading opens  the pages by itself. — I have done a good deed. — I  want to wander through green nature where the trees  and the entwining vines pursue me. The herbs and  flowers gather me in, groping roots already seize me,  tender branches bind me firmly, leaves ripple over me  as softly as thin sparse-falling water. — Many hands  grab toward me, many green hands. All nested-in by  love and loveliness I stand captive. — I have done a  good deed, full of joy and well-wishing am I. And no  more alone. No, no more alone. Rejoice, my heart.  The next poem, also by Werfel, veers somewhat toward realism  but without losing the tone of restlessness and urgency.

Notes on Expressionism					Selle, Carl M.																											asu0660000005	lis, and even though they are both of the same temperament, they  are unable to have enough points of contact. If their essences  mingled more they would, with useful resolve, face the depersonalization of the city, find others like themselves, and effect  social union and some kind of reform. The poem is wholly non-  political. It is entitled "Human Beings Are Unable to Communicate."  I have given you the farewell kiss and cling nervously  to your hand. I am already reminding you to take  care of this or that detail. Human beings are unable to  communicate. — Won't the train, the train at last  whistle? I feel more and more that I will never see  you again. I speak round rhetorical sentences that  have no understanding. Human beings cannot get  through to each other. — I know that if I no more  had you it would be death, death, death. God, a  cigarette. Human beings are dumb. — So be it: you  are gone. Now out in the street, weeping chokes me.  I look around astonished, for even weeping does not  say what we mean. Human beings cannot communicate.  The third poem could have been selected from those dealing  with themes such as protest against war, poverty and dullness  among the masses ("the ox-like, limp and leaden-eyed" named  in another culture by Vachel Lindsay), capital-labor disturbances, conspicuous and arrogant waste, vaunting display of  leisure, galloping materialism, impotent liberalism, cruel gaps  between rich and poor, and others. Instead, an expressionist  nature poem here shows further variety of the movement. It has  the simple title "Autumn." The expressionist's autumn turns itself  inside out to reveal its essence and inner impact; it embraces the  human being so that he ceases to be a spectator or vacationer and  enters into the, or an, idea-feeling of autumnality. (Compare this  with impressionist treatments and with the romanticism of Keats.)  The poem is by Wilhelm Klemm.  The years cut across each other. Horned graves stare  at us. The wind wafts thin. Countries unpeople themselves. Thoughts filter slowly into the gray. — But the  foliage is the same; we drink a dead wine and follow  the motions of forgetting, which are sweeter than  remembering. — Smoke vapors up faraway and sad;  it mists so strong that one could fall asleep within it.  Who will send us home in the darkness? And the  dogs that bark so loudly?  • 17 	asu06600000050022001							68969188 Bytes	3963	5798	2136980579	RGB	8	600	asu06600000050022001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/429	429	430.jp2	/asu0660/image/430.jp2
Notes on Expressionism					Selle, Carl M.																											asu0660000005	If one keeps these three poems in mind and pages through a  good volume of modern art (Haftmann's Painting in the  Twentieth Century is one of the best), the relation between  expressionist verbal art and graphic art is apparent in richest  variety. In fact the manifestation of expressionism in so large a  number of art forms (these notes do not even mention music and  architecture) lends added strength to the belief that it will have  telling influence in the near future.  Among the theories and applications of literary criticism, probably none is more important than the nature and impact of  tragedy. Obviously no student can avoid Aristotle on the subject,  down to details of changes in the acceptance of the unities. The  shift in tragic view has been authoritatively put by Ludwig Lew-  isohn as follows:  Traditionally the serious drama deals with the transgression of an immutable moral law by a self-originating will. The tragic action began with or, more usually,  rose toward the incurring of that tragic guilt, and  ended with the protagonist's expiation of his transgression . . . The free scientific and philosophical  inquiry of the later nineteenth century, however, rendered the traditional principles of tragedy wholly  archaic. It became clear that the self-originating element in human action is small. The individual acts in  harmony with his character, which is largely the result  of complex and uncontrollable causes. It became even  clearer that among the totality of moral values an  absolute validity can be assigned to a few only. Hence  the basic conception of tragic guilt was undermined  from within and from without. The transgression of an  immutable moral law by a self-originating will was  seen to be an essentially meaningless conception, since  neither an eternally changeless moral law nor an uncaused volition is to be found in the universe that we  perceive . . . Thus the emphasis of the drama was  shifted from what men do to what they suffer. A questioning attitude exercised itself upon nature and upon  society. Tragedy was seen to arise not from the frailty  or rebellion of a corrupted will defying the changeless  • 18 	asu06600000050023001							68868372 Bytes	3969	5782	1919408586	RGB	8	600	asu06600000050023001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/430	430	431.jp2	/asu0660/image/431.jp2
Notes on Expressionism					Selle, Carl M.																											asu0660000005	moral order, but from the pressure upon the fluttering  and striving will of outworm custom, of unjust law, of  inherited instinct, of malevolent circumstance . . .  Thus Lewisohn in the flush of early if not pioneer estimate of  the new drama of Ibsen, Hauptmann, Sudermann, Halbe, Schnitz-  ler, Brieux, Galsworthy, and others. At the center of all  appraisals, even over-enthusiastic ones, of the emergence of  serious modern plays is the matter of bourgeois man and of  working-class man as proper subject of tragedy (both these  classifications coalesce in the phrase "common man"). Today the  author of Death of a Salesman has every right to pronounce  firmly on this artistic-ethical subject, and of course holds that  "the common man is as apt a subject for tragedy in its highest  sense as kings were," Now, all artistic theories and manifestations  of the common man are made clearer and broader by expressionist transvaluation and feeling for human brotherhood and  quintessential mingling. In fact the expressionist forthright awareness and treatment of the active complexities in modern life of  free will and of determinism account considerably for the grave  moral atmosphere in which the common man flourishes as significant figure capable of tragic dimension. These notes do not  imply that expressionists solved full-circle the grand problem of  free will and determinism: what is stated is that the problem is  incorporated in their high seriousness and in their transvaluation  of society and man's place in it. The works of Kathe Kollwitz,  Edvard Munch, Ernst Barlaeh, Wilhelm Lehmbruck, Picasso,  Paul Klee, Vasily Kandinsky, Marc Chagall and many others are  prime tragedies of the choices and fate of the common man. This  relation of modern tragedy in expressionist graphic and plastic  art to modern tragedy in drama is one of the great areas insufficiently examined by scholarship.  To be sure, there were some expressionists who were inadmis-  sibly destructive and excessive, but we can now minimize their  influence. And if anyone wonders about the furious vagaries of  Strindberg's life, let him read the play Easter and then re-embrace  the playwright. The expressionists were moralizers and reformers  and thus were the antithesis of art for art's sake or of anything  merely antiquarian. But they were neither Fabians (Bernard  Shaw actually held public office and knew all about sewers,  • 19 	asu06600000050024001							70286200 Bytes	3990	5870	2581879144	RGB	8	600	asu06600000050024001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/431	431	432.jp2	/asu0660/image/432.jp2

In fact the entire expressionist movement is reform by art,  whether stated as actual themes dealing with the individual in  society, or (perhaps best reform of all) stated as perfection of  artistic insight and treatment, even in its most abstract.  The chief point of these too brief notes on a major art mode  is the conviction that certain conditions of modern society need  and yearn for, will profit by, and will take laudable delight in the  varieties of expressionism that are surely soon to flourish beyond  their present state. Schools and libraries can substantially contribute to the new flourishing, particularly by presenting historical  development and arousing general critical awareness. Much of  the best modern art falls under expressionism, and some of the  finest examples are fortunately housed in the Museum of Modern  Art in New York. The industrialist and art patron John Hay  Whitney, as chairman of the board of trustees, firmly touches  several of the essential virtues of expressionism when he says:  We believe that the collection . . . represents our  respect for the individual and for his ability to contribute to society as a whole through free use of his  individual gifts in his individual manner. This freedom  we believe fundamental to democratic society.  20 	asu06600000050025001							68090460 Bytes	3944	5753	3809116580	RGB	8	600	asu06600000050025001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/432	432	433.jp2	/asu0660/image/433.jp2
Special Collections of the Richter Library																																asu0660000005	SPECIAL COLLECTIONS OF THE  RICHTER LIBRARY  THE generous space alloted to rare books and special  collections in the new Otto G. Richter Library will  stimulate inquiry about the materials housed therein.  As early as the mid-thirties we acquired the gift of F. E.  Betheuser, a handsome set of Reichenbachia. Yet it was a mere  thirteen years ago that the Librarian, William G. Harkins, and  the Acquisitions Librarian, C. Lewis Morgan, followed a New  England lead that brought them to an auction house in which  were for sale several loaded bookcases from the home of a  discriminating private collector; to this we now refer, with  respect, as the real beginning of our collecting of special materials, including a nucleus of hard-to-obtain works in Spanish  literature and philology.  The Noel Brooks Livingston Collection on the history of  Jamaica was purchased in 1953, and from this voluminous body  of historical materials many books found their way into our  special collection which by then had begun to be shaped to our  broader all-Caribbean, all-Latin America interests.  The Library's efforts to obtain special or rare materials consistently parallels its general acquisition policy in two specific  ways. Where the general collection is developing toward noticeable strength throughout the humanities, social sciences, and  natural sciences, as well as in business and engineering, the  special collections aim toward providing significant source materials for the enrichment of graduate study in literature, history,  and modern languages, and a sound basis for the study of  economics. Early editions of Dryden, Camden, Bentham, Dug-  dale, Cotton Mather, Sir Walter Raleigh, and an extensive collection of Wallace Stevens first editions indicate the range of  our recent gifts and purchases. Of the very sizeable gifts of  books, pamphlets, and manuscripts presented to the Library  within the last five years by Dr. Theodore Parker, by Mrs.  O. J. Tanner, and by Mrs. Lon Worth Crow and others, fully  eighty percent contribute to our special collections in the areas  of literature, history, and economics.  In  1954-1955 the Library acquired the outstanding Long-  • 21 	asu06600000050026001							68967472 Bytes	3944	5827	1919350307	RGB	8	600	asu06600000050026001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/433	433	434.jp2	/asu0660/image/434.jp2
Special Collections of the Richter Library																																asu0660000005	f  fellow Collection that had been brought together by Thomas  DeValcourt, Curator of Longfellow House in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and also Mr. DeValcourt's collection of some 5000  volumes of other nineteenth century American literature, which  was purchased and presented to the Library by Michael Lerner.  The second way in which our acquisition of rare or special  materials purposefully parallels our acquisition for the general  collection, whether by gift or by purchase, is in the building up  of a substantial body of research material in certain clearly  defined areas: Floridiana, Colombiana, Latin American bibliography, Spanish literature and philology, the history of Cuba.  As rapidly as possible we are adding to our already important  list of Medina bibliographies. Almost fifty years of the Gazeta de  la Habana, ending in 1897, and very long runs spanning the  period 1782-1835 of Gazeta de Madrid and Diario de Madrid,  quite recently purchased, will prove to be of major importance in  the study of Cuba, of the American Revolution, and of the  Peninsular Wars.  In 1960-1961 the gift of his library of Colombiana by Phanor  G. Eder, lent conspicuous value volume-by-volume to our holdings in Latin Americana. There are the 1533 Peter Martyr, first  editions of Esquemeling, Aeosta, and many other early writers  of travel books so highly desirable to any scholar working in the  history of this hemisphere, and beyond that the manuscript and  typescript record of more than half a century of the Eder family's  sojourn and contribution to the business and agricultural development of the Cauca Valley.  In the late nineteen-forties the Library purchased Dr. Mark  F. Boyd's collection on the history of Florida. Of the eight  thousand volumes in the collection, a very respectable number  were added to our special collections.  By no means all of the Library's rare and special materials  have been processed. Meanwhile, the Library staff permits, in  fact encourages, qualified scholars to seek the use of both processed and unprocessed materials.  The opening of the new Library building, with its closed stack  area and seminar rooms, and with its spacious rare book reading  room, begins a new era for research in South Florida.

Contributors to This Issue																																asu0660000005	CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS ISSUE  Archie L. McNeal is Director of Libraries and Professor of  Library Science at the University of Miami. He received his  doctorate degree from the University of Chicago. In eleven  years at the University of Miami he has vastly strengthened its  library collections, and has played a major role in planning  the new Richter Library building, whose doors will be open  this month to librarians attending the American Library Association annual conference at Miami Beach.  Lawrence S. Thompson has been Director of the University  of Kentucky Library since 1948. After formal library studies  at the University of Michigan he ". . . prepped in the Widener,  graduated from the New York Public, and did post-graduate  work at the Library of Congress," this being his way of saying  that, although never a staff member in those institutions, the  privilege of studying their great collections is the finest of educational opportunities. His interest in Spanish America is based  on four War years spent there as a special agent of the F.B.I.  Carl M. Selle, Associate Professor of English and Humanities,  is President of the Florida Gamma Association of Phi Beta  Kappa. He instructs in the University of Miami Honors Program.  In quest of his own interpretation of expressionism, he made  several tours of European art galleries from Norway to Sicily,  looking and absorbing.  Richard L. Merrick, Associate Professor of Art and contriver  of five previous covers of The Carrell, chose one of the Richter  Library's 240 carrells for the current issue's wood engraving.  In further defiance of the tradition that carrells are devoted  exclusively to monkish contemplation, he has peopled his modern  carrell with a woman scholar.

Ralegh's The History of the World					McCollum, John I.																											asu0660000009	THE  CARRELL  Volume 5 June 1964 Number 1  Ralegh's The History of the World  By John I. McCollum, Jr.  MEDIEVAL and Renaissance writers for the most  part approached history very much as an epic story  or as a divine drama in which the historian saw  everywhere the fulfillment of God's plan. For the Renaissance  the major justification for the study of the past was its educative  power. Stemming from both classical and medieval tradition,  modified by Renaissance humanism and the Reformation, such  statements as Thomas Blundeville's The True Order and Methode  of Wryting and Reading Hystories, according to the precepts of  Francisco Patricio and Acconito Tridentino summarize the didactic function: first by studying the past men may be led to perceive  the providence of God in this world; second, they may thus be  led to act wisely in both personal and civil affairs; third, by the  example of others seen in the pages of history, they may be encouraged to seek good and to shun evil.  The principal function is thus to demonstrate the providential  character of God and the necessity for both magistrate and citizen to order their affairs prudentially. Similarly Sir Philip Sidney  could state as a commonplace that the purpose of history was  simply to teach virtue by allowing the readers to "follow the  footing of them that have gone before."  The extent of national preoccupation with history can be  demonstrated by the great number of English translations of histories from both ancient and modern tongues. Every major writer  is represented. (Herodotus, Polybius, Thucydides, Xenophon,  Caesar, Suetonius, Pliny, Plutarch, Tacitus, Sallust, Josephus,  Diodorus Siculus, Giraldus Cambrensis, Froissart, Machiavelli,  •   1 	asu06600000090003001							33473620 Bytes	3794	5615	4163210189	RGB	8	600	asu06600000090003001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/442	442	443.jp2	/asu0660/image/443.jp2
Ralegh's The History of the World					McCollum, John I.																											asu0660000009	Bodin, Commines, Guicciardini). In addition, books offering  direct advice to rulers, mirrors of conduct and fortune, chronicles,  universal and world histories multiplied in number and popularity as the sixteenth century drew to a close. Among the more  illustrious English writers may be included Polydore Vergil, Sir  Thomas More, Francis Bacon, William Camden, Richard Grafton, Edward Halle, William Harrison, Raphael Holinshed, John  Stow — to name only the more prominent.  Such men rarely attempted what the twentieth century historian would consider objective analysis and evaluation. They  were dealing with what had been accepted as truth and substantiated by the test of time. English writers gave ample evidence  of the pride of Englishmen in things English, the protestant bias  of Elizabeth, the interest of the Tudors in their own legendary  past, the desire to discover the nation's antiquity, and a confident  sense of national destiny.  One of the great achievements of a century of historical  writing, beginning with Polydore Vergil's commission by Henry  VII to write a history of England, was Ralegh's The History of  the World. Few works have summarized so vividly in conception,  theory, and practice the traditions out of which they have grown.  If Ralegh may be considered, as is often suggested, the last Elizabethan, it is fitting that he should end his career with a project  so ambitious and so characteristic of his age as The History of  the World. Like the Faerie Queene, Drayton's Polyolbion, Shakespeare's English history plays, the Mirror for Magistrates, Daniel's Civil Warrs, Holinshed's Chronicle, and Bacon's Instauratio  Magna, Ralegh's work reveals the intellectual assurance, the  expansive vision and daring conception which characterize so  much of the Renaissance life—the same boldness that led Drake,  Hawkins, and Ralegh himself to venture still strange, if not entirely unknown, seas to enrich England and to establish for her  an empire in a new world.  Imprisoned, "civilly dead," disliked if not feared by his monarch, encumbered by wounds both spiritual and physical "which  are ever aking while uncured," his life drawing to a close under  the constant shadow of the executioner, he projected a universal  history while carrying on chemical and pharmaceutical experiments, writing political treatises, attempting to recoup his per- 	asu06600000090004001							63423848 Bytes	3773	5600	1462802772	RGB	8	600	asu06600000090004001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/443	443	444.jp2	/asu0660/image/444.jp2
Ralegh's The History of the World					McCollum, John I.																											asu0660000009	sonal fortunes (especially his beloved estate Sherborne), all the  while planning an ambitious expedition to Guiana.  The work was entered in the Stationers' Register on April 15,  1611. It was not printed, however, until 1614, when Walter  Burre, who had published several of Ben Jonson's works, issued  a large folio volume without the author's name. In the same  year followed a second issue containing corrections of errata  occurring in the first. A striking feature of the folio is the frontispiece engraved by Renold Elstracke from the author's own design. In it Ralegh laid down in emblematic outline his conception  of history and the philosophic attitude out of which it grew. Like  most of his contemporaries he went to Cicero for his characterizing statement:  . . . testis temporum, lux veritatis, vita memoriae,  magistra vitae, nuntia vetustatis,  but supplemented the classical with a Christian interpretation.  The frontispiece pictures History, the Mistress of Life, radiant  with light and supporting the world. Treading upon skeletal  Death and sleeping Oblivion, she is attended on one side by  solemn Experience, who holds a rod and line with which she  measures and sounds the depth of human affairs; on the other  side is naked Truth whose right hand blazes with light. On either  side of the elevated globe stand the spotted figure of 111 Fame  and the bright, laurel-crowned figure of Good Fame trumpeting  to the world their reports; centered above all is the Eye of Providence overlooking the world and History. The Mistress of Life  is flanked by four columns or pillars representing Time's Witness,  the Herald of Antiquity, the Light of Truth, and the Life of  Memory.  Thus far Ralegh is somewhat conventional in pictorializing  Cicero's statement. But characteristically he adds a purely personal note in portraying on his globe the ocean between the new  and old worlds, on which ships are engaged in battle, with South  America to the fore and the Orinoco as the single river represented, recalling, of course, his own adventures on behalf of his  nation.  Ralegh was condemned by some of his critics for publishing  under his own name the work of others. Ben Jonson, for example, 	asu06600000090005001							63950880 Bytes	3823	5574	2698098813	RGB	8	600	asu06600000090005001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/444	444	445.jp2	/asu0660/image/445.jp2
Ralegh's The History of the World					McCollum, John I.																											asu0660000009	said that "the best wits of England were employed for making  his Historie." That he was learned for his time is hardly open  to dispute. He was a university man, a man of letters, a student of political science. He seems to have loved research all  his life. Aubrey reports that he was "no slug" but was "up betimes  to read." His name is listed among the members of the Society  of Antiquaries organized by Archbishop Parker. On every voyage, by report, he carried a trunk of books. Moreover, he had  the indispensable advantage of eleven years' leisure while imprisoned in the Tower. Ralegh confessed his ignorance of Hebrew; he seems to have used Latin translations of many Greek  writers. But any criticism of this nature that may be laid to his  charge may be charged as well to Holinshed, Fabyan, Polydore  Vergil, and the entire host of historians of the age. Most histories  of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries were little more than the  work of a predecessor restated and brought up to date, flavored  perhaps by contemporary political interests. The chroniclers  ordinarily relied heavily and uncritically upon Biblical history,  Josephus, Greek and Roman accounts, Gildas, Bede, and Geoffrey of Monmouth. Plutarch seems to have been a favorite source  with Ralegh. What some have regarded as a defect is indeed a  virtue, for apparently Ralegh availed himself of some of the best  minds in England. Sir Robert Cotton and other friends made  available to him their books. He consulted Dr. Robert Burhill  concerning Greek, Mosaic and Oriental antiquities; he relied  on Thomas Hariot for geography, chronology, and mathematics;  Ben Jonson apparently contributed a section on the Punic Wars.  Surrounded by learned men, Ralegh was nevertheless very  much his own man. The book is full of personal insights, recollections, metaphysical and ethical reflection, outcries against injustices, laments over man's littleness in the grand scheme of  things. He cannot resist the temptation, for example, to interrupt  his history to assert the superiority of the English over the ancient  Roman soldiers, or to recall his own victory at Fayal and to  suggest the advantages of control of the sea.  Like most of his predecessors Ralegh proposed to set forth a  description of Creation and a history of the world as background  for the history of "this our renowned Hand of Great Brittaine."  He saw the record of the past as an evidence of God's judgment: 	asu06600000090006001							63242280 Bytes	3749	5621	324216208	RGB	8	600	asu06600000090006001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/445	445	446.jp2	/asu0660/image/446.jp2
Ralegh's The History of the World					McCollum, John I.																											asu0660000009	How Kings and Kingdomes have florished and  fallen; and for what vertue and piety GOD made  prosperous; and for what vice and deformity he  made wretched . . . Wee may gather out of History a policy no leese wise than eternall; by the  comparison and application of other mens fore-  passed miseries, with our owne like errours and ill  deservings.  Despite his protestation "That I malice no man under the  Sunne," many of his readers thought that they could discover in  the portraits, or in the commentary, direct or implied allusion to  contemporaries. Upon its publication James called for its suppression on the somewhat flimsy grounds that Ralegh had  disparaged Henry VIII and had too saucily treated kings in  general. In addition, it was reported that James thought that  Ralegh had portrayed him too closely in the person of Ninias,  successor to the great queen Semiramis — "esteemed no man of  war at all, but altogether feminine, and subjected to ease and  delicacy."  Prince Henry, Ralegh's patron, died before the book was finished. The work was carried only to the period of Roman supremacy; the history of England was never written, and he notes in  his preface that the work "is now left to the World without a  Maister." Beset by criticism and discouragement — "I am on  the ground already . . ." — he refused to continue work on a  second and third volume.  Very much like his personal history, The History of the World  received the condemnation of those who could have done most  for him and the approbation of the public in general. In spite of  the early suppression, the work went through more editions in  the seventeenth century than the work of either Spenser or  Shakespeare. It became a handbook of instruction, popular with  the Puritans; and to opponents of the Jacobean regime Ralegh  seemed a victim of James' unpopular Spanish policy.  It was read by revolutionaries like John Hampden and Milton;  Oliver Cromwell advised his son Richard to "recreate" himself  by reading this "Body of History." Edward Stillingfleet, a churchman, quoted it on the Flood; the antiquary William Dugdale  could not "better express" or account for the "origins of govern- 	asu06600000090007001							64603836 Bytes	3840	5606	1631143034	RGB	8	600	asu06600000090007001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/446	446	447.jp2	/asu0660/image/447.jp2

Milton apparently used it, and many scholars see a  foreshadowing of Miltonic rhythms in Ralegh.  His style reveals an ability to suggest the pageant-like quality  of the rise and fall of princes and empires; the narrative has a  spontaneity that allows him almost impetuous interruptions to  relate his personal experiences, to draw analogies from his own  times, to meditate upon the moral implications of his subject, or  to discourse with some learning upon Biblical history, the law,  naval strategy. Sometimes flamboyant, sometimes deftly epigrammatic, his History somehow takes on the nature of personal  experience. Ralegh is learned but not bookish. His language has  a striking freshness, characterized by such colloquialisms as  . . . who-so-ever in writing a moderne Historie,  shall follow truth too neare the heeles, it may  happily strike out his teeth.  and (in reference to the use of navies to prevent the landing of  an aggressor)  ... to entertaine those that shall assaile us, with  their owne beefe in their bellies, and before they  eate of our Kentish Capons, I take it to be the  wisest way.  One of the most notable of the rhetorical flights is the digression on death, which forms a fitting comment on the mutability  of man and an apt period to his own historical philosophy:  O eloquent, just and mightie Death! whom none  could advise, thou hast perswaded; what none  hath dared, thou hast done; and whom all the  world hath flattered, thou only hast cast out of the  world and despised: thou hast drawne together all  the farre stretched greatnesse, all the pride, cruel-  tie, and ambition of man, and covered it all over  with these two narrow words, Hie iacet.  Like its predecessors, the great chronicles and mirrors, the  work has little interest today as an history in itself. However, it  retains its freshness as a literary work, and, by exemplification  as well as prefatory statement, it synthesizes admirably a major  position of Renaissance historiography. 	asu06600000090008001							63229920 Bytes	3759	5605	2424195610	RGB	8	600	asu06600000090008001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/447	447	448.jp2	/asu0660/image/448.jp2

Eugene Massin: Artist					Bitter, John																											asu0660000009	EUGENE MASSIN: ARTIST  By John Bitter  HE WORKS in Coconut Grove on a winding, narrow  lane, ending in a loop. His studio is not easy to find  and neither are the words to describe this intense and  independent painter.  Gene Massin is a hospitable soul who looks like a retired  halfback, except perhaps for his searching and gently troubled  expression. After a quiet and sometimes pithy welcome he leads  the visitor through an unidentifiable area where a sink with  the look of the ages, a few gray cups, a hot plate, a jar of instant coffee and a tired ash tray are visible. The building, shared  with sculptor Al Vrana, is an old stone house gradually transformed by a series of architectural spasms and upheavals into  a studio.  The subjects of his paintings are studied, outlined, drawn  over and over again with crayon or charcoal, revised and then  painted on canvases of a variety of sizes. Each effort is newly  considered and the subject challenged. There isn't a line or a  brush stroke that hasn't strength or conviction. His work is intensely autobiographical. Street Scene, Lawmaker, Court Recess,  Members of the Bar (jury duty, not transgressions, motivated  this preoccupation with our judicial system) Double Self Portrait, Courtesans, Football, and Soldiers are typical titles. Abstraction, expressionism, impressionism, nonobjectivism are styles  of which one is aware. None dominate or even matter. He communicates the value of a scene or a character or a mood directly  and with conviction. The thick accents, the conserving of color,  the well digested and considered focal points all add up to an  individual and powerful expression.  Names and localities associated with Gene Massin as painter,  teacher, student and human being are Spain, The Ford Foundation, University of Wisconsin, New York's Metropolitan Museum  of Art, the Far East, Escuela Universitaria de Bellas Artes in  Mexico, Look Magazine, the Chicago Art Institute and Texas,  where he was born. He is a member of the University of Miami  faculty. 	asu06600000090011001							64022860 Bytes	3808	5601	390605454	RGB	8	600	asu06600000090011001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/450	450	451.jp2	/asu0660/image/451.jp2
The Laurel Wreath					Lawrence, Natalie Grimes																											asu0660000009	The Laurel Wreath  By Natalie Grimes Lawrence  F^ETRARCH is the poet who loved Laura and immortal-  *ized her in the canzoniere, songs and sonnets written in  the Tuscan tongue to which he was born. He wrote the four  longer poems to Laura the Trionfi, also in Italian, but the  greater part of Petarch's writing, both prose and poetry, was in  Latin upon which he himself founded his hopes of fame. Historians recognize him as initiator of the return to the classics of  Rome and Greece which ushered in the Renaissance. All told,  he has not been easy to forget, as the independent quality of his  mind, combined with singular imaginative power linked to the  "apostolic gift of perfect surrender to a cause . . . the cause  of ancient Rome" allowed him to break from medieval viewpoints and to propel what he saw of virtu into the thinking of  the modern western world. Renan considered Petrarch the first  modern critic; hardly can one who reads his prose escape the fact  that he looked at life with his own eyes, establishing new ways  of thinking about that which had long been known.  Petrarch himself says in the Solitude: "There is nothing more  vital than independence of judgement." James Harvey Robinson  evaluates this characteristic as evidencing itself in Petrarch's  desire for fame, for it is actually a part of his modernity, cleaving  him sharply, if not without pain, from the medieval lack of concern for personal glory in a span of life over-powered by eternity.  Petrarch's Secretum deals with the pain of leaving old paths; his  life the resolve of an independent spirit questing after truth.  "The charm of personal glory," as Petrarch called it in his Oration, came to him dramatically in April of 1341 when he received the laurel wreath for poetry from the Roman Senate.  The laureate must have felt that he was heir of all the ages.  His Oration upon this occasion not only demonstrates his  veneration for Roman antiquity but his acquaintance with her  poets; he leans upon them—Ennius, Lucan, Juvenal, Ovid,  Horace, Persius, and especially Virgil—to substantiate his subject: the height and difficulty of the poet's undertaking.  8   • 	asu06600000090012001							63863612 Bytes	3806	5590	3924210924	RGB	8	600	asu06600000090012001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/451	451	452.jp2	/asu0660/image/452.jp2
The Laurel Wreath					Lawrence, Natalie Grimes																											asu0660000009	Sed me Parnasi deserta per ardua dulcis/Amor  raptat.  But sweet longing urges me upward/over the  lonely slopes of Parnassus.  Petrarch immediately gives the locus of his theme: the third  book of the Georgics of the greatest and most illustrious of  poets. Few men in Petrarch's time could have had anything like  his own realization of what the steeps of Parnassus meant, for  no one climbed a mountain just to experience the height and  the view. But five years earlier, the independence of Petrarch  asserted itself, and taking his younger brother Gherardo with  him, the future laureate had with not a little difficulty ascended  the forbidding peak of Mont Ventoux, near Carpentras, where  his family had moved soon after leaving Tuscany. In a letter  to Dionigi de' Roberti of Borgo San Sepulcro, written immediately afterward, Petrarch describes the rigors of the upward climb and the fierceness of the wind at the top. Some time  before, Dionigi had given him a codex of Augustine's Confessions which Petrarch had taken with him on the trip. Opening  the book at random as he stood, almost overpowered by the  extent and detail of the view from the summit, he saw before  him these words: "Men go to admire high mountains, the vast  floods of the sea, the huge streams of the rivers, the circumference of the ocean, and the revolution of the stars—and desert  themselves." The coincidence of the words and the moment  made a profound impression on the poet so that he spoke no  word all the way down the mountain.  On September 1, 1340, Petrarch had received not only the  invitation from Rome but one from the University of Paris, as  well, to accept a laurel crown. That he chose Rome was to be  expected because of his preoccupation with her culture. The  honor of the Republic, as he avers in the coronation address,  stirred him to the heart. In the year that was at his disposal at  Vaucluse before the date of his coronation, there was plenty  of time to review the Georgics, in casting about for a theme  for his Oration. It is hard not to believe that the ascent of Mont  Ventoux informed Virgil's lines with particular meaning and  influenced Petrarch's final choice of theme. 	asu06600000090013001							64033012 Bytes	3812	5596	3864329812	RGB	8	600	asu06600000090013001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/452	452	453.jp2	/asu0660/image/453.jp2
The Laurel Wreath					Lawrence, Natalie Grimes																											asu0660000009	Ernest Hatch Wilkins has called the Oration the first manifesto of the Renaissance. Yet, in form, the address much resembled the conventional Medieval sermon, interlaced by frequent quotation from authority. Our century has been inclined  to assume that Medieval, and even Renaissance man, was content to ornament his text with bits and snatches of quotation  in blithe disregard of their context. Now, in the Secretum,  Petrarch answers St. Augustine with some quickness when accused of what amounts to such pecking and hunting: "... I cannot let that pass without saying a word. Never since I was a  boy have I pleased myself with elegant extracts and flowrets  of literature." It may be worthwhile to look at Virgil's lines surrounding Petrarch's theme.  We shall find Virgil, also, deeply concerned at the second  task that awaits him (superat par altera curae), for a little more  than halfway through his treatise on husbandry, he has been  made aware of the further duty pressing upon him, by the flight  of irreparable time. Petrarch nearing the end of his Oration,  discussing the sovereign properties of the laurel cries out ". . . in  the affairs of men, what thunderbolt is more terrible than the  diurnity of time, which consumes the works of man?" In 1341,  Petrarch was just midway through life's journey, as he, like  Dante, reckoned it. Already, the Oration tells, Petrarch knew  how toilsome is the climb to the heights and how lonely they  are; he conceives that, though the poet longs for personal glory,  yet he has an obligation also, to stimulate others to like endeavor.  At the age of thirty-seven he knows that the heights of Parnassus are still to scale. But like Virgil, he knows that although  the second task involves labor, it promises hope of fame. Like  Virgil, Petrarch does not doubt how hard it is to conquer with  words an obscure subject and thus add honor to it.  Weighing upon Petrarch must have been the Africa, the very  epic which gained him the laurel crown, though unfinished. Unfinished too was the De Viris Illustribus, that history of great  men, demanding so much research into classical sources that  Petrarch despaired of completing it. Granted that neither Scipio  Africanus, hero of the epic, nor those treated in the De Viris  need be obscure even to the schoolboy of today, Petrarch knew  that if he were to re-invoke the ancient virtu, he must go where,  10  • 	asu06600000090014001							63358136 Bytes	3793	5566	4217854618	RGB	8	600	asu06600000090014001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/453	453	454.jp2	/asu0660/image/454.jp2
The Laurel Wreath					Lawrence, Natalie Grimes																											asu0660000009	in the centuries between, was no wheel track of fore-runner.  Virgil calls upon Pales, god of shepherds, to make his words  sound with a more lofty strain (Literally; without boundary).  Petrarch seeks assurance in the belief that the poet's gift springs  from that God who may rightly be called in the words of Persius,  "Master of Arts and bestower of genius."  Fast flies meanwhile the irreparable hour  As point to point our charmed round we trace,  Enough of herds. This second task remains,  The wool-clad flocks and shaggy goats to treat.  Here lies labor; hence for glory look,  Brave husbandmen. Nor doubtfully know I  How hard it is for words to triumph here,  And shed their lustre on a theme so slight:  But I am caught by ravishing desire  Above the lone Parnassian steep; I love  To walk the heights, from whence no earlier track  Slopes gently downward to Castalia's spring.  Now, awful Pales, strike a louder tone.  (Georgics, iii, 284-294)  15  (As tr. by James Rhoades)  Poems of Virgil, 1952  To attempt a reconstruction of Petrarch's total reading of  this passage would be hazardous in the extreme; that he read  it for a deeper than surface meaning is indicated in his own  statement that "allegory is the very warp and woof of all poetry."  In the exegesis in his Oration of the two lines that form his  theme, Petrarch notes that after Virgil's mention of the toilsome ascent that the efficient cause is given in dulcis raptat  amor and is of a three-fold nature: honor of the Republic, the  charm of personal glory, and the stimulation of other men to  like endeavor. The second task then is three-fold.  The summer after the coronation, Petrarch was the guest  of Azzo da Correggio, occupying the castle of Guardasone about  twelve miles from Parma, which the Correggi controlled. High  above on a spur of the Appenines was a plateau called the  Selvapiana. One day, having climbed up to it, Petrarch, stirred  by the view of the Alps which it affords, began to pick up the  threads of the unfinished Africa. During the autumn, in a small  •   11 	asu06600000090015001							63917236 Bytes	3806	5596	2641739398	RGB	8	600	asu06600000090015001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/454	454	455.jp2	/asu0660/image/455.jp2

In his Letter to Posterity, Petrarch refers to the genesis of  the Africa as having occurred to him on Good Friday while he  was wandering about the heights near the abode of Philip of  Cabasolles, then Bishop of Cavaillon, to whom the Solitude was  later dedicated. Although the Selvapiana had quickened the  poet's creativity, the Africa remains a fragment, if a noble one.  The laureate returned to Vaucluse in the spring of 1342.  There he continued work upon the De Viris Illustribus, completed the Secretum, began the Rerum Memorandarum Libri.  Wilkins places composition, in this period, also of the Penetential  Psalms, and two of the Trionfi: The Triumph of Love and The  Triumph of Chastity. The ascent of Parnassus seems to have  been well forward by 1342-1343 so far as Petrarch himself is  concerned.  But to stimulate others to like activity was a part of his second  task. So broad has been his influence, so important to succeeding centuries that no relatively brief statement can compass it.  Within the limits of this study, there is space only to touch  upon three somewhat overlapping phases of it: his own work  springing from the classics, the interest in the honor of the  republic, and the furthering of poetry.  Close indeed to Petrarch was the second strand of the threefold efficient cause for the ascent of Parnassus: honor of the  Republic. Unlike Dante, Petrarch did not write a treatise on  the ideal form of government to simplify the task of future  critics. His ideas must be gleaned from comments in his letters,  ideals implicit in the Africa and those set forth in the De Viris  Illustribus, especially in the life of Caesar and the last completed portion, the life of Scipio. Love of country informs Italia  Mia, Canzone CXXVIII, and the Bucolicum Carmen provides  vignettes of the ideal ruler, as do Eclogue II on the death of  Robert of Sicily and Eclogue XII on the defeat, capture, and return of John II of France by Edward III of England. Nor is to be  forgotten Book II, Tractate IV of the Solitude where Petrarch  looks at his own and other times. Robert King of Sicily had  made an enduring impression upon Petrarch; one has but to  read the Metrical Epistle I, 4 to Dionigi da Borgo San Sepulcro  to learn Petrarch's conception of him, or the Familiar Letter IV,  12 •  i 	asu06600000090016001							64549856 Bytes	3832	5613	2823793960	RGB	8	600	asu06600000090016001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/455	455	456.jp2	/asu0660/image/456.jp2
The Laurel Wreath					Lawrence, Natalie Grimes																											asu0660000009	1, to Barbato da Sulmona after the report of King Robert's  death had been received in Avignon. Add to this Eclogue II of  the Bucolicum Carmen to see how beneficent the reign of Robert  seemed to Petrarch, the Ciceronian ruler, servant to his people.  Petrarch had had high hope that Cola de Rienzo might prove  to be another such leader and wrote to Francesco Nelli in 1352,  after Rienzo had been brought prisoner to the court at Avignon,  his downfall already begun:  I was enamoured of his virtue; I applauded his  design and admired his spirit. I congratulated  Italy and anticipated restoration of dominion to  the mother city and peace to the whole world.  To Petrarch the best state of a just republic is under one  emperor. Such state did not sanction tyrannical misrule, nor  did Petrarch. He preferred to emphasize its positive virtues,  but the Italy in which he lived was divided into city states,  several of them under princes who were his patrons. Hardly  could he have been unaware that tyranny was possible in the  type of government that he favored.  Coluccio Salutati in De Tyranno carries on the political beliefs of Petrarch, but asserts that to kill a tyrant ruling oppressively and without consent of the governed is justified. Salutati  defines the term tyrant as having the same meaning in Greek  times as in his own. Its origin is tyros meaning brave. He points  out that these early kings were chosen according to the judgement of good citizens, not by popularity. Their duty was defense  of the realm, just rule, and arbitration of quarrels with natural  equity. Hence, brave of body, these kings were called by the  Greeks and the early Italians, Tyrants. They were, then, the  superior man of the classics, the man of virtu.  The De Tyranno partakes of epistolary form in that it was  written in reply to a query by a young scholar; Salutati, like  Petrarch, enjoyed a wide reputation for the excellence of his  Latin epistles. In Emerton's view whatever were the leading  motives in Salutati's first appointment to the Chancellorship of  Florence, most important among them was his literary ability.  The 1388 document recording his reappointment as Chancellor  hails him as "disciple of Cicero, that fountain of eloquence" and  •   13 	asu06600000090017001							63718772 Bytes	3782	5614	3038373823	RGB	8	600	asu06600000090017001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/456	456	457.jp2	/asu0660/image/457.jp2
The Laurel Wreath					Lawrence, Natalie Grimes																											asu0660000009	extols Salutati's "extraordinary talents displayed in his letters."  Many of his letters give added evidence that Salutati followed  with verve the classic learning cherished by Petrarch.  Of those whom Petrarch influenced in his own time, Giovanni  Boccaccio most nearly fulfills that stimulation of others to the  ascent of Parnassus which Petrarch had conceived as vital to his  second task. As Salutati's epitaph addressed to Boccaccio prophesied, because of his work no age has been silent about him.  Petrarch's influence upon Boccaccio's view of poetry is directly acknowledged in his Genealogy of the Gentile Gods:  Last and greatest of my authorities is Francis  Petrarch of Florence, my revered teacher, father  and master. . . . His great eminence as a poet has  been recognized by—I will not say merely all  Italians . . . —but all France, Germany and even  that most remote corner of the world, England.  Petrarch's approach to poetry must be found in his own  poetic practice and in relevant passages from his letters and  other writings; he left no treatise upon it. Boccaccio, on the  other hand, did incorporate one in the last two books of his  compilation of myths of the pagan gods. Books XIV and XV  of the Genealogia contain his defence of poesy which he deemed  the work called for. Although written in Latin prose, Boccaccio  continually refers to it as poetry, seemingly on the ground that  it contained the subject matter of the best poetry that he knew,  that of the ancients.  The history of contemporary attitudes towards poetry shows  that the need was genuine, for in fourteenth century Italy there  still existed medieval Christian fear of an opposition to pagan  poetry, although the peak of its oppressiveness was past. Spingarn  sees such opposition as stemming from the refashioning by the  Christian Chueh of Plato's threefold rejection of poetry. During  the Middle Ages and even beyond the Renaissance, the Christian Church demurred against poetry because it was false; it  led the mind away from God toward pagan practices, and by  rousing the emotions it robbed the mind of that contemplative  calm integral to an approach to the Holy Spirit. One is reminded  of St. Augustine's agonized realization that the drama seen in  14  • 	asu06600000090018001							63874864 Bytes	3796	5607	4200434500	RGB	8	600	asu06600000090018001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/457	457	458.jp2	/asu0660/image/458.jp2
The Laurel Wreath					Lawrence, Natalie Grimes																											asu0660000009	his early days in Carthage had caused him to weep for feigned  and scenical passions, to rejoice with lovers imaginary only in  a stage play, and moved in his foolish heart to be carried full  away from God.  Petrarch and Boccaccio had not only the perception but the  courage to recognize pagan poetry for what it is. Boccaccio comments (XIV, 10) upon the lines in Virgil's Georgics: "That bees  have portions of ethereal thought/Endued with particles of  heavenly fires" that this is poetry from which "the sap of philosophy runs pure." He conceives of poetry as emanating from God,  whether it be Christian or pagan. He repeats Petrarch's phrase  (Fam X, 4) that theology is the poetry of God. Boccaccio's  definition of poetry presents both its process and its effect:  This poetry which ignorant triflers cast aside, is  a sort of fervid and exquisite invention with fervid  expression in speech and writing of that which the  mind has invented. It proceeds from the bosom  of God and few, I find, are the souls in which this  gift is born. . . . This fervor of poetry is sublime  in its effects ... it arranges these meditations in  a fixed order, adorns the whole composition with  unusual interweaving of words and thoughts, and  thus veils truth in a fair and fitting garment.  (Genealogia, XIV, 7)  Poetry is truth to each of these poets. Petrarch is more emphatic; in the Africa IX he has the poet Ennius declare that  whoever invents what he writes is neither poet nor prophet but  only a liar. Though they differ on the part of invention in poetic  strategy, each did accept the necessity of allegory, the warp  and woof of poetry. They are men of their age in that, for the  Christian Church had argued itself into a position where if it  were to admit pagan poetry, or for that matter any poetry, it  could do so only by regarding the fable as allegory. Granted  that the allegorical interpretation of Greek myth was of early  origin—as early as the Stoics or before—in western Christendom,  Fulgentius was the first in his Mythologican to set up a systematic  allegorical reading of pagan myth. Five centuries before him,  Philo Judaeus, in the first century had made such allegorical  •   15 	asu06600000090019001							63486576 Bytes	3781	5595	2321344280	RGB	8	600	asu06600000090019001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/458	458	459.jp2	/asu0660/image/459.jp2
The Laurel Wreath					Lawrence, Natalie Grimes																											asu0660000009	interpretation of the Old Testament. His method had been introduced into Western Europe by Hilary of Poitiers and Ambrose, Bishop of Milan; and Augustine, listening to Ambrose,  "resolving one or two places in the Old Testament . . . and  ofttimes In a figure'" had found himself spellbound thereby.  Both Fulgentius and St. Augustine, much used, were in Petrarch's  library, to which Boccaccio had had free access from their first  meeting in 1350. Furthermore, the acceptance of allegory for  poetry was in the air hardly to be escaped by a poet, and they  were both as Petrarch had averred of himself, prone to poetry.  What, then, if anything did Petrarch and Boccaccio contribute to the theory of poetry? The question does not readily  submit to a simple answer; but evident is the fact that to each  of them poetry presented the truth denied it by Plato and held  by the Church only for the poetry of the Old and New Testaments. As part of Ennius' response to Scipio's query concerning  poetry, Petrarch has reestablished the subject matter to include  "whatever the labor of historians, whatever the cult of virtue  and the lessons of life, whatever the study of nature" as the rightful concerns of the poet but only if these be given to the reader  under a colorful and attractive cloud to provide him with a  long and pleasing search so that the truth when found may be  the sweeter. Boccaccio's defense amply bears out his agreement  with this point of view; he specially stresses the quest for inner  meaning when he belabors stupid reading of poetry (XIV, 2).  What came about was that these two scholar-poets restored to  the Western World the validity of pagan poetry. To them the  allegory had become not so much an adjunct to religious instruction as a source of pleasure and profit to the reader, alternately hiding and revealing the truth of the poem.  Quite erroneous would it be to create an impression that  either Petrarch or Boccaccio was at war with Churchly ideals.  Devout Christians both, they rather sought to combine the  richness of two cultures, sometimes overtly in their discussions  of poetry, as in Petrarch's Bucolicum Carmen, Eclogues I, III,  IV, and X, and in Boccaccio's Genealogia, sometimes by suggestion. Petrarch's Eclogue XI, the Galatea openly combines  the two approaches in the speakers of the elegiac dialogue. They  mourn for Galatea (Laura): Niobe (Grief), obviously classic;  16  • 	asu06600000090020001							63705204 Bytes	3792	5598	1834737050	RGB	8	600	asu06600000090020001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/459	459	460.jp2	/asu0660/image/460.jp2

Olympia, Eclogue XIV of Boccaccio's Latin pastoral, attempts  to bring into harmony Christian and Virgilian symbols. Though  the attempt is somewhat labored, the poem movingly presents  the poet's wistful longing for his recently deceased five-year-old  daughter, Violante, now become, as he pointed out, Olympia,  because she is celestial. Even in the Decameron there is submerged the memory of the two cultures, the classic love of life,  the Christian awareness of mortality, for the Hundred Tales,  whatever else they contain, present that jewel life set in a frame  of death by plague.  Each of these poets is possessed of a subtle sense of tone as  a poetic device. It outweighs the somewhat incongruous imagery  of the Olympia. Petrarch gives it direct expression in the Love  Pastoral, Eclogue III. The young poet lover is trying to learn  to write so that he may win the heart of his beloved. Rejected  he flees to the forest and there encounters the Nine Muses  wandering upon the sacred mountain by the spring which was  made to gush out by a blow from the hoof of the winged horse.  The one who seems to be the leader of the Muses comforts him  and urges him to tell his Love that he has heard the Muses  sing in their different tones, different as the varied movements  of the soul.  A copy of the Genealogia Deorum Gentilium finally came  into the possession of Coluccio Salutati. It bears upon the first  page of the General Proem his coat of arms; on some of the  pages there are comments in the margin in his own beautiful  hand. Salutati himself began about 1301 a treatise on the Labors  of Hercules, the first volume of which discusses the nature of  poetry.  Petrarch's second task has, as Boccaccio said, taken him  ... to the topmost peaks of Parnassus ... He  has revived in noble spirits the hope which had  almost died, and showed that contrary to the  belief of many that the way to Parnassus is open  and its summit accessible.  The laurel wreath has neither faded nor withered.  •  17 	asu06600000090021001							64103012 Bytes	3808	5608	1721763708	RGB	8	600	asu06600000090021001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/460	460	461.jp2	/asu0660/image/461.jp2
Book Haven																																asu0660000009	Book Haven  I have the 1860 edition of Leaves of Grass. A large snail is  embossed on the cloth cover, no doubt at the suggestion of that  idler, Walt Whitman. The steel-engraved frontispiece shows  Walt in his middle years, short beard frizzy with vitality, eyes  not yet saddened by the nursing years in military hospitals and  the death of Lincoln. The title page is in Spencerian sweeps  and curleques: Boston, Thayer and Eldridge, year 85 of the  States.  Walt's fussy desire to set off his poems with pictorial embroidery appears in the choice of line drawings—the butterfly  poised on a hand, the elaborate tailpiece scrolls and outlined  initials. He probably also chose the font, peering over the typesetter's shoulder and insisting that the lines be generously leaded  out.  I prefer reading the Thayer and Eldridge to any other edition.  I bought it in a Fourth Avenue second-hand bookstore in the  Twenties. No book I have ever owned has had the re-readings I  gave this one. I am still moved by the exuberant hodge-podge  of Walt's barbaric yawp:  I will not have a single person slighted or left  away, The kept-woman, sponger, thief, are hereby invited . . . This is the press of a bashful  hand—this is the float and odor of hair, This is  the touch of my lips to yours—this is the murmur  of yearning . . .

I took the Thayer and Eldridge off the shelf this evening and  found the spine broken and mold spots on some pages.

His wood-engraving of a medieval printing  house has appeared as a front cover of The Carrell.  The hand-set type is from Mr. Merrick's own font.  Its charter pledges the Friends of the University of  Miami Library: "to add special materials for scholarly research to the Library's collection . . . and to  carry to the whole community the great tradition  and enobling force of letters."  Because the Richter Library needs community support, the Friends have printed a supply of Mr. Merrick's bookplate to place on the inside front cover  of every rare book given to the Library, with the  donor's name inscribed on it.

Remarks, Pertinent and Impertinent					Barker, Virgil, 1890-																											asu0660000009	REMARKS,  PERTINENT AND IMPERTINENT  By Virgil Barker  SINCE MINE is only a marginal mind, I've spent most of  my writing-time in making notes suggested by the productions of other minds. Yet even in such notes the kind  of writer I am has been able to function and, with the good luck  of living long, to find—or perhaps make—a self.  In doing that I have of course set down a great deal that I merely  thought I thought, so that what I'm now sure I think has only  gradually emerged in the course of an interior dialogue carried  on between me and my successive selves through years of note-  making. As a would-be author I've had to work by minute accumulations and to achieve my few completed things through  a sea of scribbled scraps.  Being thus temperamentally conditioned, my hope now is simply  to put together a small book of notations like these on a lot of  matters that still interest me; but I suspect that I shall want to  follow that book with another—one of annotations on my own  notations, to be called What I Meant To Say.  Many youths have had an ambition to establish a new set of  ideas in some area of thinking, and in middle age most of them  have settled for fragmentary comments. Maybe old age ought to  fall silent. Yet just as old age is a footnote to living, so an aging  writer may manage to keep on writing if he is content to dwindle  into annotations.  I'm reckless enough to have opinions about almost everything,  but I'm also cautious enough to hold convictions about very  few things. Opinions can be altered with good grace upon more  knowledge and experience, but convictions have to be maintained  even against odds. However, I'm willing to fight for the luxury  of having few convictions; so I can't be convicted of having none.  A writer's punctuation is like a pianist's pedaling, and it requires  20 • 	asu06600000090026001							63927732 Bytes	3803	5600	2322135713	RGB	8	600	asu06600000090026001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/465	465	466.jp2	/asu0660/image/466.jp2
Remarks, Pertinent and Impertinent					Barker, Virgil, 1890-																											asu0660000009	an almost professional perceptiveness to appreciate either when  it is well done.  Maybe my real reason for disbelieving in the efficacy of argument is that I'm not good at it. Also, what I do believe I believe  largely on instinct. Argumentative reasons for believing, no matter how sound, always come too late; I've already been persuaded. But of course I'm always glad to learn why I've been  right all along.  People commend a novel or a short story for being life-like,  and intend that as praise. That is only their way of saying they  think it believable in terms of what they already know about  life, and about life nobody ever knows enough.  Commendation becomes significant when people say that some  person or some event is like something out of a book. That  means they have felt the impact of literature as an art, being  sensitized by it to where they can put more meaning into life —  and thus get more out of it.  Thirty-five years ago I chose to live in the provinces rather than  at the center of contemporary american culture, and now I know  I've become genuinely provincial because I feel so greedy for  city sensations.  Nowadays a bookworm is permanently unhappy because every  year he must let a thousand books disappear into the library  stacks unread.  As I grow older I read less poetry, but some of that less is in  the pages of The Times Literary Supplement, out of London.  There I find that even the english no longer cry 'Ah!' or sigh  'Alas!'  Therefore, in elegy for an immense number of poems I once  read and am glad to have forgotten, I wish to cry an 'Ah!' and  to sigh one more 'Alas!'  Indivisibility: there's a seven-syllable word with only one vowel  sound. Were I a poet, what a find!  • 21 	asu06600000090027001							63889616 Bytes	3813	5582	695557900	RGB	8	600	asu06600000090027001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/466	466	467.jp2	/asu0660/image/467.jp2
Remarks, Pertinent and Impertinent					Barker, Virgil, 1890-																											asu0660000009	Through several years William Hard and I had several conversations about our respective 'works in progress'. In that respect  at least, even if in that only, we were in the company of James  Joyce. Mine was a long book that was continually getting longer;  he had five going simultaneously, and they were getting longer  too. He said it was because he kept finding new facts. I said my  own trouble was not new facts but new ideas, or at least new  aspects of old ones. He took it from there:  "When you start writing, stop thinking."  Youth poses and re-poses and poses yet again but never attains  repose.  Now more than ever do I find it dangerous to open the dictionary; every page has on it so many other definitions to distract  me from the one I may be hunting out. Merely glancing aside  is to become entangled in unsolvable problems of language and  life: scientific, religious, esthetic; logical and illogical, a-logical  and analogical. There's not time enough left to me in which to  get happily lost in words any more, and I never had the presumption of Humpty Dumpty to make a word mean "just what I  choose it to mean."  Not many writers can go off by themselves and make their own  words, like James Joyce. Perhaps even fewer can disregard the  ordinary meanings of ordinary words and still compel them into  private incantations, like Gertrude Stein. Yet every real writer  is a man of words; and his difficult business is to discover, among  the monstrous multitude of everybody's words, his own.  Thoreau thought of the stars as being apexes for triangles of  contemplation with human beings at the other corners. That can  be characterized as thinking in terms of plane geometry.  Actually flying in an airplane at eighteen thousand feet puts  one at the apex of a cone of sight. That compels one to think  in terms of solid geometry, even if the solid involved is space —  mostly empty.  Hope springs eternal in every dog's tail.  22  • 	asu06600000090028001							63149216 Bytes	3769	5583	2875532984	RGB	8	600	asu06600000090028001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/467	467	468.jp2	/asu0660/image/468.jp2
Recent Gifts and Acquisitions																																asu0660000009	Because I want history to be factually accurate and the biography  of those who made it to be psychologically true, I have a particular aversion to historical fiction. Besides, in most of the  books that claim to be histories and biographies I find such a  high proportion of fiction that it's unnecessary to go farther in  search of more.  An author's way of making himself a part of things begins with  his standing away and apart.  The great paintings and the great sculptures carry within them  or around them the look of those interior spaces of the mind  wherein they took shape.  Likewise do the words that rise into literature reverberate  with the sound of the silence out of which they came.  Recent Gifts and Acquisitions  Cuba.

I: Brave New DNA					Greer, Sheldon																											asu0660000007	THE  CARRE LL  Volume 4 June, 1963 Number 1  FOUR VIEWS OF DNA  Recent genetic and biochemical breakthroughs have led  responsible scientists to predict eventual control by man  of his own heredity. The nature of the involved agent,  DNA; an account of a controlled society among insects;  and speculations on the impact of DNA on human society  appear in the following four related articles; written by a  geneticist, a Dean whose discipline is zoology, a sociologist,  and an undisciplined editor.  I: Brave New DNA  By Sheldon Greer  WHAT IS A GENE? While many laboratories, including my own, are concerned with the nature and  extent of the gene, I find it of interest to reflect on  the nature and scope of the genetecist. What is a genetecist? He  is an individual concerned with Evolution, which is the leit  motif of all biological studies. He has an intellectual (not merely  emotional) concern with the fate of man's genes and considers  his own individual genes only as part of a vast pool; therefore,  the fate of his genes is intimately interwoven with the fate of  the genes of all men. This concern prompts him to look beyond  the reality of this month's Proc. Nat. Acad, of Science or /. Biol.  Chem. to discoveries and generations from now, when the most 	asu06600000070003001							70000408 Bytes	4035	5781	1573407708	RGB	8	600	asu06600000070003001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/475	475	476.jp2	/asu0660/image/476.jp2

Within the past ten years, Genetics and Nucleic Acid Chemistry have enjoyed a Golden Age, indeed. The structure of  the chemical that comprises our hereditary material has been  established. DNA is soon becoming a household word (to the  consternation of this writer who prefers the good old esoteric  days). Deoxyribonucleic Acid has been studied so extensively in  this period, that it is not a matter of reckless speculation to extrapolate from the current rate of discovery to discoveries that  will lead to specific control of our hereditary destiny.  In the past two years, brilliant experiments have resulted in  determining the triplet code of building blocks (nucleotides) in  this polymer (consisting of 10,000 nucleotides) which determines in turn the sequence of the building blocks (amino acids)  in a protein. The properties of enzymes as well as structural  proteins are determined in larger part by the sequence of constituent amino acids; therefore, it follows that the properties of a  cell, which are a reflection of their enzymatic content and  arrangement of structural protein, are related to the sequence of  nucleotide-building blocks  in DNA.  DNA functions by directing the synthesis of a similar nucleic  acid called messenger or template RNA. This chemical, carrying  the genetic code, delivers the message to particles in the cell  cytoplasm called ribosomes which are concerned with the  synthesis of protein. This takes place when amino acids attached  to a small molecule of RNA, called transfer RNA, are trans-  fered to the ribosome—the factory of protein synthesis. At this  rendezvous at the ribosome; the transfer RNA (with its attached  amino acids) recognizes specific sequences in the messenger  RNA, so that a particular and intelligent protein is made. This  is the essence of the hereditary mechanism. (If you haven't held  a test tube since your campus days, you may re-read this last  paragraph).  It is possible to inactivate certain genes in DNA specifically;  in addition, cells including human tissue culture cells can be  shown to take up DNA and are modified in a hereditary fashion  as a consequence. Furthermore, it has recently been possible to  form hybrid molecules of DNA by separating the two helical  •2 	asu06600000070004001							69374652 Bytes	3976	5813	1804380689	RGB	8	600	asu06600000070004001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/476	476	477.jp2	/asu0660/image/477.jp2

We must also consider the following apparently  unrelated experiments which have been performed with some  success:  a) DNA molecules can be fractionated by various  physical means so that specific molecules carrying only  certain genetic information can be selected.  b) Fertilization of the human ovum can take place in  a finger bowl.  c) Naked nucleic acid of viruses carrying genetic information to the cell in addition to that necessary for  its own synthesis, can infect human cells in tissue  culture.  One may predict then, that heredity will be controlled in two  general ways. One process would have as its basis the fractionation of sperm cells carrying specific hereditary information, the  other would depend on the specific inactivation and fractionation  of genes in hereditary nucleic acid. Non hereditary control may  occur in the future by the addition of messenger RNA to zygotes  undergoing differentiation. As yet the entrance of infective DNA  into an egg cell has not been demonstrated; however, many  laboratories are now investigating the mechanism of entry of  the large molecule of DNA into bacterial cells; therefore, it is  not unlikely that once this mechanism is understood, DNA entry  into other cells may be possible.  The hybrid experiments suggest that an individual with the  genius and wit of Bernard Shaw and the beauty of the actress  to whom he wrote may yet be assured with greater certainty.  Although we are far away from these results, empirically, and  much further away from comprehending and accepting the moral,  social, and religious responsibilities, we must recognize the fact  that the Brave New World is coming, it is possible, it may be  closer to us than the moon (Venus would be a better choice)  and if you are lucky, barring any cataclysmic suicide by man's  newly found powers and developments, some of your genes  will be there. 	asu06600000070005001							69023500 Bytes	3969	5795	3940649170	RGB	8	600	asu06600000070005001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/477	477	478.jp2	/asu0660/image/478.jp2
II: Life in a Termite City					Miller, E. Morton																											asu0660000007	II: Life in a Termite City  By E. Morton Miller  FIFTY MILLION years ago, or thereabouts, evolutionary  processes had already produced insects whose fossils so  closely resemble certain present-day termites that we have  come to suppose that they were even then organized into societies  as remarkable as the termite colonies known today. Such antiquity and persistence deserve attention, especially since as  individuals these soft-bodied, pallid, generally blind creatures  seem quite unfitted for survival in a harsh world.  Nearly two thousand species of termites have been discovered  around the world. Most of these are distributed in the tropical  and neotropical climates, but a few varieties may be found in  temperate sites as far north as France, Japan, Massachusetts, and  Oregon. Their community populations may be as small as a  few dozen or as large as three million. Depending upon species,  their abodes may be loosely underground, in mortared mounds  fifteen feet tall, in fragile, apartmented arboreal nests, or primitively carved within dry, dead tree branches; they even may  be within a veneered piano, unaccustomed as they are to distinguishing between a human's prized household cellulose and  that standing in forests.  From the morphologist's and evolutionist's viewpoint, the  order Isoptera is divided into five families, of which the most  primitive is confined to Australia. The others are more widely  distributed but the evolutionarily most advanced group is chiefly  represented in the tropics. Roughly parallel with their structurally-based genealogy, termite groups show increasing complexity  of societal organization; that is, those closest to their roach-like  ancestral stem have the simplest behavioral relationships and,  consequently, the simplest colonies.  For a beginning description of typical colony organization  one of the thirteen species inhabiting Florida will serve: the  furniture termite, Cryptotermes brevis, may first be seen as a  light-brown, four-winged, half-inch-long insect flying within  buildings in late March or in April. Such forms are the imagos  or reproductively mature individuals of both sexes, and after  short flights they pair and seek niches in which to live, produce  •4 	asu06600000070006001							69535140 Bytes	3984	5816	1960840689	RGB	8	600	asu06600000070006001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/478	478	479.jp2	/asu0660/image/479.jp2

These progenitors of a new  dynasty are sometimes called "king" and "queen" by the poetic-  minded. To the extent that they are the organization center of  the colony and exert certain regulatory influences on the population this terminology is correct. Eggs hatch after ten days or two  weeks into minute nymphs which must be fed by regurgitation  from the adults. After a growth period each nymph moults its  skin, becomes a "second stage" nymph, and begins to feed itself,  although never abandoning entirely its solicitation of juices from  both older and contemporary individuals.  One growth-stage follows another, producing larger and larger  nymphs which gradually approach their parents' form but which  lack pigment while living in their darkened, extending galleries.  Nymphs of all stages except the first participate in gallery excavation as the population increases slowly. After a dozen or  so young termites have appeared, however, the observer is startled to find one or two individuals with enlarged, pigmented  heads and elongated mandibles. Such forms are the soldiers,  appropriately named since this type is armored and armed, with  a behavior pattern of defense against aggressor insects (usually  ants) which may broach the gallery walls.  This sort of population development leads to a "caste" system  and a division of labor within the colony: the immature forms,  sometimes called "workers," concerned with enlargement and  care of the galleries, and with feeding; the soldiers, for defense  only (they cannot tunnel nor feed themselves); and finally the  king and queen, dealated and increasingly dependent upon care  by the workers, but accelerating in reproductive rate.  If one looks further among the species in the world numerous  variations from the basic societal plan just described may be  found. Some kinds of termites produce enormous colonies, which  generally have an enlarged imprisoned queen producing thousands of eggs per day. Some types have great numbers of "permanent" workers; others have temporary workers. In various  species there are soldiers armed with long, biting jaws, with  plug-like heads, or with a tiny, nozzle-like head projection from  which a noxious gas or sticky fluid may emerge for the colony's  defense. There are species which construct huge, palmate towers  of cemented earth oriented always with the broad faces east and 	asu06600000070007001							70915308 Bytes	4075	5799	145900188	RGB	8	600	asu06600000070007001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/479	479	480.jp2	/asu0660/image/480.jp2
II: Life in a Termite City					Miller, E. Morton																											asu0660000007	west; there are others which construct intricate capsules underground, with galleries and air vents so regularly and characteristically patterned that an expert can identify the species  without seeing more than the nest. And some seem satisfied with  merely eating their way randomly through timber to form passages in which the population can move and have its being.  Diversity is also found in the feeding habits of termites when  one takes a world overview of the group. The more primitive  types feed directly on wood, some on damp wood, others on  exceedingly dry cellulose; that the essential foodstuff is cellulose  is evidenced by the adequacy with which filter paper (or even  an old copy of the Saturday Evening Post) seems to serve their  needs. But the wood-eating forms have to have digestive aid of  a population of protozoa living within their intestines. This is a  remarkable symbiotic relationship of long evolutionary standing.  Thus, the word termite should conjure up thoughts far beyond  an automatic image of exterminators. And, of course, the picture  is one of discrete populations, organized into colonies and communities, a division of labor within each city, a regulation of  relative numbers of the castes, and an overall directive activity  that produces in some cases an architecture of surprising regularity and specificity.  Now it is a basic principle that organization and regulation  require communication of some sort among the elements of the  organism.  How is this achieved in termite colonies? Our knowledge, although incomplete, suggests that members of a termite colony  relate to each other by the exchange of chemotropic secretions  and by meaningful vibrations of their antennae and bodies; they  relate and react to their physical environment through detection  of odors, light, humidity, and textures, and by responding in  hereditarily-endowed behavior patterns. The society is held  together in a network of dependent relationships. Thus a termite  colony may well be thought of as a "supra-organism," with many  of its properties analogous to those of the parts of a single,  better-known organism such as a jellyfish.  An example of the remarkable regulatory effect of these  chemical exchanges is seen in the phenomenon of caste regulation. Each beginning city-colony has only one pair of functioning 	asu06600000070008001							68389396 Bytes	3940	5784	2214185033	RGB	8	600	asu06600000070008001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/480	480	481.jp2	/asu0660/image/481.jp2
II: Life in a Termite City					Miller, E. Morton																											asu0660000007	reproductives — the "king and queen"; no others develop; all  other individuals are functionally sterile. But if death of one of  the reproductives occurs, one or more of the nymphs of the  colony slowly begins to develop reproductive abilities and concomitantly certain structural and pigmented changes. Such an  individual is a supplementary reproductive. A similar phenomenon may be demonstrated in experimental colonies by removing the characteristic number of soldiers.  It appears that both reproductive castes and adult soldiers  produce specific, inhibiting ectohormones which, when communicated in sufficient concentration to the immature nymphs  of the colony, serve to prevent nymph development into these  castes: the ectohormone from a soldier inhibits additional soldiers; the hormone from a reproductive inhibits other reproductives. The immature forms have developmental capacities not  realized until they are removed from the influence or sphere of  the functioning soldiers or reproductives, as the case may be.  Experimental colonies started with abnormal numbers of any  caste slowly undergo a ^differentiation, a reorganization of  elements to produce the necessary proportions of castes and a  proper division of labor within the colony. The chemical coordination system works inevitably because of the compulsive exchange of secretions, the "trophallaxis," amongst all members.  The beautiful but rather relentless efficacy of such a system  has only begun to be understood in these insects of ancient heritage. And as the organization and nature of a termite city have  become better known, striking yet satisfying central organizational themes appear that are similar to those found at other  levels of organization of living matter. The individuals of a  colony, although moving about freely, are nevertheless coordinated in group living, and remind us, in their distinctive  functions and their regulatory response to hormones, of the  cells comprising tissues in single organisms; hence the application  of the term "supraorganism" — a second level organism — to  these insect cities.  Zoological philosophers tend to believe, too, that the natural  selection processes of evolution have operated at the termite  colony level rather than solely upon single individuals, and this  belief has interesting implications. 	asu06600000070009001							65858564 Bytes	3891	5640	4155682167	RGB	8	600	asu06600000070009001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/481	481	482.jp2	/asu0660/image/482.jp2
III: DNA: Curse or Boon					Carroll, Thomas E.																											asu0660000007	Ill: DNA: Curse or Boon  By Thomas E. Carroll  RECENT ADVANCES in molecular genetics, most  notably the discovery of DNA, clearly point towards  man's ability to control his own future heredity.  Although this possibility is still in the distant future, the complex  moral and political problems which is poses must be faced and  debated now. Scientific technology has a tendency of surpassing  man's capacity for adjusting to it. Man must be ready with a  considered judgment when the moment of decision arrives.  The basic problem is twofold. "Who shall control it and for  what ends shall it be utilized?" In the contemporary world it is  inevitable that a scientific discovery of such moment will be  controlled. The supposition that the laissez-faire approach, in  which parents alone will determine the traits of future offspring,  will be utilized is sociologically naive. Any basic discovery, be  it fire, the A-bomb, or DNA, which affects the basic interests  of the community will be controlled by that community.  The major hazard is not that the scientists involved will  misuse these techniques for personal aggrandizement. In the  main, scientists adhere to a professional code of ethics, much as  do doctors and lawyers. The real threat to democratic forms of  social organization will arise when control of the techniques for  manipulating human heredity is assumed by non-scientific social  groupings.  The dominant viewpoint of scientists is that the major purpose  of science is the discovery of knowledge and the codification  and systematization of previously existing knowledge. Science  is amoral and is not concerned with morality, since the latter  is subjective and therefore outside the sphere of concern of a  true scientist. Scientists are thus mainly concerned with the  advance of their discipline and have strongly tended to ignore  the uses to which their discoveries are put. The majority of  scientists engaged in splitting the atom only became concerned  after their discovery had been utilized to incinerate thousands  of innocent civilians at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Many scientists  in this area are still unconcerned. Scientists have seemingly  • 8 	asu06600000070010001							65874404 Bytes	3853	5697	1303951318	RGB	8	600	asu06600000070010001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/482	482	483.jp2	/asu0660/image/483.jp2
III: DNA: Curse or Boon					Carroll, Thomas E.																											asu0660000007	been willing to work for any group able to pay their salaries  and to provide facilities for work. In short, scientists have  willingly served the purposes, whatever they were, of the power  groups within society. The assumption that the scientists working  on DNA will be different than other scientific groups is tenuous  indeed. It ignores past experience; it will not withstand the harsh  scrutiny of reality.  The ultimate decision with respect to the use of DNA will  almost certainly be made in the political sphere of each society.  Thus the groups possessing the power within each society will  make this basic decision, and they will utilize the coercive power  of the state to enforce that decision. Within U.S. society what  will probably be the criteria utilized by our power groups?  Assume that the power groups were motivated by the best of  intentions and were altruistically disposed. Thus the major  criterion would be the selection of "socially desirable" or "superior" traits to be fostered in future generations. Inevitably, superior "traits" come to be those traits characteristic of the already  successful, the elite; this is because the elite is the model of  success and hence already possess the "socially desirable" traits.  To anticipate any other result would be to assume that a social  group can at will transcend its cultural limitations, an unlikely  sociological occurrence. The danger of this are manifold; it  would lead to a self-perpetuating elite and the elimination of  "undesirable" traits, largely those associated with minorities.  The most striking quality associated with social desirability in  the U.S. today is skin color. Despite the rheotoric of equality and  freedom, deep strains of racial prejudice permeate much of our  social structure. If the content of our political life, our movies, or  even of the readers used in public education, are analyzed  objectively they would lead almost inevitably to the conclusion  that Americans are light-skinned, fair-haired and have blue eyes.  Americans tend to prefer light colored skin to darker shades  (even Negroes, having assimilated dominant values, evince the  same tendency). In a prejudice-ridden society like that of the  United States, it is extremely unlikely that Negroes, Puerto  Ricans, Jews, and Catholics from southern and eastern Europe,  would be well represented numerically in such a future society.  A second criterion which might conceivably be utilized by the 	asu06600000070011001							66400968 Bytes	3892	5685	4064344871	RGB	8	600	asu06600000070011001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/483	483	484.jp2	/asu0660/image/484.jp2
III: DNA: Curse or Boon					Carroll, Thomas E.																											asu0660000007	power groups of the future would be the elimination of the  "unfit". The problem here involves the definition of "unfit".  "Unfit for what?" "Unfit from what viewpoint?" The answers to  these and similar questions are by no means apparent since there  is so little consensus about the meaning of the term. The likely  response would ultimately be dependent upon what the dominant  considerations of the power groups would be.  There appears to be a strong tendency for the groups in power  to be conservative, to be oriented toward the status quo in order  to protect their social prestige and/or power. The powerful  generally desire peace since they are satisfied and have no  greater desire than to be left alone to enjoy the spoils of conquest  or of heredity (having a wealthy ancestor). It is generally the  impoverished who are aggressive and warlike since they have  "nothing to lose but their chains". On the other hand, this is a  period in world history of pervasive social unrest and tension  frequently resulting in social upheavals and revolutions. Given  present trends, it seems probably that the symptoms and consequences of social unrest will continue to multiply around the  world in the future.  Since the position of the powerful is increasingly threatened  by the dominant trends of today, it seems plausible that they  would utilize whatever strategems were available in the attempt  to consolidate their position and stave off disaster. It would be  difficult to conceive of a device more helpful in this effort than  future control over man's heredity. Through such techniques it  would be feasible to eliminate threats to the future stability of  the then extant power structure by "breeding" out of man those  traits making for instability and unrest.  Under such conditions, traits such as timidity, docility, sub-  missiveness, stolidity, and insensitivity would become "desirable"  since they encourage an individual to adjust himself to the  status quo, however unsatisfactory it may be. These traits would  probably make revolt impossible since subjective feelings of  dissatisfaction and injustice are probably necessary for change  to occur. Thus the legitimacy of the then-current social structure  would be accepted by the majority of citizens and social stability  would be assured. The currents of social change now sweeping  the world would be stalemated by the simple device of creating  • 10 	asu06600000070012001							64505472 Bytes	3809	5643	658785011	RGB	8	600	asu06600000070012001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/484	484	485.jp2	/asu0660/image/485.jp2
III: DNA: Curse or Boon					Carroll, Thomas E.																											asu0660000007	masses of humans with built-in propensities for docility.  A society based on the above principles would be more stable  and unchanging than the caste systems have been over a period  of time in India and Ceylon. Carried to its logical extreme, it  would resemble more a colony of termites or bees than any  known human civilization since it would be based on the same  kind of biological determinism. A tentative outline of the social  structure of such a hypothetical society follows.  Group I: A small ruling elite at the peak of the structure.  They would possess "drive," "ambition," "choice," and be fully  capable of directing themselves and the rest of society. They  would possess all the traits and characteristics which we presently  associate with our current image of the "ideal" human.  Group II: A somewhat larger cohort of individuals who will  act as supervisors and lower level "executives" who transmit and  implement elite decisions. Their primary task will be to insure  domestic tranquility and peace by supervising the "drones" and  reporting any sign of unrest to their supervisors. (It is likely that  through a combination of chance and incompetence that mistakes  will be made and that individuals at the bottom of the social  pyramid may be born with certain types of sensitivity which are  supposed to be characteristic only of the elite).  Group HI: This is the lowest level of society composed of the  great mass of mankind. These individuals ("drones") are inherently phlegmatic and obedient to the commands of their supervisors. They are incapable of resistance or of self-direction. They  are deprived of all sensitivity and those qualities which we now  regard as inherently human. Their major task is to perform the  rudimentary and most basic social tasks.  The foregoing description of a hypothetical society would  probably now arouse loathing and dread in the breasts of the  majority of Americans. However, there is substantial empirical  evidence that in "the flight for security" so characteristic of our  "age of anxiety" large numbers of Americans see nothing inherently wrong and, in fact have already accepted, the basic principle  of an all-seeing and beneficient power. (I have frequently asked  my college classes "What's wrong with Huxley's Brave New  World?" The most characteristic response is "nothing".) Apparently the idea of creating a human being with dulled sensitivi-  • 11 	asu06600000070013001							66013124 Bytes	3872	5681	659711933	RGB	8	600	asu06600000070013001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/485	485	486.jp2	/asu0660/image/486.jp2
III: DNA: Curse or Boon					Carroll, Thomas E.																											asu0660000007	ties and limited capacities for pain and pleasure has great popular  allure. This is the "escape from freedom" so frequently noted by  students of modern industrial societies.  The foregoing discussion has even greater relevance when it  is considered in the context of the current struggle for power on  a world scale (The "Cold War" and The "Revolution of Rising  Expectations".) The great majority of the world's population  lives in the underdeveloped countries which are desperately  attempting to raise their levels of living. These countries are  attempting to accomplish in a brief span of time a task which took  Western societies several centuries. Their task is complicated by  the "population explosion", illiterate populations, combined with  the fact that their natural resources are owned by foreign  investors. The primary concern of the latter is immediate profit;  they are not particularly concerned with helping the underdeveloped areas to build a thriving industrial economy.  The attempt to hasten industrialization creates monumental  hardships and bitterness in the underdeveloped areas. The extraction of capital to build an industrial base for the future is an  extremely painful process and inevitably requires coercion and,  in many instances, brute force. Contemporary history is replete  with examples of societies attempting revolutionary change which  have faltered on the bedrock of dissatisfaction.  In such societies, even erstwhile benevolent political leaders  might be persuaded to utilize the control of human heredity to  smooth the path to industrialization of their society, to insure  success of the revolution. In this instance, it might be reasoned  that the ends, a higher level of individual living and industrialization, are justified by the means, the breeding of docility and  submission and eliminating the "misfits".  The greatest threat will come from societies which do not  cherish democratic values and which would be willing to use  hereditary controls to harness and direct the energies of their  populations. Such societies would possess manifold advantages  in the production of industrial goods. It is probable that even  erstwhile democratic societies, like the United States, would be  forced to emulate them in order to survive. This is particularly  likely when it is recalled that under the present system, the  industrial efficiency of U.S. society even under conditions of  • 12 	asu06600000070014001							65010752 Bytes	3828	5659	3110082747	RGB	8	600	asu06600000070014001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/486	486	487.jp2	/asu0660/image/487.jp2

"If they do and we do, how will we  differ from them?"  The foregoing has been at attempt to delineate some of the  possible consequences arising out of the possible control of man's  heredity. DNA is a symbol we ignore only at the peril of losing  those democratic and humane values which we so rightly cherish.  Today is not too soon for Americans and the world to consider  what they want to accomplish with this scientific breakthrough.

This our present period of peril  seems a fitting one in which to assay DNA's first century.  The benefits of the Era of Biology are well known. Those of  you who are fourth or fifth generation DNA inheritors may smile  your 200-plus I.Q. smiles at my simple-minded recapitulation.  As a Delegate from Africa I may be suspect of under-dog proclivities, since my Continent still ranks lowest in numbers of  DNA inheritors. To this I demur. I speak as Secretary General  of the United Nations, out of knowledge that DNA superiority  has not solved all of the world's social maladies. Else why are  we here?  These, then, are the historical milestones which mankind has  followed to reach our own clear and present danger:  Practical use of atomic fission, at a Japanese city called  Hiroshima, preceded the breaking of the genetics code by twenty  years. In their obsession with potential atomic destruction, the  people of 1963 remained lethargic over the possibilities in the  genetic engineering of human beings. It was at best (they  thought) merely an improvement on a hit-or-miss eugenics whose  brief vogue had ended. Interest likewise waned when it appeared  that living human beings would not be affected, and that it would  require one hundred years to produce five DNA generations.  This, in the face of imminent anihilation by generic's counterpart  in the field of physics, the atom, seemed too long to await  biological results. In addition, religious scruples and mating  mores at first balked at lending men and women to biological  experiments which were proved in the laboratory but not in life.  Animals, owning no such choice in the matter, bestowed their  mating instincts on the first controlled genetic experiments. The  rabbit, which produces twenty generations while humans are  producing one, was bred to the size of a large dog without  impairment of its flavor and texture in the stewpot. The decade  of the 1970s produced many such improved animals and added  enormously to the world's food supply. Beef cattle, immune to  ticks, owning skin muscles to flick flies away, resistant to heat  and cold, having no cuts inferior to the best sirloin, were able  to range both the Arctic and the Antarctic tundras to the very  edge of the ice caps. Comparable advances were made in fresh  • 14  i 	asu06600000070016001							65327020 Bytes	3848	5657	2507174445	RGB	8	600	asu06600000070016001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/488	488	489.jp2	/asu0660/image/489.jp2

That birds were kept exempt from genetic changes, a fact  we unthinkingly accept today, came about (according to recent  Harvard researches) through the efforts of two widely disparate  pressure groups. Sportsmen discovered that the genetic engineering of quail, grouse, pheasant and duck made them too fat  to fly and of no further interest as a wing-shot. The World  Audubon Society drew vast numbers of adherents from among  those who disapproved of any tampering with nature, and made  their resentment stick in the case of birds.  The World Kennel Club has, of course, had a like ameliorating control over the genetic breeding of registered dogs; not,  however, before the rampant changes of the 1970s had created  breeds familiar to us as our house pets but hitherto unknown.  The short-coupled dachshund dates from that uncontrolled  breeding period, as does the useful saddle-dog and the frivolous  two-ounce Chihuahua. Pictures dating from the late 20th Century  show lion-hounds bred as large as their intended quarry, and  become so dangerous to man that they were DNA reversed.  The demonstrable results in the animal world undoubtedly  stimulated the first human genetic engineering, perhaps as early  as the 1970s when a vestigial modesty still cloaked genetic  mating in secrecy. Today's fifth generation DNA inheritors owe  their being to such private ventures of their ancestors. The  success with animals, together with the need for missile pilots  with endurance and intelligence surpassing that of any man born  prior to the Biological Era, brought control of heredity out into  the open during the 1980s. The rapidity with which nation after  nation adopted and encouraged heredity control at the turn of  the 21st Century needs your attention now, as its results need  your succour of a world in crisis.  By the year 2010 the beneficient effects of controlled hereditary were amply apparent and its techniques were known to the  biochemists of every Continent. Acrimony over charges of  espionage in obtaining the techniques faded in the general joy  with which mankind greeted this world solvent of inferiority.

England  strove for an imperturable stolidity, France for intellectual  subtlety, Russia for athletic prowess and interplanetary travel  physiques, Africa for a complex of Arabic mathematical genius  and the endurance of native stock, South America for a contemporary adaptation of conquistadore qualities, the U.S.A.  for beauty in her women and stamina in her men. China alone  chose to imitate the social system of the ants and termites, with  the disastrous results to her elite of which we are well aware  In preparation for addressing you, I requested our research  department to gather data on the motivations impelling the  choices of characteristics sought through genetic control, and  to reduce these to world figures in percentages. I trust they will  be sufficiently illuminating to justify the time and devotion spent  in gathering them.  Stamina and scientific intelligence lead the list of desired traits  with 47 percent. These two qualities were linked together, not so  much as a statistical choice, but because they reflect the need for  men and women able to withstand high gravity pressures, acquire  relative radiation immunity, and still perform the calculating  maneuvers required in inter-planetary flight. Athletic prowess  also enters here, with an eye to national prestige at stake in the  Olympic Games.  Sound health and longevity (also related qualities) came  second with 22 percent.  Fertility (I regret to report in view of current conditions)  scored 13 percent, a reflection of the desires of those peoples  in already over-populated areas where, one might suppose, they  need this quality least.  Physical beauty 8 percent.  Courage 5 percent.  Creative ability 2 percent.  Sanctity 2 percent.  Humility, white skin, dark skin, courteous bearing: traces of  one percent each.  Quite obviously, no isolated characteristic can be had without  qualifying side qualities. I cite these percentages as a guide to  predominant desires.

It reviews the  case of Mainland China where the dominance of a few elite  DNA inheritors imposed helot qualities on the mass of this  people, with the consequent rebellion of the mid-2050s, the  wiping out of the elite and the rapine and starvation among a  leaderless people which, in terms of geopolitics at least, benefitted  a too populous world by the deaths of a fourth of its inhabitants.  All Member nations of this body, from the beginning, eschewed involuntary breeding. By 1990 when the value of DNA  was apparent, the numbers of applicants was sufficient to make  attempts of involuntary genetics moot. The only alleged recourse  to unethical breeding arose from resentment at the shattering of  17 world records by the Russian team in the 2004 Olympic  Games. The charges were dropped during the compromise of  2006 which resulted in the U.N. Compact pledging Member  nations to make DNA techniques available to all ethnic and  racial groups within their jurisdictions.  The "Fortunate Forties", as that decade now a score of years  behind us came to be known, enjoyed world stability. Atomic  weapons were held in leash by fears of retaliation (and parenthetically by the good offices of the United Nations). The  improved food supply had kept pace with increasing population.  Inter-cultural exchanges and the multiplication of DNA inheritors  seemed to have scotched the bitter nationalism which characterized the 20th Century. The blow, I need not remind you, came  from the success of two humane projects—the final cures for  malaria and cancer.  The population explosion significantly occurred in those  regions least able to cope, principally in the tropical areas in  which DNA had not as yet produced any appreciable genetic  changes. The nations most afflicted, all Members of the United  Nations, had hitherto been protected by your votes in the Council  and the Assembly against the looting of the very substantial  natural resources from the weaker nationals.

For the first time in world history  short-range atomic missiles were fired by those who lost their  kinship for fellow-men and their fealty to world law. Many of  you in this Hall today suffered the three months of the United  Nations' dissolution. A few of you now present returned at its  re-convening, and slowly, painfully, helped restore its structure.  Let us well remember that crisis, for the basic evil which  generated it—over-population—again confronts us. Last week  the world sat stunned by the conclusive report that Mars is not  now and cannot become habitable by man. Some historians have  reminded us that the Arctic and Antarctic, now the homes of  many millions, were once thought inhabitable. An analogy to  Mars will not hold. The returned astronauts have submitted  findings which foreclose hope that human beings in any significant  number can sustain themselves on our nearest and once most  hopeful planet. Inter-planetary travel we have triumphantly  achieved. But no present or foreseeable technology can relieve  Earth of surplus people.  On this limited globe—its plains, its mountains, its glaciers  and its seas—we must contrive to keep room for our peoples,  our flocks and our crops, with the rights of individuals and  nations staunchly preserved through agreements reached in this  Hall. The twin genii of the 20th Century, the Atom and DNA,  must be harnessed to the happiness of the 21st Century.  Before calling upon the Clerk to read the Agenda, I wish  to recall the words of a forgotten statesman of the early 20th  Century. Addressing himself to a then current crisis he is said  to have reversed a dangerous situation with the words: "We  have nothing to fear but fear itself."  To you in our time of tension and tears I say: The problems  you face are no worse, nor any easier—yet are as soluble—as  those which confronted the world a century ago, when that era's  scientists first disclosed that man held in hands the control of  his children's heredity.

"The Sun Is Seeking Something Bright to Shine On"					Watson, Frank E.																											asu0660000007	"The Sun Is Seeking  Something Bright to Shine On"   WALLACE STEVENS  By Frank E. Watson, f.a.i.a.  SIXTEEN YEARS have gone by but the memory of  incidents minor is still clear. I recall the night we sat  around an oval table and traced our thoughts in the  foam—Marion Manley, Bill Green, Marjory Stoneman Douglas  and I. We talked of form and function contrasting beauty in  tradition with beauty yet to come, and in the acrid air of "The  Happy Hour" pub on Coral Way, we built on the table with  swizzle sticks, a building—an off-beat building, strong verticals  accenting low stretching horizontals.  New buildings for the University of Miami were ever present  in our minds and conversations in those days, and there amid  the clutter emerged the first thoughts ever given to a new  Library for the University.  From the beginning the Library dominated the master plan.  Together with the Memorial Plaza, Administration Building  and the Campanile, it was part of the central group of the  Campus. Of this original concept the Library and the Ashe  Memorial are the only buildings located as planned. The  Carillon was mistakenly placed in the hollow shell reclaimed,  the Campanile ended up on the cutting room floor and along  with it went the front entrance to the University.  This unhappy set of circumstances had its effect. The Library  was destined to become the new campus center and it had to  be a building worthy of this honor.  Architecture is far behind some of the other creative arts  in intuitive inspiration.  Inevitably the time lag between conception and execution  has a stultifying influence.  It is difficult to maintain the freshness of originality through  the tediousness of detail.  If you have beauty to express it is better that it be a new  beauty.  • 19 	asu06600000070021001							65174612 Bytes	3837	5660	2171724038	RGB	8	600	asu06600000070021001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/493	493	494.jp2	/asu0660/image/494.jp2
"The Sun Is Seeking Something Bright to Shine On"					Watson, Frank E.																											asu0660000007	For if it is sharp enough  There is a chance that it can better withstand the abrasive  action of comment and objection which always has some  effect, however trivial.  It is human first to reject rather than first to accept.  A new beauty, even if you are alone in seeing it and feeling  it,  Make it be new  For off-beat beauty has a way of becoming on-beat beauty  The new cadence becomes a familiar rhythm that invites  awe and participation.  But how do you design a library? You can't get it out of  books or swizzle sticks on a bar room table. Rarely does an  architect have an opportunity such as the one presented by  the University. Three libraries were designed over a span of  fourteen years—always to a gradually changing and expanding  program, but the feeling persisted for a dominant stack area  and a positive resistance to the post-war trend of low-ceilinged,  rectangular, modular, box-like warehouses for books—for after  all, books are human.  We filled-in the interims with research, but all we gathered  were opinions from reliable sources that there were 7, 8, 9V£,  10 books to a lineal foot of book shelf. So much for research.  We did add to our vocabulary and philosophy various aphorisms  invented primarily to justify our sketches; such as,  Libraries are to look out of I  Try knowledge for size!  A library should not be a mausoleum for dead authors!  Basic climate control axiom—that which is good for a book  is likewise good for a reader!  And so with a stiff spine and unshakeable resolve, we waited.  Finally, we heard from President J. F. W. Pearson that maybe  we could get started.  Dr. Archie L. McNeal, Director of Libraries for the University, had a problem—twenty-three and one-half miles of books  to be housed and not much money with which to do it;  1800 seats for readers, and a long list of other facilities that  • 20 	asu06600000070022001							64963796 Bytes	3821	5664	532717659	RGB	8	600	asu06600000070022001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/494	494	495.jp2	/asu0660/image/495.jp2

After a preliminary shuffle or two  by the staffs of the librarian and the architect, two major  requirements of the program sifted down to determine the  basic design. The undergraduate reading room with its 100,000  volumes and 800 seats that needed to be readily accessible  and available, and the more or less static storage of hundreds  of thousands of books of limited circulation.  This set the bulk of the building and logically was delineated  by our pre-destined form, a horizontal wing designed for people  and a vertical mass to house the books.  During the long period of waiting, part of the original library  site had been occupied by the Law School and the new sketches  immediately made evident the great extent of the ground floor  which literally split the campus in two. This led to developing  a plan providing a pedestrian concourse through the building  at ground level—a bold and straightforward solution to a very  difficult situation. This passage through the building invites the  student as he passes through, to stop in, use the library; makes  it possible to isolate all service facilities and the rooms used  by the public off-hours, without interfering with the smooth  functioning of the library, and as it developed, simplified the  erection, initially, of a very modest part of the ultimate building,  in order to stimulate interest in the overall project.  After fourteen years, and by this devious route, we arrived at  the beginning. We had everything going for us, a healthy atmosphere, genuine interest of the Library staff, respect for the building and for us, a feeling of personal pride in accomplishment,  anxiety over the budget, zest and enthusiasm that persisted during the planning stage and continued on into the construction,  vocal encouragement that carried us on through the Escalator  Caper, when the panic button was pushed over the great flow of  traffic at class breaks, and was solved by adding the escalator to  handle the mob; exhilaration over the exciting inner reading  court, a gem in the heart of the building for outdoor reading in  a tropical setting which had to go because of maintenance fear,  the colorful triptych in leaded glass and the subsequent bereavement over its demise . . .

But given the proper combination of chemicals, everything  comes alive  The building is ready for form and design.  We began at the top — let the sky in  With sky domes that soaked the interior in the mood of the  day.  We banished the murk of the night with light,  The glare of the day with shadows  A broad frieze of sculptured concrete providing the shade.

We hung the grand stair in the magnificent well and moved  outside to finish it off.  Proudly we placed it on a broad stylobate of the natural rock.  This softened the transition of the crisp architecture and blended  it comfortably into the normal landscape. Materials throughout  resist corrosion, are free of cliches and of compatible hue. Textures are contrasting as they come from the earth — brick and  the marble, stone and ceramic, and dominating all stands the  grand tower sheathed with tile, blue, green and gold, clean,  durable and ever-changing as it reflects the sky.

Two Reviews					Shaw, Fred; Wight, William S.																											asu0660000007	Two Reviews  The World of Dylan Thomas. By Clark Emery. University of Miami  Press. 319 pages. $6.50.  In a man less dedicated to the values of poetry, Clark Emery's taste  and wit would have been a temptation to seek an easy reputation as a  destroyer of small talents. Instead, at a time when the gulf between poet  and reader demanded not so much generous as perceptive critics, Professor Emery took the long way around, seeking a method to dress the  muse's charms and to make her more beloved.  He would devote his attention to contemporary poets — and primarily  to those whose talent commanded respect and whose obscurity demanded  explication. Like the Coleridge of the Biographia Literaria and the critical  essays, he would attempt to bring light out of darkness and to enlarge  the audience of the poet who deserved it. Again like Coleridge, he was  interested in poems of the imagination rather than the fancy — in the  imagination that "dissolves, diffuses, dissipates, in order to recreate; or  where this process is rendered impossible, yet still . . . struggles to idealize  and to unify."  Professor Emery's first book, Ideas into Action: A Study of Pound's  Cantos (1958), attracted little attention until its reception in England  assured him he would be not without honor in America. His second book,  The World of Dylan Thomas, attempts more and does it more gracefully.  And if he didn't quite wake one morning to find himself famous, he did  enter his office to the startling news that he had won the Poetry Society  of America's Melville Cane Award. He didn't even know he was competing.  As the title of his book implies, Professor Emery seeks to know Dylan  Thomas's world through his work, to illuminate his method and his  thought, and both to explicate the individual poems and to see them,  all and singly, against the whole fabric of English literature. The book  opens with a short introduction — closely written, allusive, aphoristic,  and graceful enough to make the reader hope that other scholars will go  and do likewise.  Professor Emery's individual struggle, like the poet's own, is "from  darkness towards some measure of light." He takes a look at the poet's  boyhood, pervaded by "the child's sense of aloneness in an alien world  of adults," finding the same "appraisal, if not reconciliation of opposites,"  which "characterizes Thomas's poems from the first to the last." He examines the poet's genuine resistance to compromise, his occasional Byronic  posturing, and the influences that helped to shape him. The essay is  especially valuable for the discussion of the poet's dramatic method, his  language, his images and symbols, and his place in the tradition.  Thus he compares "Fern Hill" to similar poems by Wordsworth and  Traherne, concluding that though Thomas's poem may seem "less substantial," it puts the child in nature "whereas Traherne puts him in his  idea of nature, a kind of jewel box; it is objective . . . ; and it has a delicate Tightness of touch that the heavy-handed Wordsworth . . . cannot  match."  • 24 	asu06600000070026001							64594780 Bytes	3808	5651	2723720530	RGB	8	600	asu06600000070026001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/498	498	499.jp2	/asu0660/image/499.jp2
Two Reviews					Shaw, Fred; Wight, William S.																											asu0660000007	"Twenty-Four Years" demands comparison with Milton's "How Soon  Hath Time" and with Thomas's own "Poem in October" and "Poem on  His Birthday." And Thomas's affirmations suggest comparable attitudes  of Tennyson, Browning, and Arnold, as well as the meliorism of Hardy  and the pessimism of Darwin and Zola. In "A Refusal to Mourn," on the  other hand, he contrasts tough-minded and tender-minded attitudes toward death, chides one critic and quarrels with another, and then attempts  to draw closer to the poet's meaning.  The point is that each poem requires a different approach, and Professor Emery tries to take to it whatever can illumine from biography or  criticism or literature or the intellectual spirit of the time that the poet  was born to. Some of the analyses become a dialogue between the author  and Thomas's other interpreters — Brinnin, Olson, Tindall, and the rest;  and though the reader may sometimes wish the critics would let sleeping  ambiguities lie, it's an excellent method that supplies its own corrective.  The World of Dylan Thomas is a rich and rewarding book; and few  who read it would deny "the boily boy" a place "in the Establishment—  not among the Giants and Titans, but somewhere not too remote from  the Mar veils and Landors who without ever achieving the big thing are  still indispensable to the anthologists." Fred Shaw  A Collector of Characters; Reminiscenses of Theodore Spicer-Simson.  University of Miami Press, 1962. Plates, 197 pp., $12.50.  These reminiscences spotlight the names of many people and places  pertinent to the cultural interests of his lifetime (1871-1959) and relate  many anecdotes about them. Coming at unexpected intervals, these names  and anecdotes filled me with serendipity and deep nostalgic pleasure. To  anyone who enjoys such vicarious pleasure, I recommend this book. The  reader should be warned, however, that the chronology is difficult to  follow and that the author frequently fails to give sufficient information  when it is needed. Spicer-Simson dictated these reminiscences to his wife  in his declining years; his mind, always active and inquisitive, jumped  from one remembered face, place, and incident to another.  The names and anecdotes gave the author pleasure also. Throughout  his life he enjoyed almost everything: the circumstances of his birth that  helped make him a cosmopolitan, his education, his apprenticeship, his  art, and his subjects — especially the men and women who sat for his  portrait medallions and became his friends. Perhaps the best way to show  his pleasure and mine is not to list the names and anecdotes but to tie  them to a biographical thread.  Born in Le Havre, France, of English parents, Spicer-Simson was educated in England and Germany, and consequently spoke French, English,  and German fluently. He was especially delighted when his father offered  to send him to Paris, pay for his room, and give him a hundred francs  a month for necessities. There he learned to model flowers in clay, prepared himself for and subsequently entered the Ecole des Beaux Arts,  and later studied in the school of Colarossi. At twenty-four he felt fortunate to be "somewhat appreciated."

There  he mingled enjoyably with the artist colonies of Montparnasse.  Spicer-Simson had good help in "collecting" his characters — those  whom he had already collected. For instance, Stephen Mackenna, the  Irish journalist, became his friend; through Mackenna he met James  Stephens, author of The Crock of Gold; George Russell (A.E.); Dudley  Digges, the Irish actor; Henri Dumay, director of a French newspaper;  and Vance Thompson, the American Journalist.  The author never ceased to visit England, where sitters followed one  another: W. H. Hudson, Arnold Bennett, Walter de la Mare, W. B.  Yeats, and others.

Sherman wrote a critical monograph for each author portrayed.  In the United States again he busily modeled Sherwood Anderson,  Theodore Dreiser, Henry L. Mencken, Edward Arlington Robinson, and  others. Soon he had sufficient material for a proposed book which he  tentatively thought of calling "eminent American literateurs." Hervey  Allen had promised to write the monographs, but unfortunately died  (1950) before he could do so. Back in France Spicer-Simson sketched  various members of the Academie des Goncourt and planned a book on  "French writers of distinction." This also was never published.  The World War II years were spent at Les Volets Verts (The Green  Shutters), an old farmhouse which the Spicer-Simsons had bought in  Bourron, a village near Fontainebleau, and a prison camp at Besan?on,  where he was incarcerated during the German occupation because he had  always retained his English citizenship. "Suddenly it was D day." It took  Margy nine months to regain her American passport, which had been  revoked because she had refused to leave her husband in France. Late  in 1946 they returned to Coconut Grove, where they had bought a house  near the property of their old friends, David Fairchild and Alexander  Graham Bell. Never ceasing to "collect," he "rounded off" his "life's  work" by making a portrait of Robert Frost.  In two of the closing chapters Spicer-Simson summarized his ideas  on art and technique: "The Art of the Medallion" and "The Art of the  Medal." He carefully distinguished medallic portraits, which he modeled  in exact size with his fingers and a small wooden instrument, from medals,  which were modeled in larger size, subjected to "reducing machines," and  struck or impressed by dies. In his portraits he "attempted to interpret  the psychology of the individual sitter before laying down a single feature.  The position of the head in the circle, the character and arrangement of  the lettering, or the high or low relief" were the qualities that he sought.  Gamaliel Bradford indicated his success by writing him thus: "I think that  you have developed in your work a remarkable gift of sensing and  fastening in memory the distinguishing traits and interests of your sitters."  The handsome book contains forty-four pages of photographic reproductions of Spicer-Simson's works of art: medals, decorative panels, busts,  fountains, and portrait medallions. In addition it has a foreword by  Padraic Colum, a list of the many American and European museums that  have acquired his sculptures, and a list of his honors.  Happy nostalgia! William S.

Petrarch's Other Love					Lawrence, Natalie Grimes																											asu0660000008	THE  CARRELL  Volume 4 December, 1963 Number 2  PETRARCH'S OTHER LOVE  By Natalie Grimes Lawrence  WHEN HE WENT TO VAUCLUSE in 1337, partly  to try to escape his desperate love for Madonna  Laura and partly to avoid the corruption of the  Court of Avigon, Petrarch took his books with him. There in his  simple cottage by the River Sorgue, he wrote to Giovanni dell'  Incisa, in 1346: "I am still in the thrall of one insatiable desire,  which hitherto I have been neither willing or able to check . . .  I cannot get enough books . . . What is more not only does a  book win the reader's affection for itself, but it mentions the  names of other books, so that one stirs the desire for another."  Petrarch bids his friend to seek trustworthy and competent  men to go through the book-chests of Tuscany searching for  books to "alleviate or increase his thirst." He encloses a list  and adds that he is sending like requests to friends in Britain,  France and Spain. In the De Remediis Utriusque Fortunae  he analyzed the value of books as follows:  If you would win glory from your books you  must know them and not merely have them;  must stow them away, not in your library, but in  your memory, not in your book-cases but in your  brain.  And yet he did store them away in his library as well as in  •  1 	asu06600000080003001							65968092 Bytes	3910	5622	40896097	RGB	8	600	asu06600000080003001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/543	543	544.jp2	/asu0660/image/544.jp2
Petrarch's Other Love					Lawrence, Natalie Grimes																											asu0660000008	his mind. Twice he had the delight of finding lost manuscripts  of Cicero. As a young man, in 1333, he traveled to Paris,  the northern provinces, and Belgium. On this excursion he  was probably introduced to the library of the Sorbonne by  the chancellor of Notre Dame, Roberti de Bardi. When Petrarch  continued his journey, he was constantly on the alert for  monasteries, where precious books might be stored, yet unregarded. At Liege, he found two discourses of Cicero's, one  of which Petrarch copied—the Pro Archia—while a friend  transcribed the other.  Some twelve years later, Petrarch discovered, in the  Cathedral Library at Verona, the manuscript containing the  sixteen books of Cicero's letters Ad Atticurn, three books of  Ad Quintum and two of Ad Brutum. Not able to hire an  amanuensis of sufficient skill, Petrarch himself copied the entire  manuscript, although he was ill at the time. As his own letters  advise us, he was constantly buying books, and he attracted  them from others. He studied and annotated the books in his  considerable library. With the classics within easy reach, he  wrote his own books and letters. Commenting upon Cicero's  Orator in the foreword to the De Vita Solitaria, Petrarch exclaims: "... good God, what a work it is and how loftily  inspired!" Besides his own numerous Latin books, Petrarch  made a metrical version of the Penitential Psalms and translated  Boccaccio's story of Griselda, altering it somewhat, into Latin,  Petrarch arranged for a Latin translation of his Greek copy  of Homer's Iliad. In the spring of 1363, Leontius Pilatus and  Boccaccio worked upon his translation at Petrarch's house in  Venice, a dwelling overlooking the harbor and assigned to  him by the Republic.  When Petrarch first began to gather a library together, he  purchased a goodly number of the classical historians, a few  other prose writers, and many Latin poets, a fine manuscript  of Horace with commentary and Propertius among them. In  the last twenty-one years of his life, spent mostly in Italy,  when the duties of his various canonries became more pressing,  he also bought and read the churchly fathers. However, he  did not cease to admire the great Romans for their style,  though preferring the patristic writers for the life they counseled.

Petrarch's Other Love					Lawrence, Natalie Grimes																											asu0660000008	Cicero and Virgil were his models; as for Saint Jerome,  Petrarch remarked that if the holy father thought that he had  a style he greatly deceived himself. He recalls in one of the  Familiar Letters (XXI, 10) that from the time he was a  boy in the grammar school at Carpentras, Cicero had been  dear to him, for when he was read aloud to the boys although  Petrarch at that time could gain no meaning from the words,  yet they had a certain sweetness and sonority to the ear that  made all else seem rude and discordant.  It was in the lonely peace of his Transalpine retreat, Vaucluse,  that Petrarch summed up the power of literature over him.  "And indeed isolation without literature is exile, prison, torture;  supply literature, and it becomes your country, freedom, and  delight." Such a point of view combined with his need for a  place of his own in which to live and carry on his studies  seems to have caused Petrarch in 1362 to take steps to propose  to the Venetian State that if St. Mark's would lodge him, he  would at his death leave the library, which he had transported  with him from Padua, to Venice.  Because of the political insecurity of northern Italy, he had  felt forced to flee from Padua and now uncertain whether  revenues from his canonry could reach him, he turned to his  friend, Benintendi, the chancellor of the Republic, and he it was  who carried Petrarch's offer of the legacy of his books to the  Grand Council. They approved the plan and gave the laureate  the Palazzo delle due torri as a residence to fulfill their part  of the exchange. Formal papers were drawn and duly attested,  thus binding both parties to the agreement. Nolhac (See  Petrarque et Vhumanisme) took the pains to study this document  among the state papers of Venice and came to the conclusion  that Petrarch had envisioned nothing less than the foundation  of a great public library of which the Venetian State would  take charge after the donor's death and which could render  to posterity such services as had been supplied by the impressive collections of antiquity, of which he had read in history.  Nolhac further believes that Petrarch did not mention this  legacy of his books in his later will because he was aware of  the binding nature of the document just discussed.  However, weary of the Averroists, he departed for Padua 	asu06600000080005001							66978732 Bytes	3908	5711	248425615	RGB	8	600	asu06600000080005001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/545	545	546.jp2	/asu0660/image/546.jp2

Petrarch's Other Love					Lawrence, Natalie Grimes																											asu0660000008	in 1367, taking his books with him as he was entitled to do  in accordance with the agreement with the Venetian State,  for he was to have use of them during his lifetime. But alas! for  men's dreams and the papers they commit them to. When  Petrarch rested his head upon the manuscript over which he  had been laboring in his customary vigil the night of July 18,  1374, and breathed his last, Padua and Venice were at strife,  and the books never were sent to Venice.  They were in Padua five years after Petrarch's death when  Colluccio Salutati was in correspondence about them, attempting to obtain copies. Thereafter they seem to have been  scattered, some going to Rome, some to Mantua, and some to  Verona. A large part appear to have been retained by the  poet's patron, the Lord of Padua, Francesco Carrara, and to  have been surrendered to the Visconti and carried off to Pavia  when Padua fell in 1388. Those that ultimately reached Paris  were identified in the late nineteenth century by Nolhac through  a minute and trained scrutiny of the marginal annotations in  Petrarch's hand. He found thirty-eight to be extant, most of  them in the Bibliotheque Nationale, the others at Rome, Venice,  and Florence, a partial representation only of Petrarch's fifty  years of eager and persistent collecting.  The works of Petrarch abundantly testify to his love of  books; the codices of his library show him to have been a  bibliophile, savoring the very look and feel of books. They  make it easy to accept the story that he always apologized for  a parchment if it were not fresh and clean. All his books  were on parchment with the exception of a few prepared  for him which were on fine vellum chosen to please his  connoisseur's eye. In 1426, fifty-two years after his death, an  inventory was made for the dukes of Milan. When Nolhac  came across it in the Bibliotheque Nationale, he commented  that it was like a fragment of a catalogue of Petrarch's books;  further their binding indicated that they truly were those which  had been in his library such as the Cassiodorus, variarum cum  Petro Abaelardo, covered in antique green leather; the Iliad,  in red leather and decorated with nails. There were the  Fulgencius cum Ausonio Cassiodoro, Sibella, Prudentio . . .  listed as greatly beautiful, covered in new red leather, with  • 5 	asu06600000080007001							66419036 Bytes	3891	5688	3072783055	RGB	8	600	asu06600000080007001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/547	547	548.jp2	/asu0660/image/548.jp2

And shining forth  in white leather, with a brass key was the Liber Eustachii  metropolotani super ethicis Aristotelis.  No wonder that such books, beautiful without and beautiful  within helped to call into being that many-sided period, the  Renaissance. To Petrarch these and others were his intimates,  with not only commentary committed to them but notations  of a more personal bearing. For instance, he started a little  journal of gardening on the fly-leaves of the volume containing  the Agriculture of Palladius. And in the copy of the Virgil  now in the Ambrosian Museum at Milan, the poet of the  canzoniere recorded in 1348 the death of Laura whose "light  was taken from this light."  Though books may not be the key that unlocks the sonnets,  the collecting of codex after codex of those authors that Petrarch  read and loved seems to have provided a core about which  his life was built. His learning was contagious; kings, popes and  nobles, poets, and scholars sought his friendship and companionship. The many volumes of the Latin letters that he wrote  his friends reveal his own warmth of friendship. But always  from the days at Vaucluse through the last four years at Arqua  in the Euganean hills, he studied and wrote nightly. Rising at  midnight, he could meet the dawn with much work already  accomplished.  Petrarch loved books and the world has benefited. 	asu06600000080008001							65148232 Bytes	3824	5677	928134176	RGB	8	600	asu06600000080008001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/548	548	549.jp2	/asu0660/image/549.jp2
A Defense of Difficulties in William Faulkner's Art					Thompson, Lawrance																											asu0660000008	A DEFENSE OF DIFFICULTIES  IN WILLIAM FAULKNER'S ART  By Lawrance Thompson  NEWS ITEMS and obituaries published immediately  after Faulkner's death in Oxford, Mississippi, on  6 July 1962, quite naturally referred to the long  and intense controversy which had been caused by difficulties  in the style and subject-matter of his writings. These references  correctly implied that the general American reading-public  possessed only a cursory and superficial familiarity with his  works; that Faulkner's peculiar forms of story telling were too  obscure and confusing for the common reader.  Those claims may be true. But the following defense assumes  that the Friends of the University of Miami Library should be  uncommonly good readers, and that they should therefore  increase their familiarity with Faulkner's best works. Why?  Because the expense of energy which Faulkner does require of  a proper reader is always amply rewarded by Faulkner: his  difficult narrative techniques, when properly contemplated,  should heighten our understanding of his attitudes toward the  difficult problems raised by the stories themselves. The defense  which I propose to make here is elementary in its process. I am  going to tell just enough about relationships between methods and  meanings, in two of Faulkner's novels, to illustrate the "pay-off"  quality of those relationships.  Let me begin by describing one technical gambit worth  noticing in one of Faulkner's best novels. The narrative is  constructed around three tableau-scenes, each of which represents two people sitting-and-talking. In the first, a white-haired  lady is sitting in her own parlor in Jefferson, Mississippi, talking  to a young man of college age who is about to go north to enter  Harvard College as a freshman. The time is the autumn of  1909, and the white-haired lady is asking the young man to  do her a favor that evening. She wants him to borrow his father's  horse and carriage so that he can drive her out to an old ramshackle mansion on an abandoned plantation which is near the  edge of Jefferson. She has a hunch that a nephew of hers is  hiding there as a fugitive from justice. To explain, Miss Rosa  • 7 	asu06600000080009001							65668456 Bytes	3832	5709	359599602	RGB	8	600	asu06600000080009001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/549	549	550.jp2	/asu0660/image/550.jp2
A Defense of Difficulties in William Faulkner's Art					Thompson, Lawrance																											asu0660000008	Coldfield tells the listening Quentin Compson a story which  is so fantastic that he has great difficulty in understanding it.  Because Quentin serves Faulkner as the center of consciousness  through whose perceptions we as readers get the facts, we as  readers have to share with him the difficulties of trying to understand Miss Rosa's version of that fantastic story.  It has to do with a man named Thomas Sutpen, who has been  dead for some forty years, but who was well known to Miss  Rosa because Sutpen had married Miss Rosa's own sister, back  in the old time before the War Between the States. When Sutpen  had first come into Jefferson, riding on horseback, he had been  a complete stranger. But he had had plans, elaborate plans, and  he had decided to settle in Jefferson. He wanted to buy a hundred  square miles of bottomland jungle. He wanted to hack a  plantation out of that jungle. He wanted to build a big mansion  in the middle of it. He wanted to find a wife, and to raise a  family, and to establish himself as an honorable and dignified  citizen of Jefferson. More than all that, he wanted to have  children who would establish a noble line of Sutpen descent.  According to Miss Rosa's version of the story, Thomas Sutpen  had heroically carried out almost all the parts of his plan. He  had bought the land, built the great mansion, married the sister  of Miss Rosa, begotten children, and raised Henry and Judith  Sutpen to maturity. When the son Henry was old enough to be  sent to college, he had gone to the University of Mississippi.  But precisely there in the story, according to Miss Rosa, a crisis  had arisen. Henry had precipitated the crisis by bringing home  from the university, during one Christmas vacation, a handsome  young man who had become his closest friend. During that short  vacation, the handsome Charles Bon had romantically fallen  in love with Henry's only sister Judith — much to Henry's  delight, because he wanted a brother and he wanted Charles  Bon to become a member of the Sutpen family.  But, according to Miss Rosa, Henry's father had opposed  that courtship—inexplicably, inexcusably. Worse than that, he  had made it clear to Henry that Charles Bon should never  again be brought into the Sutpen mansion. Reasons? Not given.  Hurt, indignant, infuriated, Henry had sided so much with  Charles Bon that he had turned against his father and had vowed  8  • 	asu06600000080010001							63389224 Bytes	3751	5631	4202586207	RGB	8	600	asu06600000080010001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/550	550	551.jp2	/asu0660/image/551.jp2

The friendship between those two  young men had increased so steadily that when the War came  they had enlisted together in the Confederate Army and had  served as comrades in arms throughout four bloody years.  Then, according to Miss Rosa, another crisis had arisen;  another inexplicable crisis. Returning from the War, the two  young men had seemed to be violating the command of Thomas  Sutpen and the vow of Henry Sutpen: together they had ridden  back toward Sutpen Hundred in Jefferson, and had gotten as  far as the plantation gate. But there, Miss Rosa said, Henry  had inexplicably shot and killed his closest friend, his comrade-  in-arms, and then had ridden off and disappeared as a fugitive  from justice. Now, more than fifty years after that murder, and  more than forty years after the death of Thomas Sutpen, Miss  Rosa has her own reasons for believing that her nephew Henry  Sutpen had returned again to the old Sutpen mansion and was  hiding there.  End of the first part of the story. The second part begins with  another tableau, in which two people are once again merely  sitting and talking. Rather, once again, one of the characters is  doing all the talking and the other is doing all the listening.  Once again, the listener is Quentin Compson, this time sitting  on the gallery of his own home, during the evening of the same  day, listening to his father's remarks concerning Miss Rosa's  version of the Sutpen story. Her request will be granted, and the  young man can borrow the Compson horse and carriage for that  ride in the dark with Miss Rosa to the Sutpen mansion. But while  father and son wait for twilight to fall, Mr. Compson tells Quentin another version of the Sutpen story. It is a version which adds  new details and thus improves the understanding of Quentin and  the reader; but that new version is just as fantastic, just as  incredible, just as meaningless, as was Miss Rosa's version,  particularly concerning the two crucial elements in the story.  End of the second part, and the third part would seem to be  foreshadowed. The puzzled reader anticipates that the third  part will tell of the ride out to the old Sutpen mansion which  will clear up all the mysteries. But the reader is not given the  expected. Instead, Part Three begins once again with another  •  9  V 	asu06600000080011001							65117908 Bytes	3852	5633	3001113410	RGB	8	600	asu06600000080011001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/551	551	552.jp2	/asu0660/image/552.jp2

This time, the talker  is Quentin Compson, and the place is his Harvard College  dormitory room, and the listener is a young Canadian roommate  named Shrevlin McCannon. On the table between them is a  letter from Quentin's father announcing the death of Miss Rosa  Coldfield back home in Jefferson, Mississippi. The Canadian  has trouble in understanding why Quentin should be so upset  by the death of an elderly lady who was not even related to  Quentin. In his effort to explain, Quentin has to do more than  describe that carriage-ride in the dark with Miss Rosa to find  Henry Sutpen hiding there, just as she had expected. Quentin  has to tell his roommate his own version of the whole Sutpen  story. But now it is the Canadian who becomes increasingly  puzzled, because even Quentin's version fails to clarify the two  crucial and enigmatic factors in the story. Shrevlin keeps interrupting Quentin to say, "Wait a minute, for God's sake wait."  Quentin has to admit that there are indeed many parts of the  story which he can not explain. But at this point Faulkner as  narrator represents the two young men as at least trying to  imagine, trying to guess, trying to create possible motives and  facts which might make that Sutpen story intelligible. As narrator, Faulkner comments twice on this collaborative act of these  two characters. At first he says in effect, and with apparent  deprecation, that perhaps there may be no value in having these  two characters in a fiction create further fictions about Sutpen.  But later, after the reader has become convinced that the two  young men are at least helping the reader understand valid  possibilities, Faulkner comments again: he praises them for  what they are represented as trying to do.  Perhaps it is not until this point in the story that the reader  begins to appreciate some important relations, here, between  how Faulkner is telling the story and what his story-telling-  method is making the story mean. The collaborative acts of  Quentin-as-teller and of Shreve-as-listener may be seen as implicitly analogous to the ideally collaborative acts of Faulkner-  as-narrator and the reader as one kind of listener. Quentin is  trying to understand a past which involves people who were  dead before he was born; trying to understand relationships  between those dead people and his own living relatives; trying  10 • 	asu06600000080012001							63963992 Bytes	3777	5643	1835058425	RGB	8	600	asu06600000080012001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/552	552	553.jp2	/asu0660/image/553.jp2
A Defense of Difficulties in William Faulkner's Art					Thompson, Lawrance																											asu0660000008	to explain his own interpretation of that story to an outsider, a  Canadian. At the same time, the outsider is imaginatively and  thus collaboratively trying to help Quentin as narrator. By  analogy, Faulkner as narrator is trying to understand, interpret,  explain, by means of a fiction, part of his own true history, his  own dead past. It is just as much the function of a fiction-writer  as it is the function of an historian to see the past in terms of  continuities, in terms of cause-and-effect, which may establish  possible or actual relationships between the past, the present,  and the possible future. The serious fiction-writer knows—just  as well as the historian knows—that the past has no reality for  us until we recreate it by imagining possible motives for past  actions, so that we may realize that past in ways which make it  useful to us in the present, and further useful as foreshadowing  future possibilities.  Faulkner never says that. Instead, he arranges the telling of  this narrative in such a way that the reader has to work alongside  Quentin Compson; has to go back and back over the same story  in trying to overcome difficulties, in trying to understand what  may have happened to motivate Sutpen the father and Sutpen  the son.  It was not necessary for Faulkner to introduce three versions  of the same story, if he had merely wanted to tell the story of  what happened to the Sutpens. But by employing those three  tableaux, he has done something more than create difficulties  for Quentin and Shreve and the reader. He has arranged to  make Quentin Compson become the central character, in this  story; the center of consciousness and of conscience. The heart  of the story is not Sutpen. The heart of the story is what Quentin  and his roommate collaboratively make out of an otherwise  meaningless and incomplete set of facts-and-fictions. All the  difficulties thus placed before Quentin and Shreve and the reader  are difficulties which force the reader to dramatize or to act out  in his own consciousness important parts of Faulkner's central  thematic concerns. What are they? To answer that question, we  need to return to see what those two young men did guess,  imagine, create, for purposes of making the story make sense.  We need to see how Quentin used some of the new information  he picked up, during that evening ride to the Sutpen mansion  •  11 	asu06600000080013001							65041084 Bytes	3821	5672	1582694630	RGB	8	600	asu06600000080013001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/553	553	554.jp2	/asu0660/image/554.jp2
A Defense of Difficulties in William Faulkner's Art					Thompson, Lawrance																											asu0660000008	with Miss Rosa.  In retrospect, Quentin feels sure that his quest has provided  him with one new fact which indicates a basic motivation for the  entire Sutpen story. It is an anecdote of an event which occurred  during the boyhood of Thomas Sutpen; an anecdote which  neither Miss Rosa nor Mr. Compson had initially told Quentin.  Thomas Sutpen had been born into a "poor white" family in  Virginia. His enterprising father had worked his way up through  ignominious serfdom until he had become a manager of slaves  on a Virginia plantation. One day, after the boy Thomas Sutpen  was old enough to work with his father, young Sutpen had been  sent by his father to the plantation mansion with a written  message about business matters, and had been told to deliver it  to the owner of the plantation. Not knowing any better, and not  realizing his position in the social scale, the boy had gone to the  front door of the big house and had knocked. But a Negro butler  who understood much about the social scale had opened the  door just wide enough to tell the boy, insolently, that the likes  of him should always go around to the back and knock at the  servant-entrance, with or without a message. Then the butler  had firmly closed the door.  Hurt by the indignity of that rebuke, Sutpen had then and  there begun to make plans. They were not plans of revenge.  Idealistically he began to dream that some day he himself would  earn money enough to build his own plantation house, on the  same grand scale; that when he had a family of his own, he  would raise his children and his slaves to understand consider-  ateness and courtesy for all human beings. And if ever anyone  should knock at Thomas Sutpen's front door, that person would  be treated with dignity, so that even the lowliest would never  suffer the shame of having Sutpen's door slammed in his face.  Thus motivated, Sutpen started out to realize that dream,  that plan, that design for his own future. When he grew old  enough, he did set out to make his fortune. He went to the  West Indies to work, and he gradually improved his position  until he became the foreman of Negro slaves on a sugar plantation. For years he saved his earnings, which were greatly  increased by a generous award paid him when he saved the  owner of the plantation from a riot of slaves; saved the owner's  12  • 	asu06600000080014001							65132384 Bytes	3823	5677	1212309427	RGB	8	600	asu06600000080014001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/554	554	555.jp2	/asu0660/image/555.jp2

For  those heroic actions, Sutpen was rewarded not only with money  but also with the hand of the daughter, in marriage. This all  seemed part of his romantic dream until his first child was born.  Then and only then did Sutpen learn that his wife had inherited,  with all her money, a slight taint of Negro blood. Of course it  was not her fault, and she had previously known nothing about  it. But Sutpen felt that her father had been guilty of a criminal  deception. Nevertheless, instead of expressing anger, Sutpen  courteously explained to the girl's father his plan, dream, design,  which included the establishment of a noble line of descent, and  then explained that this taint of Negro blood would not fit that  plan. So he obtained a divorce, made a money settlement for  their child, and moved on. Troubled by the awkwardness of that  situation, he was at least content that he had been just, courteous,  and logical in his resolution of it. But his divorced wife had not  been content, and she had apparently developed her own plan,  dream, design, which was to avenge herself against the man who  had left her with a fatherless son. So she had moved to New  Orleans with her son, had kept track of Sutpen, had learned of  his second marriage, had known how Henry and Judith were  brought up. When Sutpen had sent his second to the University  of Mississippi, his first wife had deliberately and vengefully sent  his first son there with full information concerning family  relationships.  So Quentin guessed or imagined. But Quentin further guessed  that it was not by accident the two boys had met; that through  no coincidence, the first son had arranged to have himself invited  to the home of the man who no longer acknowledged fatherhood  of that son. Quentin also guessed that what the first son Charles  Bon wanted most was not revenge, not even the chance to  court his half-sister Judith, but primarily the chance to let  Thomas Sutpen admit, even if secretly, that Charles Bon was  his son.  But Quentin and his roommate Shreve collaborate in imagining, still further, that when Thomas Sutpen had told his second  son Henry, during that Christmas vacation, that his friend  Charles Bon must never again be brought home, Sutpen had  given him no honest reasons for that decision; that only after  •  13 	asu06600000080015001							65541816 Bytes	3843	5683	269568932	RGB	8	600	asu06600000080015001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/555	555	556.jp2	/asu0660/image/556.jp2
A Defense of Difficulties in William Faulkner's Art					Thompson, Lawrance																											asu0660000008	Henry had indignantly turned against his father had Charles  told Henry they were half-brothers; that Charles Bon, showing  no traces of the "taint" of Negro blood, had had his own social  reasons for not wanting Henry to know that.  Guessing still further, Quentin and Shreve imagine that it  might have been only after the War Between the States, and  while still encamped as defeated soldiers, that Thomas Sutpen  as officer had sent for only one of his sons, Henry, to insist that  Charles Bon must not return, ever, to Sutpen Hundred to go  on with his courtship of Judith; must never return, not because  he was her half-brother, but because he was part Negro. Still  guessing, Quentin and Shreve imagine that Henry had loved  Charles Bon so much as friend and brother that what their  father might have told him could not have ended their friendship. It could only have brought an end to any further talk of  Charles Bon's continuing his courtship of Henry's sister. But  if Charles Bon had then given up his hopeless quest for being  acknowledged as the son of Thomas Sutpen, he might have  decided to avenge himself on Sutpen by insisting that he would  go back to Sutpen Hundred, unless Henry stopped him.  Quentin and Shreve imagine that as Henry and Charles Bon  had ridden toward the gate of Sutpen Hundred, Charles had said,  "So it's the miscegenation, not the incest, which you can't  bear."  They imagine that Henry might have said,  "Think of her. Not of me: of her."  They imagine that Charles Bon might have answered,  "I have. For four years. Of you and her. Now I am thinking  of myself."  The reader here goes deep into Faulknerian meanings by  way of these collaborative imaginings: it would seem that both  of Sutpen's sons were chips off the same old block, because  "self" had always been the heart (or at least the mind) of  Sutpen's dream, plan, design. Not love, but self-love had established the matrix for Sutpen's tragedy, and for the tragedy which  eventually lost him both sons, in that moment when one son  lay dead and the other became a fugitive from justice. Quentin,  who had at first tried to view the entire account as a romantic  love-story, a variant on the old theme of Romeo and Juliet, is  14 • 	asu06600000080016001							65070552 Bytes	3832	5657	3064767361	RGB	8	600	asu06600000080016001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/556	556	557.jp2	/asu0660/image/557.jp2
A Defense of Difficulties in William Faulkner's Art					Thompson, Lawrance																											asu0660000008	now represented as repeating to himself, with shocked surprise,  "But that's not love. That's still not love."  Indeed this is a story in which love gets defined in terms of  its opposites. It is a self-love story, a self-hate story, and all the  virtues which went to make Thomas Sutpen the gigantically  heroic figure he was—the strength of will and muscle and  motive—had lacked only one virtue: the capacity for self-giving,  self-sacrificing, self-surrendering love. So the two sons had inherited from the father the same tragic flaw, together with all  the social prejudices and the capacity to transform any kind of  love into self-hate.  The title of this novel is borrowed by Faulkner from The  Bible; it is Absalom, Absalom! The reader is expected to  remember the famous Biblical lament of a father named David  for a son named Absalom, the lament uttered when David heard  that the prophecy of Nathan had been fulfilled. Many analogies  are implied by Faulkner, between the life of David and the life  of Thomas Sutpen, and are permitted to accumulate. Remember  for example the reproach of the prophet Nathan to David:  "Thus saith the Lord: Behold I will raise up evil against thee  out of thine own house . . . and the son that is born unto thee  shall surely die."  So it turned out, in both stories. But when David received the  news of the death of Absalom, he took on himself or at least  shared part of the responsibility for the estrangements between  father and son; the estrangements which caused the ultimate  deaths of two of David's sons:  "O my son Absalom, my son, my son. Would God I had died  for thee."  Thomas Sutpen never made any such lament. The distance  between what he did say and what David said is one measure  of what was lacking in the heroic, the powerful, the potentially  great Thomas Sutpen.  That summary of the story leaves much untold, and is  calculated to stimulate a full reading or re-reading of one of  Faulkner's best: Absalom, Absalom! It is also calculated to  demonstrate that the peculiar and difficult artistic logic back of  the strangely Faulknerian way of unravelling that story is justifiable because it is the factor which makes available precisely the  •  15 	asu06600000080017001							65434084 Bytes	3836	5684	1978262155	RGB	8	600	asu06600000080017001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/557	557	558.jp2	/asu0660/image/558.jp2
A Defense of Difficulties in William Faulkner's Art					Thompson, Lawrance																											asu0660000008	kinds of meaning which we have at least partially considered.  Now glance more briefly at another difficult story-telling  procedure used by Faulkner in another of his best works. Start  this time with the title itself, even though it may at first seem  quite meaningless: Go Down, Moses. That volume may be taken  as a volume of short stories or as an experimental novel: each  of the seven stories is part of the saga of one and the same  family, the McCaslin family, living on another plantation outside  Jefferson, Mississippi. Once again, Faulkner had his reasons  for not unfolding the saga in a chronological cause-and-effect  sequence. The scrambling of the chronology is effected by  placing these stories in what seems at first to be an outrageously  higgledy-piggledy pattern. Even within several of the stories  there is a further disarray of time sequences which seems at  first to be merely confusing. Worse than that, there are so many  different characters introduced, from three branches of the  McCaslin family tree, and even from three generations of descent  from one man, in each branch, that the reader once again has to  do some hard work in figuring out blood-relationships. But again  the effort helps to dramatize meanings, and is amply rewarded.  All the related episodes in Go Down, Moses are presented as  rememberings, and old-age rememberings, of a second-generation McCaslin named Isaac. He is the center of consciousness  and gradually he emerges as the center of conscience for the  entire family. He sees all the mistakes made by other members,  but he is not too quick to judge them retrospectively because he  himself is painfully aware of his having made one crucial mistake  of his own from his twenty-first birthday. That mistake haunts  and troubles him from the beginning to the end of his rememberings. I shall return to it after I have explained how Faulkner  once again involves us very sympathetically by forcing us to  puzzle over and worry over one particular difficulty: McCaslin  family relationships.  All three branches of the family stem from a hardy Scotsman  named Carothers McCaslin, who, early in the nineteenth century,  had come as a pioneer to Mississippi from Carolina with his  wife, daughter, twin sons, and a few slaves. He had purchased  from the Indians the land he developed into a plantation. He  had lived to work the land profitably, and to see descendents  16 • 	asu06600000080018001							64589396 Bytes	3816	5640	1405014459	RGB	8	600	asu06600000080018001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/558	558	559.jp2	/asu0660/image/559.jp2
A Defense of Difficulties in William Faulkner's Art					Thompson, Lawrance																											asu0660000008	prosper in at least two of the three branches. In the male line  of descent, one of his twin sons had married and had begotten  Isaac, who had no offspring. On the distaff side, the daughter of  Carothers McCaslin had married an Edmonds, and had named  her son McCaslin Edmonds in tribute to her father. That son,  when he grew up, married and had a son whom he named  Carothers Edmonds in further tribute to "the old Abraham" of  the clan.  Thus considered, those two branches of descent scarcely seem  to leave room for a third. But after the wife of old Carothers  McCaslin died, he became lonely enough to take into his bed  a pretty slave girl who bore him a daughter and who thus  established the third branch, the part-Negro branch, of the  genealogical tree. Of course old Carothers McCaslin never  formally acknowledged that part-Negro daughter as a blood-  relative, and she was never allowed to use the McCaslin name.  But when she grew old enough to become sexually attractive,  old Carothers McCaslin did pay some attention to her. He did  care enough about her (and so little about either incest or  miscegenation) that he also took that pretty girl into his bed  and thus begot a son who was also his grandson. Again he did  not acknowledge that blood-relative, except that in his will he  made legal arrangements by which a certain amount of disinheritance money was allocated to be paid for a time to each child  in that Negro line of descent, on the occasion when each child  came of age.  Various love-and-hate conflicts between blood-relatives in  all three branches of the McCaslin clan, as it flourished, provide  the subject matter for the separate chapters of the saga. But  finally, as it was in the beginning, so in the end: a great-grandson  of Carothers McCaslin named Carothers Edmonds falls in love  with and takes into his bed an apparently white girl who just  happens to be a great-granddaughter of Carothers McCaslin in  the part-Negro line of descent, and when that incestuous miscegenation is blessed by the birth of a son, the old ritual is repeated.  The young man leaves with his great uncle, Isaac McCaslin, a  sum of disinheritance money to be paid to the girl. She appears,  and astonishes Isaac not only by calling him "Uncle Isaac" but  also by holding him at least partly responsible for her predica-  •  17 	asu06600000080019001							65092992 Bytes	3841	5647	136650474	RGB	8	600	asu06600000080019001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/559	559	560.jp2	/asu0660/image/560.jp2

In answer to his protest, she reminds him of the crucial  mistake Isaac made on the day he came of age; the mistake to  which we may now return.  As Isaac McCaslin had grown towards manhood he had come  to understand blood-relationships in his family well enough to  be ashamed of them, and on his twenty-first birthday he had  tried to disassociate himself from the evils and inhumanities  which had darkened the history of his family. He was the legal  inheritor of the McCaslin plantation, but he refused to accept  it; he "sold his birthright" to his older cousin McCaslin Edmonds  for what he later viewed as "a mess of pottage." His motives had  been honorable and idealistic. But even at the time of his  renunciation, Isaac had been warned by his older cousin that  the inheritance of evil, both inner and outer evil, is an inescapable part of any human being's birth-right; that the inheritance  of guilt and of moral responsibility for the mistakes of one's  ancestors can not be repudiated successfully by anyone. During  that argument, Isaac had not understood the point his cousin  had tried to make. Later, after he had fully surrendered his  ownership of the family property, he had come to understand  the mistake he had made, and he spent the rest of his life trying  to compensate for it, particularly in his dealings with the  part-Negro branch of the McCaslin family.  Quite clearly, the title for this volume is borrowed by Faulkner from the chorus of a familiar Negro spiritual:  Go down, Moses, way down in Egypt's land,  Tell old Pharoah to let my people go.  Echoes from that old song recur throughout the separate phases  of the narrative until they endow the familiar words with extra  meanings. The whole saga is a study of the misuses of freedom  as well as of bondage, by whites and blacks and part-whites and  part-blacks. What Isaac finally learned was only a seeming  paradox: that the most valid form of human freedom is one  which does recognize the moral bondage holding all members  together in the McCaslin family and even in the human family,  no matter whether the mixture of "black" and "white" blood be  taken literally or as a figurative image of good and evil inextricably joined, in all of us.  Go Down, Moses was published in 1942.

A Defense of Difficulties in William Faulkner's Art					Thompson, Lawrance																											asu0660000008	ner made a more pointed usage of that same theme, by way of  comment on the Emmett Till case. That Negro boy, Emmett  Till, may or may not have whistled at a passing white woman,  but he was tortured and mutilated and finally murdered because  two white men said he whistled. Faulkner was in Italy at the  time, and he could have ignored the scandal. Instead, he searched  out and found a United Press reporter in Rome, and he made  a statement which was printed in most of our newspapers, across  the country. He said in effect that every citizen of the United  States ought to feel a shared sense of guilt and of moral responsibility for the committing of that murder, and ought to be made  to realize that the only way to stop such crimes is to feel it  necessary to do something more than express our shame as  sharers in such a crime.  The difficulties in Faulkner's art always make the reader work  hard to understand Faulkner's implied meanings, but it is  through that required effort that the reader is made to act out  some important parts of Faulkner's meanings about "relationships." The insights on moral values in human relationships, as  reflected in his best writings, are provocative and profoundly  constructive, but those insights become available only when the  reader approaches them through the art which makes them  available. This native of Mississippi had a way of probing human  predicaments, failures, triumphs, in blood-relationships which  involve Negroes and whites in particular, but it was a way which  extended far beyond those blood-relationships to include the  entire family of man.  19 	asu06600000080021001							65802724 Bytes	3848	5697	1470809152	RGB	8	600	asu06600000080021001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/561	561	562.jp2	/asu0660/image/562.jp2
The Gray World of Lionel Johnson					Charlesworth, Barbara																											asu0660000008	THE GRAY WORLD  OF LIONEL JOHNSON  By Barbara Charlesworth  WILLIAM B. YEATS called them "the Tragic Generation." Early in the 'Nineties they had gathered  together at the Cheshire Cheese, conspiring among  themselves to write good poetry. The conspiracy failed. It was  ruined — as conspiracies often are — more by the weakness  of its own members than by the violence or indifference of  those outside it. And so many would say that Yeats exaggerated  in describing the men of the Rhymers' Club as tragic figures;  surely, the argument runs, they were more pathetic than tragic.  Perhaps so in the light of literary eternity. But that early company was so important in Yeats' own life that for him at least  its members had a tragic grandeur, and by the light of his  imagination they acquire a certain splendour.  Of all the members of the Rhymers' Club the one who had  the greatest influence on Yeats may well have been Lionel  Johnson. Yeats describes him as a tiny, frail man who slept  through the day-time and spent his nights reading or moving  silently among his books in a room almost shrouded in gray —  "grey corduroy over door and window and book-case."  The outlines of Johnson's personality are almost as shadowy  as his surroundings. Even his place in literary history is obscure,  for some critics would separate him, althogether from "the  Decadents" of the 'Nineties. Katherine Tynan describes Johnson  as having "the aureoled head of a little saint," thus tacitly withdrawing his name from association with such Decadent  companions as Ernest Dowson or Aubrey Beardsley. Ezra  Pound, while thinking it possible that a man might be both  a poet and a Catholic but still — given human frailty — a  sinner, separates him from the Decadents on stylistic grounds.  His poetry, in Pound's opinion, is hard and clear in its outlines,  free from the "muzziness and softness of most writing in the  'nineties". Certainly it is true that Johnson objected to the  mindlessness of most minor poetry of the time, its tendency to  exist upon "a thin diet of impressions", with its resulting lack  of clarity and order, "all weeping and wailing, all fire and  20  • 	asu06600000080022001							64289300 Bytes	3792	5648	207755728	RGB	8	600	asu06600000080022001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/562	562	563.jp2	/asu0660/image/563.jp2
The Gray World of Lionel Johnson					Charlesworth, Barbara																											asu0660000008	frenzy." And he objected to the crippling self-consciousness of  the writers themselves.  Even when all these things have been considered, however,  one can say that Lionel Johnson was, after all, a "Decadent" in  that he suffered a self-division which he could not resolve, a  fragmentation of his personality which finally destroyed him.  In a stanza of "In Memory of Mayor Robert Gregory" as  Yeats broods upon the old friends now lost to him, he writes:  Lionel Johnson comes the first to mind  That loved his learning better than mankind  Though courteous to the worst; much falling he  Brooded upon sanctity  Yet even these lines, though beautifully succinct and delicate,  especially in their echo of Johnson's "Go from me: I am one of  those who fall", do not, save for that echo, state the truth of  the matter in all its negation: Johnson brooded not on sanctity  but on sin. Although in his schooldays at Winchester he might  say "nothing is common or unclean: there is no sin and no  devil", Johnson was always haunted by a sense of sin. He noted  a similar preoccupation in Hawthorne and liked him for it:  "Blessed," cried Hawthorne, "blessed are all simple emotions,  be they bright or dark: it is only the mixture of them that is  infernal."  But his own miraculous charm comes from his concern for  that mixture.  In 1889 Johnson wrote a poem about Hawthorne, a strange,  dark poem touched by the nihilism that always underlies  Johnson's thought; certainly it seems to be nihilism which  lies beneath the surface of this stanza:  Thou hast both secrets: for to thee are known  The fatal sorrows binding life and death:  And thou hast found, on winds of passage blown,  That music, which is sorrow's perfect breath:  So, all thy beauty takes a solemn tone,  And art, is all thy melancholy saith.  But Johnson could not always find peace in that gray world;  his best poems — best in the sense that they carry the greatest  urgency of emotion, a quality which most of his work sadly  • 21 	asu06600000080023001							65153312 Bytes	3831	5667	496015437	RGB	8	600	asu06600000080023001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/563	563	564.jp2	/asu0660/image/564.jp2
The Gray World of Lionel Johnson					Charlesworth, Barbara																											asu0660000008	lacks — are  those   which   describe   a   violent,   a   Manichean  world of blacks and reds:  That hate, and that, and that again,  Easy and simple are to bear:  My hatred of myself is pain  Beyond my tolerable share  Darker than death, fiercer than fire,  Hatefuller than the heart of Hell  I know thee, O mine own desire!  I know not mine own self as well.  Very often, God seems remote to Johnson, or if He be near,  He comes in vengeance not in love:  I can die. To quit the light,  Hide my misery in gloom  Well indeed! But in that night,  At his voice to meet my doom!  And death's Angels, who may fight?  "The Dark Angel" tries to reach a better and more hopeful  solution; yet again most of the poem is taken up with the  terrible internal conflict of which the resolution is not so much  positive happiness as negative release from torment:  Dark Angel, with thine aching lust!  Of two defeats, of two despairs:  Less dread, a change to drifting dust,  Than thine eternity of cares.  Do what thou wilt, thou shalt not so,  Dark angel, triumph over me:  Lonely, unto the Lone I go;  Divine, to the Divinity.  Johnson does not believe that he will change to drifting dust,  although he wishes perhaps that he did, for a complete materialism would offer one escape; he accepts instead the  complete spiritualism of neo-Platonic thought because, paradoxically, it offers a similar escape from all personality and  with it all sense of sin. What all these, his "central" poems,  show is that Johnson, who had of his own will turned away  from society, found himself separated as well from a sustaining  22  • 	asu06600000080024001							63941544 Bytes	3791	5619	2532521072	RGB	8	600	asu06600000080024001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/564	564	565.jp2	/asu0660/image/565.jp2
The Gray World of Lionel Johnson					Charlesworth, Barbara																											asu0660000008	belief in the presence of God. His attitude to life removed him  from society, his conscience and his fear of death made him  feel very far from God. As a result, he was left in that state of  mind which Eliot describes in "The Waste Land". After the  Thunder's word "DhayadhvanT-sympathize-Eliot portrays the  fate of the man who has not done so:  I have heard the key  Turn in the door once and turn once only  We think of the key, each in his prison  Thinking of the key, each confirms a prison.  As it happens, Johnson once used that very image in one  of the letters he wrote while still a school-boy at Winchester:  "You must forgive my silence, if speech pleases better in this  hollow prison vault of a world, where we fumble and grope  in the dark to find the keys." There is little more than youthful  posturing in the self-consciousness shown here and elsewhere  in the Winchester Letters, the sort of thing that Johnson himself  later satirized. Nevertheless, the letters contain as well examples  of the self-dramatization, the tendency to watch his life "from  the outside" that characterized Johnson all his life, though it  too is one of the traits in literature of the period which he found  at once silly and dangerous. For instance, Yeats' memory of  the way in which Johnson contemplated with strange pleasure  a sudden vision of himself "penniless and shabby, borrowing  half-crowns from friends" has its parallel in this early letter:  I may yet one day in the future before me, waste  away in the ecstatic agony of aspiration and self-  denial: I may yet writhe away to the outer darkness on the shuddering horror of a passion-consumed body: meanwhile I am alive in the summer  heat and flowers and can laugh at the prospect  of either melodrama.  An amusing but also very telling instance of the same feeling  is the following letter to Charles Sayle in which Johnson contemplates his feelings were Sayle to die: Even in death, poor  Sayle is not allowed to take stage-center. He must watch from  the heavenly wings, while Johnson soliloquizes:  If you were to die soon, what should I experience,  what sensation? . . .

The Gray World of Lionel Johnson					Charlesworth, Barbara																											asu0660000008	brances, and associations would flock about me  —it would drift into a Rossettian sonnet—and  fly across  the  summer light and mingle  with  organ tones and flash from gleaming streams and  sigh up from flowers: all the air would become a  melancholy which would cling  and  melt  and  hang: and at last always I should keep the sense  of loss and a pure delight of real sorrow.  This sort of day-dream is entertaining in a young man speculating upon an imaginary emotion, but if the day-dreaming  becomes habitual it can, as Johnson came to see, make for the  destruction of all emotions save those that turn upon the self.  Thus a little story like Johnson's "Incurable," though ostensibly  a satire on the aesthetes, is also a piece of self-analysis. The  story describes a modern poet who decides after considering  all the possibilities open to him, that he must, in fact, commit  suicide. His only regret as he goes about it is that the river he  has chosen for his purpose is water-lily-less. Even without such  props, however, he can imagine himself as a male Lady of  Shalott (in Elizabethan costume) floating down to a heartless  and unthinking London. In the midst of his fantasy he absent-  mindedly falls into the river—and swims strongly back to shore.  Although the satire on the aesthetes is obvious, there is a  very personal sound as well, a note of both self-mockery and  self-pity, in certain passages of the story. He riffles impatiently  through his verses and comes back to the problem:  And why can't I write better?  I know what  imagination is and poetry, and all the rest of it.  I go on contemplating my own emotions,  or  inventing them; and nothing comes of it but this.  And yet I'm not a perfect fool.  Yet no matter how frustrated he is by his self-enclosure, the  poet cannot free himself by taking part in the concerns of the  busy commercial Empire which underlay Victorian society—he  turns away from that: "He would be of no use: if he went out  to the colonies, or upon the stock exchange, he would continue  to write quantities of average and uninteresting verse." Does it  not seem possible that this internal conversation was familiar  to Johnson because he had been speaker and listener in many  24  • 	asu06600000080026001							63845836 Bytes	3799	5600	3005938845	RGB	8	600	asu06600000080026001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/566	566	567.jp2	/asu0660/image/567.jp2
The Gray World of Lionel Johnson					Charlesworth, Barbara																											asu0660000008	similar ones?  Moreover, even though Johnson makes fun of self-consciousness in "Incurable", he shows also, that he knew it to be no  laughing matter, that it could become "a very torment" and  "end in an unnatural state of mind." Johnson's clear and strong  intelligence recognized the danger, certainly, but by the time  it did so, his own tendencies toward isolation and self-contemplation had become habitual; the only way of escape from  himself lay in a retreat to dreams and, lest the dreams fade,  to alcohol.  All this might be unimportant, and Johnson's life might be  dismissed, as Eliot tacitly dismisses it when he alludes to the  "rather untidy lives" of that generation, had Johnson not had  such a deep and permanent effect upon Yeats' thought—and  if upon Yeats, then also upon all those influenced by or reacting  against him.  Johnson, Yeats felt, was among those who taught him that  all the things which we desire or fear, all the things we struggle  for are illusion. Faced with the divisions of life as he saw it,  Johnson retreated from life altogether. Yet his retreat had  dignity and courage, based as it was on a conviction that any  struggle would be meaningless. Lord Francis Russell, who was  also strongly influenced by Johnson, wrote this summary of  his thought:  He (Johnson) . . . taught me a lesson I have  never forgotten, and that is that all the supposedly  real things of life, that is to say the external  things,  the  physical  things,  the  humours,  the  happenings, disgraces, successes, failures are in  themselves the merest phantoms and illusions,  and that the only realities are within one's own  mind and spirit.  "One's own mind and spirit" were an imprisoning reality, but  from that too one would finally be released in the darkness of  God. This was Johnson's desired consummation; until he could  reach it, he lived his quiet yet strangely intense life by night in  a book-lined, shrouded room.  25 	asu06600000080027001							65476932 Bytes	3863	5648	3106781242	RGB	8	600	asu06600000080027001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/567	567	568.jp2	/asu0660/image/568.jp2

The World We Are Heading Towards					Toynbee, Arnold, 1889-1975																											asu0660000012	THE  CARRELL  Volume 6 December, 1965 Number 2  The World We Are Heading Towards  Arnold Toynbee  At the Spring meeting of the Friends of the Library,  Arnold Toynbee spoke on the subject The World We Are  Heading Towards. Professor Toynbee has graciously permitted The Carrell to publish the following excerpt,  slightly edited from a tape recording of the talk.  WHEN ONE is talking of world government one has  to think in practical terms of a government that is  effective, because a government that is not effective  is no government at all. The first essential point of any government is that it should have overwhelming power to make its  decisions prevail, to have its decisions carried out by its subjects.  Even in countries where we call ourselves citizens and not subjects, we really are subjects when we come up against the  government. If we try to defy the government, so much the  worse for us, whether we live in a democratic country or in  an autocratic country—that is part of the nature of all governments. And so it would be with a world government, just as  much as with national governments or with the government  of a state, or county, or parish. And, therefore, we have to  ask ourselves, I think, what, in the present state of the world,  would give a world authority effective power? That is, we must  ask, where does effective power lie in the world today? I suppose 90 percent of the power in the world today lies with about  15 percent of the population of the world—it lies with the  Russo-American 15 percent, not with the non-Russian-and-non-  American 85 percent, which I represent.  So we have to ask ourselves whether we feel that a world  government,  at least for some immediate pressing purposes  • 1 	asu06600000120003001							63368720 Bytes	3776	5592	491861469	RGB	8	600	asu06600000120003001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/576	576	577.jp2	/asu0660/image/577.jp2
The World We Are Heading Towards					Toynbee, Arnold, 1889-1975																											asu0660000012	such as the control of atomic waste and the control of the  production and distribution of food, is the only alternative to  self-destruction. And, if we agree that a government must have  effective power, we have to ask ourselves if there really is a  possibility that the combined power of the United States and  the Soviet Union, cooperating instead of frustrating each other as  they have frustrated each other since 1946, is likely to be put  behind any world authority. Is there any prospect that these  two powers will cooperate with each other instead of checkmating each other? It seems to me, who am neither American  nor Russian—looking at it rather from outside, but not detached,  because the fate of the world depends on what Russia and  America do in our time, so not detached, though from outside  —it seems to me as if the United States and the Soviet Union  do have one very hardboiled common interest in cooperating.  At the present moment the United States and the Soviet Union  have a virtual monopoly of the atomic weapon—a virtual  monopoly because the British atomic weapon doesn't really  count and the French and the Chinese are still in their infancy;  and I have never heard of any nation, or country, or government  which was willing tamely or peacefully to give up power that  it has once had. So I don't suppose that America or Russia will  readily give up their monopoly of atomic weapon power. Yet  their only chance of retaining that monopoly will be to act  together to maintain it. If Russia and America were to act together, they could very quickly put the world in order and keep it in  order, I suppose. I think that was demonstrated in December,  1956, at the time of the attack by my country and France and  Israel on Egypt. You remember that Russia and America didn't  cooperate at that time, but they happened, for once, to have  an identical policy. And the fact that, without cooperating, they  had the same policy and that they both said 'stop' to those three  countries—this was decisive, and immediately decisive, and in  two or three days the attack had been called off. So I think  it is clear that Russia and America, acting together, could put  the world in order. This puts great responsibility on these two  countries, because power does mean responsibility for using that  power in a social and not an antisocial way.  Of course it is a problem to see what they should do to prevent  other powers from getting the atomic weapon.

The World We Are Heading Towards					Toynbee, Arnold, 1889-1975																											asu0660000012	thing to do would be to tell the other powers that you would  jointly destroy any atomic installations they chose to build.  (If they chose to build them in desert and unpopulated places  for the safety of the human race, they could be destroyed  probably with very little loss of human life.)  But in this atomic age to take such violent action is, I believe,  a responsibility that no responsible government (and I think  that both the American and the Russian governments are clearly  responsible governments in this question of the use of the atomic  weapon)—that no responsible government is going to venture  to take. And therefore I believe that the only way that America  and Russia, acting together, could induce other countries not to  obtain the atomic weapon would be by scaling down, by agreement, their own atomic weapons and eventually abolishing them.  Of course I believe that in both the French case and the  Chinese case the motive in trying to obtain the atomic weapon  is not that they really wish to use it to destroy hundreds of  millions of other people but that they feel that this has become  a kind of prestige symbol—it's a very perverse prestige symbol,  but, if you haven't got the atomic weapon, apparently you feel  that way about it, and China, in particular, being a country  with a greater past than any of us have had, and also being a  country which, from 1840 to 1945, was trampled upon and  humiliated by smaller countries like my own or Japan or France  or Russia—China is obviously determined to get back her  position of equality with the greatest nations of the world.  We don't know—I think the American people, and the  Russian people themselves don't know—whether they are going  to be able to cooperate, and if they cannot cooperate and if the  international situation remains for the next 20 years as it has  been for the last 20 years, the world will go through a continuing  period of danger and anxiety. I believe that, in that case, in the  end, some kind of world authority, based on the realities of  power, will be established. But in that event I think it will be  established not by America or Russia or those two countries  combined but by China. I think this because, if you look back,  Chinese history almost forces you to this conclusion.  The Chinese, after all, have been far more successful than  any other people in establishing and maintaining political unity  on a large scale over long periods of time. Of course, in our 	asu06600000120005001							63208272 Bytes	3753	5612	948884210	RGB	8	600	asu06600000120005001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/578	578	579.jp2	/asu0660/image/579.jp2
The World We Are Heading Towards					Toynbee, Arnold, 1889-1975																											asu0660000012	Western background, we have had one notable period of political  unity—the Roman Empire. But the Roman Empire lasted only  a few centuries and then broke up again into the present  fragmentation of our Western national states. And, for us today,  the Roman Empire is unfortunately 'ancient history.' But the  Chinese Empire, established two centuries before the Roman  Empire was, is not ancient history today, but is one of the  biggest living realities in our present-day world.  The Chinese people in the last millennium B.C. were broken  up into a number of local national states like our Western world  today, states which kept on going to war with each other, which  fought more and more devastating wars with each other. And  then, towards the end of the third century B.C., one of these  states conquered all the rest and united the whole Chinese world  into what is really a world state for half the world—the East  Asian half of the world. And, though it is true that, since then,  China has fallen to pieces several times, she has always reunited  sooner or later. She fell to pieces last in 1911, when the Manchu  dynasty exhausted its mandate, as the Chinese say, and was  overthrown. She was reunited by the Kuomintang in 1929 after  a rather short period of disunion and anarchy, and, though the  Kuomintang in turn forfeited its mandate in 1948 or 1949, the  unity of China was not broken up by the substitution of the  present Communist regime in continental China for the Kuomintang regime.  I know that Taiwan is not part of continental China today.  But Taiwan is a very small part of the Chinese patrimony.  Substantially, continental China is China, and continental China  remains united. And the statisticians tell us that by the year  2000 the population of continental China is going to be about  half the human race.  Now the Chinese are just as able as we Westerners are and a  good deal more hard-working than we are. We have often  wondered in the past why it was that, when the Japanese were  so quick in realizing in the 19th century that, unless they adopted  Western weapons, they could not hold their own against the  West, and accordingly acted so quickly in learning the Western  art of war and Western technology, why it was that the Chinese  were so slow. I think the answer is that the Chinese had much  more to lose in giving up their own civilization and adopting  I 	asu06600000120006001							63128276 Bytes	3763	5590	1344078840	RGB	8	600	asu06600000120006001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/579	579	580.jp2	/asu0660/image/580.jp2
The World We Are Heading Towards					Toynbee, Arnold, 1889-1975																											asu0660000012	ours. They thought, I suppose, and rightly in many ways, that  our civilization was inferior to theirs. The Japanese had taken  the Chinese civilization at second hand, so it was not so difficult  for them to change over and take our civilization in turn, at  second hand. It was very painful and difficult for the Chinese  to take this barbarian civilization—as it seemed to them—it took  them more than a hundred years of being kicked about by  Western peoples and finally by Japan, who had superior weapons, to make the Chinese regretfully come to the conclusion that,  to recover their position in the world, they must adopt Western  technology and, above all, Western weapons.  That is the significance, I think, of the Communist regime in  China today, because in China, as in Russia, Communism is a  quick and speedy way of getting even in power with the Western  countries. Now that the Chinese are determined on this and have  put their mind to it, I feel sure that they will succeed and become  a power that will dwarf the Soviet Union and even the United  States. So I believe that, if America and Russia don't succeed  in jointly putting the world in order in the rather near future,  China is likely to perform this necessary service.  The Chinese have one very great asset which we don't have.  Since the downfall of the Roman Empire, which, as I have said,  is now 'ancient history,' our past political background has been  the background of a whole lot of separate local national states.  This is a very unsuitable background for trying to make a unity  of the world. And, in the age of the annihilation of distance and  of the atomic weapon and of modern technology, the human race  can only survive as a unit. Now China's background is much  more favorable for a people who might become the architects of  world unity, because this world-mindedness which is a necessary  psychological preparation for creating world unity is something  with which the Chinese are very familiar — they have been  world-minded for the last 21 centuries. They have thought of  themselves as being citizens of the world-state—in their eyes,  the Chinese state has been equivalent to all of the human race  that counts for anything—and it would be much easier for them  than it is going to be for any of us Westerners to think in world  terms and to put the whole world together into some kind of  world-wide united society. 	asu06600000120007001							63138828 Bytes	3769	5582	1313692637	RGB	8	600	asu06600000120007001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/580	580	581.jp2	/asu0660/image/581.jp2
Before The Beginning and After The End of A Poem					Frost, Robert, 1874-1963																											asu0660000012	Before The Beginning and After  The End of A Poem  Robert Frost  Mr. Frost had no thought of publishing the remarks which  he extemporized at the Winter Institute in 1931. They  were, however, transcribed in shorthand and filed, only  to be forgotten until their recent re-discovery. Unpolished  and imperfectly recorded as they are, they reveal enough  of the vintage Frost to merit publication.  TONIGHT, I am going to read some of the time and  talk some of the time. I have just been thrown with a  distinguished poet visiting here from New England,  distinguished, but not as well known as he might be.* We spent  an evening on a modern theme. We were playing with it all of  the time. He had had three drinks and they brought out what  underlay his mind about me. He was afraid that I had written  too much. I supposed English poets could have gotten together  and tried to outbrag each other as to who had written most.  I claimed that I had written as little as he. "You have written  on subjects that were assigned," is what he meant.  All people who go to school know what it is to have written  on assigned subjects. All newspaper writers know what it is to  go out on assignments. But it seems, now, in the modern view,  that [some weakness] comes in writing on an assignment or even  a self-assignment and I had to ask myself: "Had I written on  subjects or had I not?" But then I accused him of writing on  subjects too. He would have it that there was no thought in his  poetry, that it was without content. And I disagreed.  Now, I am going to speak on that modern prejudice against  having a subject and I am going to speak on another very  modern prejudice at the end, and that is in favor of writing a  poem that shall have nothing in it but what is beyond it. Poetry  is going strong here and I understand so strong that the prose  intelligentsia are up in arms against the poets.  Has thought anything to do with poetry? Some very good men  have said not. A poem should be without thought—without a  subject. How does a poem begin? What is before the beginning  of a poem? I can tell you. I think it might be said that a state  of mind precedes a poem—or a state of nature—which might  ♦Wallace Stevens  ♦ 6 	asu06600000120008001							63321708 Bytes	3775	5588	904265149	RGB	8	600	asu06600000120008001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/581	581	582.jp2	/asu0660/image/582.jp2

Almost anybody who has had  the experience of writing knows what Stevens means by the  visitation of style. That must be something of what he means  by aphasia. It is a sense of worthiness [word-ness?]. Words come  before ideas. Sounds from the mouth come first. We do something to color them. Just words. Probably the thing does begin  in that sort of tendency to make words, phrases and sentences,  etc.—to make shapes. But I begin there—that far back with  any poem. I wake in the morning and go through a day of  hearing sentences starting in my head. I can remember that  many times.  Next, how do I find my way further? I have the whole  dictionary before me—all words that I command, and that is  my next step. Perhaps, I hear first shapes, then words; and then  I am sure for myself and for anybody else that many an idea  and experience are waiting for me, just as words; and there is  an embodiment beyond words, ideas, thoughts, experiences.  Experiences and thoughts are parallel things. I myself never  wrote for a subject, because I had a subject. I never wrote except  on the impulse that I spoke of, but I never would have got far  with the impulse if I had not had the words at my command,  beyond that, experiences, and beyond experiences, thoughts.  So that I am saying that thought is a part of poetry.  We don't give the world up to anyone or any one thing. That  is what is the matter. That thought: Should I write a poem on  it? No. I forget it for a while. I have filled my mind with words  so that I can find a traverse in any direction or [toward] any  object or any goal I want; so I fill my mind with subject matter,  with experiences. I have had a lot which are nothing to me at  the time. Many a poem I have failed in. Why? I have words  enough. The lack is ideas, experiences. I get two steps and there  seems nothing for me to do next. What lies before a poem then?  Thoughts—experiences—of two kinds: Things that happen to  us and things that occur to us. When I start a poem I know that  I have words enough, things enough that have happened to me,  things enough that have occurred to me. There are two schools  of painters: Those who sit in front of the subject and carry it  out, and those who work as I do in poetry—from memory. That  is the answer to this whole question of the subject matter of  poetry. 	asu06600000120009001							63888044 Bytes	3792	5614	3485643718	RGB	8	600	asu06600000120009001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/582	582	583.jp2	/asu0660/image/583.jp2
Before The Beginning and After The End of A Poem					Frost, Robert, 1874-1963																											asu0660000012	After the end of a poem, what is there? What reverberation  is there? Let the people make what more of a poem that they  will. If I had wanted to make more of it, I should have done so.  There is something beyond, over and above the poem and after  the poem. Absurdly enough, it seems to me, people talk about  that beyondness as if it could be achieved without the poem.  The poem has a scattering of words in it, a dimness of thought  and then a defense for it afterward. It is what is beyond that  makes poetry—what is unsaid in any work of art. Its unsaid  part is its best part. We have heard that from the beginning. But  you could not get what is beyond the poem without having the  poem. ... I might have said that the rule that I laid down at  the beginning is the rule that applies more particularly to lyric  poetry. The subject should emerge as the poem is written.  One should not know what to name a poem until he is at least  two-thirds through it. The name very often occurs in the poem  about two-thirds of the way along, in some phrase; and as the  writer writes, he knows that he has found his name. The person  who knows the name of his poem or the end of his poem before  he writes it ought not to write it. And yet, the thing should  emerge as if it had all the enthusiasm of the name, and of the  object's being foreknown. When does a person know what he  means by a poem? When he draws near the end.  Now I want to read "Birches." It is about birches and it is  about ice storms and it is about such other things that have  occurred to me. It has a subject. You can just see the way I  picked the course [core?] out of things that happened, and you  can just see almost the life up to when it was written. Playing  in the country, playing in the town, playing in the schoolyard  —all sorts of things. All you have to say when you start a poem  is, "The Lord will provide." But thought is essential.  You cannot have richness of poetry without the universal  things and the near things piled up like a pyramid. There must  be thought upon thought upon thought. You must be careless,  generous, free. And now three short poems: "Firelights," "A  Peck of Gold," "The Runaway." This last has such a complicated  rhyme scheme that you would have to see it to get anything  out of it. The middle is about college boys. I never would haVe  written the middle of that if I had not seen college boys for the  first time on the upper hand.  • 8 	asu06600000120010001							63659472 Bytes	3787	5600	630056570	RGB	8	600	asu06600000120010001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/583	583	584.jp2	/asu0660/image/584.jp2

The Literature of Economic Policy					Samuels, Warren J., 1933-																											asu0660000012	The Literature of Economic Policy  Warren J. Samuels  THE HISTORY of economic thought is generally the  chronicle of the development of economic theory. But  the practice of theory is to attempt knowledge, and  knowledge—of reality and of values—is a basis of policy.  Accordingly economic theory never has been unrelated to  economic policy: policy questions have been the genesis of  considerable theory, and theory always has had policy implications drawn from it. Moreover, policy choices (valuational  presuppositions) pervade economic theory, just as theoretical  analyses, models and distinctions enter into policy discussions  and decisions.  The status of policy in economics is further illuminated when  it is appreciated that the development of the modern age is  concomitant with the founding and progress of economics as an  intellectual discipline. Modernity is in no small part a matter  of policy-consciousness, which in turn is a facet of the empiricism, relativism, pragmatism, utilitarianism and evolutionism  consequent to what John R. Commons called a "volitional  psychology" and Frank H. Knight, "the liberation of the mind."  Policy consciousness everywhere has been manifest in an increasingly direct confrontation with matters of choice, control  and change, but in no area more markedly than in economic  affairs—reflecting thereby also the ascendency of economic  materialism, or preoccupation with standards of living—and  particularly as related to the economic role of the state. Economic policy is thus a ubiquitous phenomenon, and all modern  societies are preoccupied with it.  But policy—even limited to economic policy—is a heterogeneous and multi-faceted subject. Its characteristics of choice,  control and change—not to neglect conflict—suggest different  things to different people and in different times and situations.  There are also several different levels of and approaches to policy  analysis and discussion, and, moreover, there are both formal  analyses (verbal and econometric) and practical^problems-  oriented studies. 	asu06600000120013001							65402220 Bytes	3824	5699	2595667064	RGB	8	600	asu06600000120013001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/586	586	587.jp2	/asu0660/image/587.jp2
The Literature of Economic Policy					Samuels, Warren J., 1933-																											asu0660000012	It is the purpose of this bibliographical essay to trace something of the scope of economic policy and of the different facets  and levels of policy analysis. The author thus will attempt to  indicate — in no exhaustive manner — some of the literature  reflective of the nature, scope and structure of economic policy.  It should go without saying that the literature of economic  policy is an admixture of statements of fact and of value, both  alleged and recognized, such that any specimen of the genre  will manifest some combination of descriptive analysis and  exhortation.  One limitation imposed upon this survey is that its bibliographical scope is restricted to English-language books and thus,  among other obvious gaps, ignores a substantial and important  journal literature. By way of partial remedy for this particular  omission the attention of the reader is called to the following  partial list of major economic journals: American Economic  Review, Economic Journal, Economica, Journal of Law and  Economics, and, inter alia, Southern Economic Journal The  chief bibliographical sources include the Index of Economic  Journals, the Journal of Economic Abstracts, and the American  Economic Review, which quarterly surveys new books and  periodical articles.  I  The involvement of economic policy and of policy analysis  with the basic problems of philosophy—notably of epistemology  and methodology—is evident throughout the literature, but  especially — and appropriately so — in works concerned with  formal (as distinct from practical-problems) studies. The basic  problems of philosophy that are particularly relevant include  theory construction and verification, the epistemological status  of conclusions, the relevance of metaphysics vis-a-vis positivism  or science, and the theory of value. The problems involved are  as extraordinarily complex and subtle as the literature is rich.  Several relatively recent works bearing on these matters are:  R. Brown, Explanation In Social Science (1964); M. A. Cope-  land, Fact and Theory in Economics (1958); T. W. Hutchison,  uPositive,y Economics and Policy Objectives (1964); I. M.  Kirzner, The Economic Point of View (1960); A. G. Papan-  dreou, Economics as a Science (1958); and J. Robinson,  Economic Philosophy (1962).  • 10 	asu06600000120014001							64547620 Bytes	3798	5663	4061514548	RGB	8	600	asu06600000120014001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/587	587	588.jp2	/asu0660/image/588.jp2
The Literature of Economic Policy					Samuels, Warren J., 1933-																											asu0660000012	Substantively, perhaps the best picture of the scope and  involvements of the field of economic policy is to be derived  from the major texts in the field of Government and Business.  Not only do these indicate the wide scope of the points of  contact between law and economy, but many attempt more or  less sophisticated analyses of the interrelations between legal and  economic processes. Among those that may be consulted are:  C. P. Cotter, Government and Private Enterprise (1960); M.  Fainsod, L. Gordon, and J. C. Palamountain, Jr., Government  and The American Economy (1959); E. S. Redford, American  Government and The Economy (1965); G. A. Steiner, Government's Role in Economic Life (1953); C. Wilcox, Public Policies Toward Business (1960); and D. S. Watson, Economic  Policy (1960). H. R. Smith's Government and Business (1958)  is an historical account of the development of the relations  between government and business in the United States; also  highly worthy of consultation are J. E. Anderson, The Emergence of The Modern Regulatory State (1962), and J. W.  Hurst, Law and The Conditions of Freedom  (1956).  Perhaps the most fundamental analyses of basic problems of  economic policy, however, have been undertaken by several  writers who have, in various ways, attempted to correlate law  and economics, or, as some have preferred to put it, polity and  economy. The major studies are the following: R. T. Ely,  Property and Contract in Their Relation to The Distribution of  Wealth (1914); H. C. Adams, Relation of the State to Industrial  Action and Economics and Jurisprudence (1954); J. M. Clark,  Social Control of Business (1939), and Economic Institutions  and Human Welfare (1957); M. Weber, Law in Economy and  Society (1954); J. R. Commons, Legal Foundations of Capitalism (1959), and Institutional Economics (1959); and R. L.  Hale, Freedom Through Law (1952). Justice requires acknowledgement that there is also an extensive treatment of basic  principles of the interrelation and correlation of legal and  economic processes in the journal literature.  One group of economists that has been primarily concerned  with the legal element of economic policy is the Institutionalists,  largely the tradition developing the work of Commons, already  cited. In general, see: A. G. Gruchy, Modern Economic Thought  (1947); and J. Dorfman, et al. Institutional Economics (1963).  • 11 	asu06600000120015001							64389140 Bytes	3772	5688	1739461484	RGB	8	600	asu06600000120015001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/588	588	589.jp2	/asu0660/image/589.jp2
The Literature of Economic Policy					Samuels, Warren J., 1933-																											asu0660000012	The Libertarian tradition has also produced significant works  exploring fundamental questions of economic policy. See, for  example: W. H. Hutt, Economists and The Public (1936); F.  H. Knight, Freedom and Reform (1947), and Intelligence and  Democratic Action (1960); and F. A. Hayek, Individualism and  Economic Order (1948), and The Constitution of Liberty  (1959).  Also relevant, albeit highly formal, is the field of Welfare Economics, in which the major works include: A. C. Pigou, The  Economics of Welfare (1920); W. J. Baumol, Welfare Economics and The Theory of The State (1952); H. Myint, Theories of  Welfare Economics (1948); I. M. D. Little, A Critique of Welfare Economics (1950); and K. J. Arrow, Social Choice and  Individual Values (1963).  From without the field of economics have come several major  contributions from the literature of Sociology which deserve  mention. Much of this literature is in the tradition of M. Weber,  whose chief work in this connection has already been cited.  See T. Parsons, The Structure of Social Action (1937); T.  Parsons and N. J. Smelser, Economy and Society (1956); and  N. J. Smelser, The Sociology of Economic Life (1963). Written  by an economist from a sociological and interdisciplinary perspective is the ambitious study by A. Kuhn, The Study of  Society: A Unified Approach (1963).  The literature of the history of thought in both economics  and economic policy is extensive. Particularly relevant are:  O. H. Taylor, A History of Economic Thought (1960); B. B.  Seligman, Main Currents in Modern Economics (1962); and  E. Whittaker, A History of Economic Ideas (1940). Also  relevant is the Gruchy volume already cited, and L. Robbins,  The Theory of Economic Policy in English Classical Political  Economy (1953). On the history of thought on economic policy  in the United States the basic source is the magnificent study  by J. Dorfman, The Economic Mind in American Civilization  (five volumes, 1946-1959). Among many other relevant works,  see: M. R. Cohen, American Thought (1954); S. Fine, Laissez  Faire and The General-Welfare State (1956); M. Curti, The  Growth of American Thought (1964); R. H. Gabriel, The  Course of American Democratic Thought (1956); R. Hofstad-  ter, The Age of Reform (1955); and S. P. Hays, The Response  • 12 	asu06600000120016001							62754260 Bytes	3740	5591	1064939897	RGB	8	600	asu06600000120016001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/589	589	590.jp2	/asu0660/image/590.jp2
The Literature of Economic Policy					Samuels, Warren J., 1933-																											asu0660000012	to Industrialism: 1885-1914 (1957). In addition, on early  American economic thought, see: V. G. Wilhite, Founders of  American Economic Thought and Policy (1958); H. W. Spiegel  ed., The Rise of American Economic Thought (1960); and J.  Dorfman and R. G. Tugwell, Early American Policy (1960).  Among the institutions of the market or enterprise economy  are private property and contract. There is appropriately an  enormous literature on these subjects. In the view of the present  author, reference should be made to at least the following:  A. A. Berle, Jr., and G. C. Means, The Modern Corporation  and Private Property (1933); M. S. McDougal and D. Haber,  Propertyf Wealthy Land: Allocation, Planning and Development  (1948); H. C. Havighurst, The Nature of Private Contract  (1961); and F. Kessler and M. P. Sharp, Contracts (1953).  n  The great volume of literature on economic policy, however,  is concerned less with extensive and systematic analysis of formal  problems of economic policy and more with practical problems.  With the increasing participation of government on all levels in  the economic decision-making process—certainly with respect  to the deliberate and direct confrontation with matters of  choice, control and change—, there have developed many specialized fields in which policy analysis is conducted under the  aegis of the particular complex of practical problems extant at  any time. In the following paragraphs a few of these various  fields are indicated and several of the more important and useful  studies are cited in each case. Generally relevant,, however, in  addition to the texts on Government and Business noted above,  are K. E. Boulding, Principles of Economic Policy (1958); and  C. E. Lindblom, (with R. A. Dahl), Politics, Economics and  Welfare (1953) and (with D. Braybrooke) A Strategy of  Decision: Policy Evaluation As A Social Process (1963).  Perhaps the area of government activity of most recent vintage  and of contemporary paramount importance is macroeconomic  supervision of the performance of the economy. In this area,  combinations of monetary and fiscal policy are developed to  regulate the level of business activity (i.e., the business cycle),  the level of prices, and the rate of economic growth. See, for  example, F. M. Bator, The Question of Government Spending  (1960); M. J. Bailey, National Income and The Price Level  • 13 	asu06600000120017001							63864928 Bytes	3792	5612	2831476398	RGB	8	600	asu06600000120017001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/590	590	591.jp2	/asu0660/image/591.jp2
The Literature of Economic Policy					Samuels, Warren J., 1933-																											asu0660000012	(1962); R. A. Gordon, Business Fluctuations (1961); and  R. L. Heilbroner, Understanding Macroeconomics (1965).  The antitrust laws, and other regulations governing business  behavior, have long been subject to studies examining governmental structuring of the marketplace. See F. Machlup, The  Political Economy of Monopoly (1952); M. S. Massel, Competition and Monopoly (1962); and E. S. Mason, Economic  Concentration and The Monopoly Problem (1957)—all generally in the field of antitrust. For other aspects, see: W. Adams  and H. M. Gray, Monopoly in America (1955); E. Latham, The  Group Basis of Politics (1952); M. D. Reagan, The Managed  Economy (1963); and E. V. Rostow, Planning For Freedom  (1959).  In the field of labor relations, see L. G. Reynolds, Labor  Economics and Labor Relations (1959). In transportation and  public utilities, see D. P. Locklin, Economics of Transportation  (1960); M. G. Glaeser, Public Utilities in American Capitalism  (1957); and E. S. Redford, ed., Public Administration and  Policy Formation (1956). On agricultural policy, see D. E.  Hathaway, Government and Agriculture (1963).  The reader should be apprised that further references to these  and other fields of practical problems of economic policy are to  be found in the bibliographical lists and notes presented in most,  if not all, of these volumes, as well as in the texts on Government  and Business. In addition, basic texts in the principles of economics usually survey the leading areas of policy, as well as the  primary fields of theory; as, for example, in G. L. Bach,  Economics (1963).  m  It is appropriate to conclude this bibliographical survey of the  literature on economic policy with some indication of significant  recent works beyond those already cited. Not unlike many of the  preceding citations, these works are a blend of description and  prescription-proscription. See: M. Friedman, Capitalism and  Freedom (1962); J. K. Galbraith, The Affluent Society (1958);  C. B. Hoover, The Economy, Liberty, and The State (1961);  W. Ropke, Economics of The Free Society (1963); O. H.  Taylor, The Classical Liberalism, Marxism, and The Twentieth  Century (1960); and H. C. Wallich, The Cost of Freedom  (1962).  • 14 	asu06600000120018001							64590556 Bytes	3844	5599	3480506789	RGB	8	600	asu06600000120018001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/591	591	592.jp2	/asu0660/image/592.jp2
The Literature of Economic Policy					Samuels, Warren J., 1933-																											asu0660000012	Yet there remain vast and important areas of contemporary  economic policy here untouched—from the war on poverty to  international monetary reform to economic development policy  to natural resource policy, to list but a few. If the author,  however, by having indicated fields of study and imagination-  striking titles, has helped stimulate interest in policy analysis,  then he will have accomplished his purpose. It should be apparent, moreover, that the reader can approach any subject of  economic policy from several directions. There is a considerable  literature in such fields as political science, sociology and anthropology, jurisprudence, history, and psychology that bears on  problems of economic policy. While economic policy analysis,  like economic theory, can be abstruse it is almost never self-  contained: the ramifications of questions of economic policy  lead to these other areas of study. In many cases, these areas  are involved directly and immediately. This means that the student can find considerable material in some other social science  area with which to begin or to supplement his study of economic  literature. One point, of course, is the truism that the reader  should begin where he is the most comfortable.  Finally, it may be pointed out that a primary benefit of studying economic policy, or of conducting economic policy analysis,  is the enlightenment one derives in the form of greater sophistication about and understanding of current problems and issues  of policy. While economic policy analysis will not yield unambiguous, conclusive or unequivocal solutions to policy problems,  such study should facilitate understanding of fundamentals and  thus of the truly basic—as distinct from the immediate—issues  of policy.  15 	asu06600000120019001							64373364 Bytes	3808	5633	983336252	RGB	8	600	asu06600000120019001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/592	592	593.jp2	/asu0660/image/593.jp2
About the Cover ...					DuPriest, Bill																											asu0660000012	About the Cover...  AFTER the sea-change effected by Hurricane Betsy, there seemed little possibility  that Alabama Jack could rebuild the  fishing camp on Card Sound that had borne his  name.  Two walls and a roof, a torn-up concrete floor  were nearly all that remained. The long bar (with  the hottest peppers this side of Hell), the juke box  (with the loudest music), the boat docks, and the  boats had disappeared, and sundry fishing shanties  had blown away, leaving only their pilings. Rental  skiffs were to be seen lodged in the top of a mangrove tangle; dozens of larger boats were awash  or lay askew in the swamp on either side of the  causeway. The road to the camp, broken by the  waves, was a litter of sargassum weed and eel grass,  electrical wiring and steel cables. Dead snapper and  mullet stank in the after-storm sun.  But Jack, who, as a construction crew-man, had  helped build the Empire State Building and had  later spent twelve years making his camp a legendary place in South Florida, is not of a kind to brood  impotently on a packing case for any length of  time. Not long after this picture was taken, the  clearing away began and, in due course, the reconstruction. Now, for those who care for them,  the beer and the bean soup, the fish dinners in the  sunset, the peppers and Elvis Presley are again  available. And there are many who care for them.  Which goes to show that sometimes there is a  tide in the affairs of men which, taken at the ebb,  leads on to fortune.  —Bill DuPriest  16 	asu06600000120020001							63905084 Bytes	3808	5592	3969600715	RGB	8	600	asu06600000120020001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/593	593	594.jp2	/asu0660/image/594.jp2

What Was The Matter With Jacob Barnes?					Skipp, Francis E.																											asu0660000012	What Was The Matter  With Jacob Barnes?  Francis E. Skipp  ERNEST HEMINGWAY was a conscientious student of  Gertrude Stein's. He brought her all the early work  before it went off, and he found her criticism rigorous  and penetrating. "Gertrude was always right," Hemingway later  told John Peale Bishop, and meant it. But Ernest Hemingway  was always very much his own man, and the critical component  of the fiction writer's mind was always active in those early  years. When Miss Stein looked down at Hemingway and some  of his expatriate contemporaries clustered about her knees and  pronounced them a lost generation, the pronouncement was  preserved to become an epigraph to The Sun Also Rises. But  the young novelist coupled to it a quotation from Ecclesiastes  which begins, "One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh; but the earth abideth forever."  The novel dramatized a number of lives in ways that seemed  to confirm the truth of Gertrude Stein's observation. And the  character of those lives was of a sort which might have provoked  the censure of a latter-day preacher. The novel and its epigraphs  have been read from the date of its appearance to our own day  as a cry of despair, as a kind of Waste Land in prose without  the thunder and the damp gust of rain.  It has been pointed out that Hemingway had read the Eliot  poem, and that there are correspondences between Count Mip-  pipopoulos and Eliot's Smyrna merchant, Mr. Eugenides, between Georgette Hobin, the whore with the bad teeth, and  Eliot's Lil or the "dead mountain mouth of carious teeth,"  between Eliot's upper-class couple, seeking an anodyne to their  boredom in a chess game, and Mike Campbell and Brett Ashley,  dissolving their boredom in alcohol, or even between the church  of San Fermin at Pamplona where Brett became "nervy" and  had to leave and Eliot's Chapel Perilous. Jacob Barnes, wounded  in his genitals, is a kind of Fisher King in the desert of contemporary civilization. What Bertrand Russell called "secular hurry-  ings through space" generally has been seen as describing the  • 17 	asu06600000120023001							64226092 Bytes	3795	5638	1979508023	RGB	8	600	asu06600000120023001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/596	596	597.jp2	/asu0660/image/597.jp2
What Was The Matter With Jacob Barnes?					Skipp, Francis E.																											asu0660000012	novel's particular actions, and despair to characterize its total  implication.  Philip Young, to be sure, took a different view in his critical  study Ernest Hemingway (New York, 1952). There Young  pointed out that although "pessimism arises eloquently out of the  novel's structure, it does not seem to rise out of the day-to-day  action at all," and this in spite of the fact that "here is the  protagonist gone impotent, and his land gone sterile." Hemingway, Young said, seems to lose sight of Jake's disability and  must remind himself that it exists, and added that "one's net  impression today is of all the fun there is to be had in getting  good and lost" (p. 59).  Perhaps Philip Young overstates the case for The Sun Also  Rises being a joyous book, but his retrospective reassessment  of the book leads, I think, to a better understanding of the book  and of the function of Jake Barnes in particular. Because in  retrospect it is the character of Jake which stands out in contrast  to the others—to their will-less-ness, their nymphomania, their  alcoholism, their affectation, their selfishness, their egoism.  Jake, as we recall him, seems to know himself, even though  he is rebellious enough toward life to act in defiance of that  self-knowledge again and again. There is no mistaking his easy  self-confidence, a self-confidence apparent from the first as he  lines-in the character and recent history of Robert Cohn. Here  as elsewhere he is often sardonic and in his analysis of character  he is even surgical. To be sure, he finds that "it is awfully easy  to be hard-boiled about everything in the daytime, but at night  it is another thing." Yet, he has come to terms with his life.  "I've had plenty to worry about one time or another," he tells  Robert Cohn. "I'm through worrying."  Jake clearly enjoys life. When Cohn suggests a weekend  walking trip, Jake is able to offer a number of alternative  suggestions, each implying particular knowledge and previous  experience, and above all, keen pleasure. The fact that the trip  never comes about is a consequence of Cohn's crippling liaison  with a mistress he cannot find the courage to leave or defy.  Jake stands out above the other expatriate Americans in Paris.  Woolsey and Krum, foreign correspondent colleagues of Jake,  share a taxi with him from the Quai d'Orsay to the newspaper  office and show themselves, in contrast to Jake, sunk in domesti-  • 18 	asu06600000120024001							63920284 Bytes	3789	5620	4201404641	RGB	8	600	asu06600000120024001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/597	597	598.jp2	/asu0660/image/598.jp2

Joining the  Braddocks, Robert Cohn and his mistress Frances Clyne, and a  number of other Americans for coffee at Lavigne's, Jake shows  himself to be intensely aware of everything around him. He is  never dull, never abstracted. His world is sharply in focus for  him.  At the dancing club in a bal musette which he attends with  the coffee party, Jake watches the arrival of Brett Ashley. She  is in the midst of a group of homosexuals. They recognize the  girl with Jake as a prostitute and, as a daring joke, dance with  her. Jake, moved by Brett's beauty, watches disgustedly as the  young men dance with his poule, his simple physical impotence  standing in strong contrast to their complicated psychological  impotence.  Jake is introduced by Mrs. Braddock to a Robert Prentiss.  "He was from New York by way of Chicago," Jake tells us,  "and was a rising new novelist. He had some sort of an English  accent. I asked him to have a drink.  "Thanks so much," he said, "I've just had one."  "Have another."  "Thanks, I will then."  We got the daughter of the house over and each had a  fine a Veau.  "You're from Kansas City, they tell me," he said.  "Yes."  "Do you find Paris amusing?"  "Yes."  "Really?"  I was a little drunk. Not drunk in any positive sense but  enough to be careless.  "For God's sake," I said, "yes. Don't you?"  "Oh, how charmingly you get angry," he said. "I wish  I had that faculty."  Jake does find Paris "amusing." He enjoys the city for what  it is, and he despises this Signor Pococurante who from affectation cannot heartily do the same. The ambiguous Count Mippi-  popoulos says to Jake, "You see, Mr. Barnes, it is because I  have lived very much that now I can enjoy everything so well.  Do you find it like that?" Jake has been around more than a  little, though perhaps not so much as the Count. "Yes," Jake  • 19 	asu06600000120025001							64091200 Bytes	3798	5623	1306826108	RGB	8	600	asu06600000120025001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/598	598	599.jp2	/asu0660/image/599.jp2

Skipp, Francis E.																											asu0660000012	replies, adding perhaps to humor the Count, perhaps as a wry  though delicate touch of self-commiseration,  "Absolutely."  From Paris the action of the novel shifts to the Spanish  mountain resort of Burguete and its Irati River. The consecutive  effort necessary to carrying out a plan has been too much for  the frantically dissipated energies of Brett and Mike. Robert  Cohn in calf-eyed fatuity waits at Pamplona for Brett. Jake  and his good friend, the young American novelist Bill Gorton,  proceed to enjoy their holiday of fishing. At the river Jake and  Bill live an idyll, Corydon and Piscator, and in one sustainedly  humorous dialogue find emotional release that even the mention  of Brett's name cannot dam. As they leave Burguete after five  days of fishing and return to Pamplona for the fiesta, the  Englishman, Wilson-Harris, with whom they had fished on two  occasions, presents them each with an envelope of flies he has  tied himself. The gesture is one of affection and of gratitude for a  brief friendship which has lifted the Englishman from a war-  induced somberness to a joy in living the more poignant for its  transiency. Jake and Bill are touched, and the reader is touched  too.  In Pamplona the sombre events to come cast their shadows  early. Jake Barnes does much to redeem the time by giving to  the others what he can of his own subtle appreciation of the  corrida, but he is dragged down with the rest in the debacle of  Brett's affair with the bullfighter Romero. The fiesta ends and  Jake goes into a spiritual retreat in a spare hotel room in a  Spanish town where the streets are cool and shady-damp, only  to be called to the rescue in Madrid by Brett, whose affair has  ended, and whose resources, physical and spiritual, are depleted.  All that she has been able to salvage from Romero's departure  is a self-congratulatory feeling for having given him up in his  own best interests. "You know it makes one feel rather good  deciding not to be a bitch," she says. "It's sort of what we have  instead of God." Jake, who had abandoned his attempt to  worship in the church of San Fermin when Brett felt the  impropriety of her presence there, who deprecated himself as "a  rotten Catholic," replied, "Some people have God .... Quite  a lot."  But Jake, never remotely the missionary for any cause, attempts no rescue of Brett except in the most literal sense.

What Was The Matter With Jacob Barnes?					Skipp, Francis E.																											asu0660000012	realizes that she has lost her capacity to use even her good qualities in a non-destructive way. "Isn't it pretty to think so?" Jake  says in the book's last line, replying sardonically to Brett's  belief that their life together would have been good.  Perhaps this is the point of lowest energy for Jake. His great  love—with reservations—has been Brett. Brett's great love is  Jake, but he is emasculated. If indeed Jake's emasculation is  symbolic of the sterility of a civilization, Brett must be seen as  containing possibilities which, if fertilized, would bring forth a  culture in which life could again be rich, creative, and significant.  But this possibility is assuredly denied in the reply, "Isn't it  pretty to think so?" Brett is sterile, but her sterility is metaphorical, psychological, not literal. Jake's impotence is quite literal.  It is not metaphorical, psychological, or spiritual. He is the novel's  most creative character, and this is why Hemingway emasculated  him—to create irony in all of his relationships—with Krum and  Woolsey, with Robert Prentiss and the Braddocks and Frances  Clyne, with the Englishman Wilson-Harris and Robert Cohn,  with Mike Campbell and Brett Ashley, and, at the fringes of  things, the American ambassador and the Biarritz crowd. Jake  although physically impotent is essentially creative. The others  are physically sound, but for one reason or another they are  sterile, unable to find abiding love or to fulfill their own promise.  Hemingway was always to be much more of an ironist than  symbolist. Indeed, it is through irony that he achieved his most  powerful effects—and his most affirmative. From the irony of  Catherine Barkley's death Frederick Henry walks out into the  rain, but we know that he will survive and be "stronger at the  broken places." Harry Morgan, gut-shot and dying, is mistaken  for a criminal conspirator rather than the hero he is, but his  death dramatizes the faith that "no man alone now" can confront the world, that common men must unite if they are to  prevail. Robert Jordan, knowing his heroically conducted  guerilla action to be bootless because the Loyalist cause has  been betrayed in high places, immobilized with a broken leg,  calmly awaits death at fascist hands, certain that the world is  worth fighting for. And old Santiago, victorious in his greatest  defeat, convinces us in his last acts that life for the man with  courage and humility never ceases to be a growth as well as  a becoming.  • 21 	asu06600000120027001							63707484 Bytes	3763	5640	1006907927	RGB	8	600	asu06600000120027001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/600	600	601.jp2	/asu0660/image/601.jp2
What Was The Matter With Jacob Barnes?					Skipp, Francis E.																											asu0660000012	And so the irony of Jacob Barnes's real potency permits us  to hear an affirmative note in his words, "Isn't it pretty to think  so?" Because from them we can see that he has learned an  important lesson. Jake had disclaimed the hope of learning  "what it was all about," making his modest objective only  "getting to know how to live in it." The irony of his demonstrated  creativity makes us feel, as the novel ends, that he will work  out a modus vivendi not wholly successful, perhaps, but successful within the conditions imposed by his world.  It is well to remember, however, that Jake Barnes is not the  only character who can focus his energies and use them creatively. Bill Gorton is a successful novelist who savors life with  Jake's gusto. And this is scarcely to be wondered at, for Hemingway used John Dos Passos as the model for his characterization of Gorton. Harold Stearns, Harold Loeb, Lady Duff Cooper  may have been as "lost" as their counterparts in the novel, but  Dos Passos was not. Nor was Hemingway. Nor were those other  major writers whose work first appeared in the 'twenties—William Faulkner and Thomas Wolfe.  Perhaps Scott Fitzgerald thought of himself as one of "the  lost generation," for when he and Wolfe talked in Switzerland  in 1930 Fitzgerald insisted, "You belong to it too. You came  along at the same time .... You're a part of it whether you  want to be or not." "To which," Wolfe said to a literary banquet  at Purdue in 1938, "my vulgar response has been, 'Don't you  yoo-hoo me!'"  Thomas Wolfe was right in refusing to take a posture of  despair. The record shows that Scott Fitzgerald as well as Wolfe  and the others remained productive artists in spite of the forbidding character of the world which their fancy endowed with  form. For "the lost generation," whatever its failures, was responsible for the most excellent decade that American literature has  seen in more than a hundred years.  22 	asu06600000120028001							64037960 Bytes	3805	5608	3697991294	RGB	8	600	asu06600000120028001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/601	601	602.jp2	/asu0660/image/602.jp2

History Is Where You Find It					Tebeau, Charlton W.																											asu0660000015	THE  CARRE L L  Volume 8 June, 1967 Number 1  History Is Where You Find It  Charlton W. Tebeau  A professional historian who had written several books  on Florida subjects lamented, "The well has run dry.  There are no more subjects." A college student curious  about a subject in local history went to the card catalogue in the  library, found nothing under that title, concluded further search  would be futile and abandoned it. A teacher searching frantically  for class paper topics for which materials were available drew  almost a complete blank. There simply wasn't anything to be  suggested or assigned. A college graduate, perhaps the holder  of a graduate degree, accustomed to great archival and library  resources, but deprived of them when he leaves the university,  finds the wellspring of historical curiosity and creativeness drying  up for lack of sustenance.  None of this need be true. Another student, teacher, researcher, scholar, author, or ordinary but inquiring citizen finding himself in a new situation begins to exploit whatever is there.  The newcomer is always at an advantage over the long-time  resident to whom the community large or small is a familiar  story. The recent arrival is curious about what he sees and  hears and he begins to ask questions. Soon there is a story  whether or not it ever is written; the potential for history is there.  Poverty of mind and imagination arise first from a too  limited definition of history which excludes anything not considered significant, not documented in traditional references.  Others may never think of history as anything outside books  and  documents  assigned  in  classes  as  textbooks  or  library 	asu06600000150003001							64067628 Bytes	3789	5633	1610268658	RGB	8	600	asu06600000150003001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/609	609	610.jp2	/asu0660/image/610.jp2

Contrast with that James Harvey Robinson's definition of history as everything man has ever said, thought, or done.  He did not require that the person, the word, or the act be important or have any measurable effect on the course of human  history.  This poverty also arises from lack of curiosity about people  and their doings. There is rather general agreement among the  critics of modern historical writing that people have disappeared  from it, that vaguely defined but powerful economic and social  forces or determinants beyond the control of the individual account for all human behavior, make up the subject matter of  history. I think that I am first of all interested in people and that  this interest finds an outlet in history, particularly in local history.  History is more than information. It is the meaningful story of  people in action.  It may very well be true that history has been written backward in most instances. The general history has been written  first. The earliest effort at state history is likely to read much  like the national history with the rest of the country left out.  Only as more local studies are made can meaningful state history  be written. The same may be said of regional history. The first  textbook history of the south, by W. B. Hesseltine (A History  of the South, New York, 1936), differed little from the history  of the nation except that other regions were left out of it. Subsequently when more research had been done at the local and  state level, Hesseltine with co-author David K. Smiley brought  out new and improved editions in 1943 and 1960. The same  development may be observed in the successive editions of  Francis Butler Simkins, History of the South, (New York, Knopf  1947, 1953, and 1963).  The attractiveness and value of the Rivers of America and the  Lakes of America series lies in the local color and human interest.  Alfred Jackson and Kathryn Abbey Hanna did an excellent book  in the Lakes series on Lake Okeechobee, Wellspring of the Ever-  glades. Lawrence E. Will of Belle Glade had lived and worked  on and around Lake Okeechobee for a half century. He had  collected notes and photographs on all stages of development  since the first efforts to reclaim Everglades land there.

When I suggested  that he write a history of Lake Okeechobee and the surrounding  area, he replied that the Hannas had already written the book.  I urged that he write the book behind the book they had written.  He started out to write an article on the 1928 hurricane that  grew into a small book.

He has moved  out on the prairie to do a book on the open range cattle industry.  This poverty arises too from failure to recognize the sources  of history when one sees them. They need not be in the form  of documents with a government imprint on them, nor books  with a reputable publisher's imprint. There are archaeological,  literary, photographic, and oral sources around in overwhelming  abundance.  A local case in point: we have only begun to learn about the  aboriginal Indians in South Florida who left no written record.  Nor do we have adequate accounts of their lives by discoverers  and early visitors. Yet we have a better knowledge of their life  than we do of that of early white settlers. Archaeologists and anthropologists learn it from the artifacts they left behind in kitchen  middens, ceremonial mounds, burial mounds, and refuse heaps  of any kind. These Indians lived an almost completely self-  sufficient life in isolation from all other people. Nature was  bountiful in some things and stingy in others. Of food there  was plenty. They could live the year around without planting  anything or migrating with seasonal changes. On the other hand  there was no metal or hard stone. Hence they used bones, shells,  and vegetable fibers for buildings, tools, weapons, and ornaments.  Investigations, collections, and interpretations are only now  being made. These subjects can be studied at only a few of  our colleges and universities. There's a wealth of material at our  doorstep, particularly in the Everglades National Park.  It is too easy to assume that there are no literary records of  frontier life. The first settlers are not likely to write much and  much of that little will be lost. Yet there are surprising exceptions. I did a small book on one of the Ten Thousand Islands  that has been inhabited since the middle of the last century. 	asu06600000150005001							63630704 Bytes	3766	5630	1575152782	RGB	8	600	asu06600000150005001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/611	611	612.jp2	/asu0660/image/612.jp2

McKenny, a better than usually educated man for  such a venture, moved there and wrote a weekly column for  the Fort Myers Press with some regularity until his death in  1926. Adolphus Santini came to the island at about the same  time and kept a diary with daily entries until he moved away  in 1899. Each day he reported on the wind, direction and velocity, and the weather, important items to farmers and operators  of sail boats. The material is tediously repetitious, but few communities in the United States have their complete history so well  documented. To round out the story, Charles S. Smallwood, who  came to the island in 1906, later wrote a narrative account of  his experiences there. The real point of this story for us is that  people thinking only of conventional sources in the usual places  for them might easily have missed these, and they might more  easily have been lost and never come to anybody's attention,  Other documentary sources are more obvious, but sometimes  forgotten. Abstracts of title often provide important clues as to  dates of settlement as well as to names of settlers. Surveyors'  field notes are sometimes more than descriptions of metes and  bounds. They may describe the soil, timber, wildlife, or other  natural features, or mention an abandoned clearing or homesite.  The minutes of school boards and county commissioners frequently tell us things about the social life of the community.  The school board in Lee County, Florida, in the eighties of  the last century charged a teacher with working in his garden  on Sunday. His defense was not the assertion of his right to do  so, but a denial that he had been weeding the tomatoes. He was  only walking through the garden, but promised thereafter to  refrain from even the appearance of such deadly evil. Deeds,  wills, baptismal, marriage, birth, and death records, and tombstone inscriptions all provide the bits and pieces that make up  local history.  Photographs, possible only in the last century, have great  value. They tell a story often better than words. They are an  open sesame almost anywhere when a researcher is seeking interviews. It is not from the pioneer settlers on the lower west  coast of the Florida peninsula that one gets them, but from  visiting yachtsmen, hunters,  and fishermen who undoubtedly  • 4 	asu06600000150006001							63751936 Bytes	3788	5608	1147644539	RGB	8	600	asu06600000150006001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/612	612	613.jp2	/asu0660/image/613.jp2

I have  frequently been able to supply people photographs of themselves  at an earlier date, or of their families, of which they did not  suspect the existence. The great tragedy is that too often the  photographs are not dated and the subjects not identified.  Various well-endowed oral-history projects are another measure of what may be done in the collection of sources. There is  nothing new about this, but techniques such as electronic recorders make it more effectually done. A century ago Hubert  Howe Bancroft sent interviewers out to gather written and oral  records of pioneer settlers in the Rocky Mountain and Pacific  Coast states, while first settlers were still there. He thereby  saved for the Bancroft Library at the University of California a  priceless record. Interviewing is no simple task. I am frequently  asked why we do not send new graduate students out to interview pioneers. To begin with, an interviewer must know almost  as much about the subject as does his informant. He must know  what questions to ask and how to evaluate what he hears and  follow up leads. No questionnaire has ever been devised that  will cover all possibilities that may arise. There is a vast amount  of folklore and sheer fantasy in what one hears, and memory  is not reliable. I have concluded that all fishing and hunting  guides like the conductors of tours come to believe the stories  they tell. They probably develop this skill to entertain clients  when weather is bad, fish don't bite, and game can't be found.  The priceless value of the interview is the leads which can be  followed and the insights into information gathered from other  sources.  I submit that local history is the best laboratory in which to  learn what history is by writing some. It can be done at any  grade level. It actually involves a greater variety of skills than  is likely to be required of the professional historian writing of  larger events. I learned this lesson by experience long after I  had completed my formal education in historical method in  graduate school. When I started the study of Collier County,  the second largest in area in the state, it had less than five  thousand inhabitants. I wondered what I'd write about to make  a book-length story. I felt compelled to go back into Indian 	asu06600000150007001							37856422 Bytes	3784	5624	4218942191	RGB	8	600	asu06600000150007001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/613	613	614.jp2	/asu0660/image/614.jp2

Study of Indians brought forcibly to my attention  the intimate relation between them and the natural environment,  so, working backward, I found the starting point in knowledge  of the physical features and the human uses of the natural assets.  In terms of skills this meant geology and geography and  biology. The next involvement was in archaeology and anthropology, the story of primitive man learned through artifacts  he left. Finally, since several language groups were involved in  the white man's discovery, exploration, and settlement it became desirable to know French and Spanish sources. Because  place names are frequently a garbling of two or more languages,  the study of their origins is a fascinating subject. If we knew  the true origin of all place names the extent and sureness of  our knowledge would be vastly increased. It might turn up such  gems as Green River Swamp named for a pile of Green River  Bourbon bottles left by a club which had a hunting camp on  the edge of the swamp.  The organization of the American Association for State and  Local History and its activities, the growing number of local  and county historical societies and museums engaged in the  collection, preservation, and use of these scattered and too often  overlooked materials, attest the growing importance of local  history and its sources. This new interest in local history may  arise from an increasingly mobile and uprooted people, searching  for identity in the grass roots of their adopted communities.  The moral for the friends of the library is obvious. Scarcely  any record of human activity, whatever its form and condition,  may be rejected or discarded. It will have value for some questioning student at some time. 	asu06600000150008001							63870824 Bytes	3785	5623	1017783707	RGB	8	600	asu06600000150008001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/614	614	615.jp2	/asu0660/image/615.jp2
Verisimilitude and Vision: Defoe and Blake as Influences On Joyce's Molly Bloom					Novak, Jane																											asu0660000015	Verisimilitude and Vision:  Defoe and Blake as Influences  On Joyce's Molly Bloom  Jane Novak  Leopold Bloom's pleasant but apparently trivial memory  of his wife Molly unclamping the busk of her stays is a  fusion of details vulgarly commonplace, comically human, and domestically sexual:  Could see her in the bedroom from the hearth. . . . White  . . . Swish and flop her stays made on the bed. Always  warm from her. Always liked to let herself out. Sitting  there after till near two, taking out her hairpins. Milly  tucked up in the beddyhouse. Happy. Happy. That was  the night.l  Throughout Ulysses Joyce pours forth such random recollections  in the shorthand of his characters' individual associative patterns.  The elliptical technique, materially concrete and psychologically  accurate, produces credible creatures; Molly Bloom is as dear  and dirty as Dublin, as solid and ordinary as her own orange-  keyed chamberpot.  But through Joyce's power to arrange and relate such processes and confusions of thought while he is at the same time  maintaining their fine, free flow, a vision emerges which achieves  what Richard Ellman terms "the justification of the commonplace." Molly Bloom "in the cream gown with the rip she never  stitched" becomes at last "the spinning earth," as large and  irresistible and holy as life itself. The triumph is that this recognition is accomplished without apotheosis; Molly remains mundane while becoming mythical. Her natural and her supernatural  reality are simultaneously manifested; she is magnificently comic  as a result. In her final rush of transcendent affirmation ("the  female word 'yes' "), she does not forget to calculate the effect  of her perfume upon her lover.  1 Ulysses, New York, 1961, p. 156.

Verisimilitude and Vision: Defoe and Blake as Influences On Joyce's Molly Bloom					Novak, Jane																											asu0660000015	The synthesis of meanings is even more complex than that  of character and concept in The Divine Comedy; there is an  essential identity between the vivid reality of such a character  as Dante's Belacqua, sharply sketched in colloquial language  as "the heap . . . who seems so all-let-down," and the universal  figure of Indolent Man which he represents. Inglorious Molly  Bloom, on the contrary, who has been scornfully described as  dishonest, uncreative, infertile, and lacking in enough elan vital  to get dressed before three in the afternoon,2 nevertheless attains  glory as Woman Incarnate, a slattern Gea-Tellus.  How does Joyce create this ambivalent reality? Richard Ell-  man explains the unifying principle behind the paradox by  saying, "Joyce's discovery, so humanistic that he would have  been embarrassed to disclose it out of context, was that the  ordinary is the extraordinary."3 (His embarrassment makes the  human comedy necessary; the hairpins deflate the sentiment.)  Joyce himself, in a letter uncharacteristically devoid of self-  mockery, described his purpose to his brother Stanislaus: "Don't  you think there is a certain resemblance of the mystery of the  Mass and what I am trying to do? I mean that I am trying to  give people some kind of intellectual pleasure or spiritual enjoyment by converting the bread of everyday life into something  that has a permanent artistic life of its own." Thus, even chyle  and dung have meaning in the cyclical, sacramental universe of  Ulysses. For a kind of transubstantiation does occur; the foul  flux of the physical is sanctified by Joyce's self-styled sense of  "the significance of trivial things." (And at the same time the  filth comically reminds us that we are more Yahoo than  Houyhnhmn.)  The power which performs the miracle is produced by two  currents which at first seem to be in conflict but which prove  instead to be polarized; their pull against each other produces  both the tension of opposites and the strength of unity. To label  these poles as naturalism and symbolism, as does Edmund Wil-  2J. Mitchell Morse, "Molly Bloom Revisited," James Joyce Miscellany, Second Series, ed.

Verisimilitude and Vision: Defoe and Blake as Influences On Joyce's Molly Bloom					Novak, Jane																											asu0660000015	son, is a convenient critical oversimplification. It is more difficult  and rewarding to study the field of their interaction and to see  Joyce at work, in his own words, mediating "between the world  of reality and the world of dreams."  One way of examining the process of mediation is to consider  the creation of Molly Bloom in the light of Joyce's own lectures  on realism and idealism in English literature. In March, 1912,  when he was in the early stages of writing Ulysses, he spoke at  the Universita Popolare Triestina of "Verismo ed idealismo nella  letterature inglese—(Daniele De Foe—William Blake)." His  linking of the two, representing extremes of technique and vision,  is eloquent, and the Mason-Ellman critical introduction to the  Blake lecture (only a fragment remains) explains the relation  of both to Joyce's own work:  Joyce's resemblance to Defoe is clear enough, and he is  closer to Blake than may first appear. While he took  pride in grounding his art on brute, honest fact, he insisted  also on the mind's supremacy over all it surveyed. Beyond  these specified resemblances, his lectures suggest two specific affinities. Defoe and Blake, in their different ways,  were working with the conception of archetypal man. Robinson Crusoe summarizes a people and a time as Bloom  does, Blake's Albion, the universal man who symbolizes  eternity, is related to that other giant form, Finnegan, in  whose life, death, and awakening Joyce finds all human enterprise and aspiration.4  It is not pressing the point to find affinities as well between  Molly Bloom and Moll Flanders, between Molly Bloom and the  Daughters of Albion. In "Penelope," Molly's extended interior  monologue, the landscape of her consciousness is as solid as  Crusoe's island, yet its darkness is as mysterious as Leutha's  vale; the concreteness of her experience is Defoe-earthy (ordinary), but the psychic energy she emanates is cosmic-Blake (extraordinary).

Verisimilitude and Vision: Defoe and Blake as Influences On Joyce's Molly Bloom					Novak, Jane																											asu0660000015	pointing, and symbolism reveals the greater complexity of vision  such devices require and manifest. Close comparison of Moll  Flanders and Molly Bloom reveals the similarity of their limited,  matter-of-fact, practical egotism and the dissimilarity of the  powerful subconscious drives which shape their actions. Finally,  understanding of these differences leads to insight into Blake-  Joyce archetypal visions of the universe and of Woman as a  complex creature. We see Joyce skillfully creating Molly Bloom  in a perceptual world like that of Defoe, then implying, like  Blake, that reason cannot comprehend the shape of her reality.5  To begin with, Joyce's sense of the everyday world required  the creation of Molly's dirty, shiny stocking sole and the raw  power of her vanity. To convey this kind of verisimilitude he  needed the skills of Defoe—the ability to observe coolly and to  record memorably the prosiness of physical experience and the  indefatigable activity of the human ego. His friend Frank Budgen  tells us that to improve his own natural talents as a realist Joyce  had studied the master journalist whom he praised to the Italian  audience for &lt;(suo verismo prosaico." "For Joyce was a great  admirer of Defoe," wrote Budgen. "He possessed his complete  works and has read every line of them."  In his lecture Joyce expressed this admiration as well as some  sense of identification with the woes of Defoe which paralleled  his own (staggering debt and an inability to find a publisher for  his masterpiece). Though denying that Defoe's "life stories" were  "true novels" because of their lack of "love plot, psychological  analysis and the studied balance of characters and tendencies,"  he yet called them "literary documents in which the soul of the  modern realistic novel is glimpsed like the soul that slumbers  in an imperfect and amorphous organism."6  As prime proof of Defoe's genius as a realist Joyce cited his  creation of the three anti-sentimental female characters whose  5The concept of Blake's vision in this paragraph makes use of a reworded phrase from Northrop Frye, "Introduction" to Selected Poetry  and Prose of William Blake, New York, 1953, xxiv.  6James Joyce, Daniel Defoe, ed. from Italian ms. and translated by  Joseph Prescott, Buffalo Studies, I, No. 1 (December, 1964), 18.

Verisimilitude and Vision: Defoe and Blake as Influences On Joyce's Molly Bloom					Novak, Jane																											asu0660000015	indelicacy "reduces contemporary criticism to stupefied impotence"—Mother Ross, "the adventureless Roxana and the unforgettable harlot, Moll Flanders."  He goes on to praise two realistic narrative devices which  he was himself to use in a considerably more complex form in  his own creation of Molly: (1) the meticulous enumeration of  small details, and (2) the undifferentiated juxtaposition of incidents greatly differing in importance.  Joyce analyzed the first device by referring to the narrative  of Defoe's The Storm which "like a great snake, begins to crawl  slowly through a tangle of letters and reports." He concludes:  The modern reader does a good deal of groaning before  he reaches the conclusion, but in the end the object of  the chronicler has been achieved. By dint of repetitions,  contradictions, details, figures, noises, the storm has come  alive, the ruin is visible.  Joyce often worked in the same fashion. Possessing the identical patient, uncritical curiosity, he was fascinated by the amassing of trivial, miscellaneous information; he said of himself, "I  have a grocer's assistant's mind." Once he wrote his Aunt Josephine Murray, "Send me any God damn drivel you may  remember."  The accumulation of such "drivel" in Ulysses does not indicate  a lack of artistic discipline. Joyce wrote of his method: "It would  be easy for me to write short novels if I chose, but what I want  to wear away in this novel cannot be worn away except by  constant dropping." The effectiveness of Molly's interminable  repetitions is cumulative; her monologue forces us to acknowledge that as a result of the constant dropping "Molly has come  alive, the Woman is visible."  This plethora of detail must be distinguished from another  device in which Joyce delights—the Rabelaisian-Sterne-like  parody of the scholarly catalogue, a mad, disorderly, climactic,  anti-climactic list. In contrast, the Defoe detail is produced by  statistical inventory and homely observation, declaring both the  ground-level awareness of the observer and the market value  of what he observes.  • 11 	asu06600000150013001							63698100 Bytes	3764	5639	4274006669	RGB	8	600	asu06600000150013001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/619	619	620.jp2	/asu0660/image/620.jp2
Verisimilitude and Vision: Defoe and Blake as Influences On Joyce's Molly Bloom					Novak, Jane																											asu0660000015	But multiplicity of concrete detail (or as Ellmann says, "the  art of surfeit") is only part of Joyce's narrative method; his  complex symbolic patterning of the detail makes Defoe's "contradictions and repetitions" seem clumsy. Joyce, moving from  mind to mind, overloading every rift with ore, differentiates  between the kind of detail each separate consciousness records  as well as the influence of the physical state accompanying the  thought process.  For example, in the Lestrygonian episode, Bloom, at all times  conscious of the material world, as well as being a man in search  of food, sees every sight, enjoys every memory in terms of the  digestive process. Molly Bloom, on the contrary, sees all experiences as a series of personal and sexual triumphs and consequently remembers most details in the context of genital functions  or as physical accessories or challenges to her own attractions.  One would be hard put to it to distinguish between the nature  of the details observed by Robinson Crusoe and by Mother Ross;  both see the world with the eye of the shrewd practical individualist.  Sometimes there seems to be no clear chronological or logical  key to the relationships of details in Ulysses; often the associa-  tional clues are suppressed for pages or chapters before the  insight to their relevance is provided. Yet Joyce may be counted  on in most cases to follow the mystery writer's rule: Bury now  to dig up later. Thus, Bloom's morning musings on his cat seem  unimportant enough, although they shed some light on his humanity and humility, on his respect foi all creation. But observe  the relationship between the underlined passages.  Bloom looks at his cat:  They call them stupid. They understand what we say better  than we understand them. She understands all she wants  to. Vindictive, too. Wonder what I can look like to her.  Height of a tower? No she can jump me (p 55).  Later:  The cat went up in soft bounds, Ah, she wanted to go  upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed (p. 68).  But much later, Molly, curled up in a ball on the bed, thinks:  • 12 	asu06600000150014001							65716076 Bytes	3862	5670	2601855260	RGB	8	600	asu06600000150014001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/620	620	621.jp2	/asu0660/image/621.jp2

Verisimilitude and Vision: Defoe and Blake as Influences On Joyce's Molly Bloom					Novak, Jane																											asu0660000015	and I love to hear him falling up the stairs of a morning  with the cups rattling on the tray and then playing with the  cat she rubs up against you for her own sake I wonder  has she fleas she's as bad as a woman always licking and  lecking but I hate their claws I wonder do they see anything that we can't staring like that when she sits at the top  of the stairs and listening (p. 764).  And adds of Poldy a little later on:  yes that's why I like him because I saw he understood or  felt what a woman is and I knew I could always get  around him (p. 782).  At once Bloom's earlier attempt to "see or understand" what  the cat was, his respect for its selfish intelligence, his understanding of its lack of awe of him, his acknowledgement of its malice,  and his realization of its ability to "get around him" makes the  cat "as bad as" Molly.  Further use of the vignette is made in Molly's comment on  her daughter Milly: "I couldn't turn around with her in the place  unless I bolted the door" (p. 766); the cat's relationship to Molly  becomes that of another woman spying on her.  Each detail is set, like those in Defoe, solidly in the context  of the moment's physical experience, yet because of the underlying web of relationship, each eventually assumes a larger significance. Like Blake, Joyce reveals the world in a grain of sand.  To illustrate the second device Joyce cites with admiration  a passage from The Life and Entertaining Adventures of Mrs.  Christian Davies, commonly called Mother Ross (characteristically "adapting" it somewhat). Joyce explains:  Christian, who is a pretty little Dublin pubkeeper, abandons her demijohns and, donning men's clothes, wanders  all over Europe in search of her husband. She finds him  at the Battle Hochstat, but in the meantime he has taken  a Dutch mistress. The scene of the meeting between  Christian and her faithless husband in the room at the  inn presents the eternal feminine in an unexpected light.  Here it is, Christian herself speaking:  I saw him in the room with the Dutch woman, but  pretending not to see him, I went to the landlady and  desired to be shown a private room. She went before me  into the room and bringing me a pint of beer which I  •  13 	asu06600000150019001							63640824 Bytes	3750	5655	3982514955	RGB	8	600	asu06600000150019001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/625	625	626.jp2	/asu0660/image/626.jp2
Verisimilitude and Vision: Defoe and Blake as Influences On Joyce's Molly Bloom					Novak, Jane																											asu0660000015	called for, left me alone with my melancholy thoughts. I  sat me down, laid my elbow on the table, and leaning my  head upon my hand, I began to reflect . . . But why is he  thus changed? . . . And his fondness for the Dutch woman  gave vent to my tears, which, flowing in abundance, was  some relief to me. I could not stop this flood, which continued a good quarter of an hour. At length it ceased, and  drinking a little of the hougarde (which is a white beer, in  colour like whey), I washed my face and hands with the  rest, to conceal my having wept. Then, calling my landlady, I desired that she would bring another pint.  The ironic humor of the dead-pan recital, the admirable resilience and cool courage of Christian plainly delighted Joyce.  Always ready to applaud the undercutting of romanticism, he  exclaimed with pleasure, "Different from Tristan and Isolde!"  The remarkable evenness of emotional tone creates the comic  effect; the similarity between this monologue and Molly's is unmistakable. Both brilliantly portray the human ego restoring its  equilibrium with practical efficiency. Essentially "Penelope" is  just such an exercise; while musing on the dependability of her  own sex appeal, the loss of a pair of gloves in the ladies' room,  her husband's perverse habits of love-making, the inconveniences  and joys of her flesh, the death of her infant son, and the contemplated purchase of new underwear—all with no apparent  change in intensity of feeling—Molly maintains (sometimes with  a slight effort of adjustment) a monumental sense of her own  rightness. Every suggestion of self-doubt is at once suppressed.  Through the same blandly unimaginative, matter-of-fact, self-  centered point of view, Christian, Moll Flanders, and Molly  Bloom maintain their sanity; the final effect of their insensitive  egotism is heroic.  But the difference in the concept of the human personality  and the nature of Woman which lies behind the characterizations  of Moll and Molly is profound. Although both women command  respect for their buoyancy, tenacity, shrewdness, resourcefulness,  health, and honest vulgarity—good bourgeois qualities which insure their survival and predict their eventual triumph in a man's  world—Molly's infinitely greater mystery moves her away from  Defoe's heroine in the direction of Blake's symbolized aspects  of Woman:  Enitharmon, Queen of Heaven; Vala, vegetable  • 14 	asu06600000150020001							65930600 Bytes	3863	5687	315357722	RGB	8	600	asu06600000150020001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/626	626	627.jp2	/asu0660/image/627.jp2

Although Molly's monologue seems superficial and shallow,  it hints of all the forces in her nature which oppose the logical  picture of existence offered by Moll Flanders. The sexual drives  which shape the actions of the Eternal Female are more elemental, more difficult to analyze, than the sensible, materialistic  motives of eighteenth century Economic Woman, "thoughtful,"  as Moll said, "of the main chance."  The greater psychological depth of Joyce's portrait which  makes Molly Eternal Woman is illustrated by contrasting the  feminism of Moll and Molly. In his Defoe lecture Joyce described  Moll Flanders as a prototypal Mrs. Pankhurst. And it is true  she has the indefatigable aggressiveness of the suffragette. However, her attitude toward men is not conditioned by sexual antagonism but by economic pressure.  For Moll sees men as (1) providers or (2) business competitors. Another Defoe heroine expresses a similar assessment of  man's true worth to a woman in this account of the discovery  of a suicide's body by his wife:  The child's screams alarmed the mother, whom running  up with some others of her children, saw the distracting  sight; the poor woman was inconsolable, for she not only  lost a husband she loved, but saw herself by that loss  deprived of bread with eleven children to maintain.  Sentiment here is barely a half-step ahead of self-preservation.  And Moll, in a like vein, though often affectionate and sometimes passionate, never fails, after her first instructive seduction,  to compensate for possible heartache by checking her lover's  purse. Her dealings with men always have a financial side. Like  that other great bourgeois heroine, Pamela, Moll counts chastity,  or counterfeited chastity, a marketable commodity, and she anti-  romantically poetizes to a suitor, "But money's virtue, gold is  fate."  Always conscious of a woman's disadvantages as a trader,  Moll advises a friend to use her wits boldly as a compensation  for the handicap of being female; she says "that if the men made  • 15  ■h 	asu06600000150021001							63961748 Bytes	3787	5628	2782687204	RGB	8	600	asu06600000150021001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/627	627	628.jp2	/asu0660/image/628.jp2

So what prompts the  feminism of Moll Flanders is not hostility toward men but a  bold determination to yield them no ground in the market place.  Molly Bloom's attitude toward men lacks such logical consistency; she is by turns coy, scornful, fond, strategic, contemptuous, maternal, triumphant, disgusted, amused, possessive, and  libidinous. Her feelings toward Stephen, whom she imagines  simultaneously in the role of son and lover, typify the confusions  which her mental wanderings record. Molly Bloom's view of  men is stable in but one respect; she sees life as a series of encounters between herself and an aroused male.  Her feminism is based on her infantile egotism; she thinks  women superior to men—and herself superior to other women.  Her resentment of them is caused by offenses to her dignity and  aesthetic pretensions and by her hatred of masculine violence;  Boylan's coarse slap on her rump enrages her.  However, though her physical desires carry few connotations  of tenderness (like the cat "she rubs up against you for herself"),  she is more than the personification of lust. Molly is "a flower  of the mountain." Coarseness and all, she is part of the natural  order. Her animal hunger is a force to be reckoned with, capable  of simultaneously defeating and freeing the cerebrating male.  Thinking of Woman, Bloom softened: "A warm human plumpness settled down on his brain. His brain yielded. Perfume of  embraces all him assailed." As in the Blakean Woman, the drives  which lie behind Molly's adventuring are both creative and  destructive; they are not accessible to a value system such as  Moll's or even clearly comprehended by Molly herself.  Further contrast in the complexity of the characters is apparent  in the rhetoric of the two self-preserving monologues. Taking  stock of her situation at one point, Moll says:  Now as fame and fools make an assembly, I was here  wonderfully caressed, had an abundance of admirers, and  such as call themselves lovers; but found I had not one  fair proposal among them all. As for their common design,  •  16 	asu06600000150022001							64152436 Bytes	3792	5636	3222165854	RGB	8	600	asu06600000150022001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/628	628	629.jp2	/asu0660/image/629.jp2

The case was altered with me; I had  money in my pocket, and had nothing to say to them. I  had been tricked once by that cheat called love, but the  game was over; I was resolved now to be married or  nothing, and to be well married or not at all . . . Thus my  pride, not my principle, my money, not my virtue, kept me  honest; . . .  Here is a rational woman, conscious of a morally judgmental  reader, calmly recounting her "wicked adventures" in a straight  chronological line, without nuance of emotional coloring. The  paragraph is a model of sober induction from experience, a  practical essay on the problems of husband-hunting by a woman  who has learned her lesson about the financial risks of free love,  and subsequently repented of the false values of cynicism.  The cool reasoning power which informed her business  acumen, is equally applied to the emotional problem of guilt. By  a marvelously objective act of self-judgment which anticipates  the horror of her Puritan reader and identifies with it, she cuts  herself off from the past as though she were discussing another  person. Yet in repentance she has not changed her essential  nature; her present piety is plain, but it is as pragmatic as her  former pride.  Moll Flanders' method of thinking, communicating, living is  governed by practical logic; it is ordered and controlled by  economic pressures and selfish good sense. Likewise, the narrative method of her story is ordered, straightforward, reasoned,  and frank. There is no confusion or ambivalence here, only the  thorny problem of the degree of authorial intention behind the  ironies of her candor.  On the other hand, the rhetoric of the forty-five page "Penelope" is eight unparsable, breathless, illogical sentences, tirelessly meandering between past and present, a fluid stream of  night thoughts, afloat with the flotsam and jetsam cast up by  memory, imagination, the senses, and emotions. This river lies in  the region of the Four Zoas, and like the Liffey, it is "lovely  and dirty." It denies the Cartesian separation of mind and body  on which Moll Flanders' final judgments are predicated.  The difference in manner and meaning is plain when we  •  17 	asu06600000150023001							63520984 Bytes	3758	5631	780358364	RGB	8	600	asu06600000150023001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/629	629	630.jp2	/asu0660/image/630.jp2
Verisimilitude and Vision: Defoe and Blake as Influences On Joyce's Molly Bloom					Novak, Jane																											asu0660000015	compare Molly's mechanisms of emotional self-preservation with  those of Moll. Molly thinks of her own actions in one fashion  only—the sheer, brute force of her self-love, deeply and triumphantly irrational, establishes her permanently beyond social  judgment.  She celebrates hedonism ("let us have a bit of fun first"),  natural impulses ("if that was her nature what could she do")?  and justifies both by citing general hypocrisy ("doesn't everybody only they hide it"). Momentary yielding to any kind of  guilt ("no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches"), is followed immediately with successful  excuse and evasion ("I suppose its all the troubles we have  make us snappy Im not like that").  The complexity of Molly's rhetoric reproduces the complexity  of the whole human psyche. The material details are as carefully  recorded as those in Defoe, although the values are different.  (To Moll a gold bracelet represents a financial asset, to Molly  a sexual accessory.) The understanding of the power of human  selfishness is as deep in both writers, but only Joyce portrays  the darker workings of the subconscious which lie behind selfish  action.  For Joyce, like Blake perceiving with "the eye of his soul"  and "the eye of his mind," visioned the geography of the interior  world—deep, dark, timeless—a creation in which man's nature  strives against itself in mysterious cycles of creation and destruction. Both Blake and Joyce found this world indescribable in  Defoe's lucid, cerebral language "from which," said Joyce, "the  star of poetry is absent"; both described the land of the unconscious with the symbolic language of myth and dream.  Joyce drew on Blake. The "Circe" episode of Ulysses and  Finnegans Wake are studded with allusions to Blake's poetry  and to An Island in the Moon; "Penelope" less obviously reflects  Blake, but the sympathy of vision is profound. For Molly Bloom  lives by the peculiar wisdom of the Proverbs of Hell: "The  nakedness of woman is the work of God," "The road of excess  leads to the Palace of Wisdom," "Exuberance is Beauty," "Damn  braces. Bless relaxes/' And the mystery of her passions is that  • 18 	asu06600000150024001							63482896 Bytes	3772	5608	4205209813	RGB	8	600	asu06600000150024001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/630	630	631.jp2	/asu0660/image/631.jp2
Verisimilitude and Vision: Defoe and Blake as Influences On Joyce's Molly Bloom					Novak, Jane																											asu0660000015	of the Manichaean marriage of Heaven and Hell. (Joyce saw  the same duality in his wife, Nora: "One moment I see you like  a virgin or a madonna. The next moment I see you shameless,  insolent, half-naked and obscene.")  And there are further Blake-Joyce affinities in "Penelope."  Molly's memorable fancies resist the dogma and prudery of  Urizen and Nobadaddy. The running theme of sexual freedom  echoes the cry of the Daughters of Albion, "girls of mild silver  or furious gold," who long for the pleasures of "a freeborn joy."  Blake rebelled at the conventions which bound with briars his  joys and desires; Joyce was bitter about "cruelty masqueraded  as highminded moralism and timid onanism masqueraded as  purity."  Both Blake and Joyce believed that it was by the intuitive  imagination of the artist seeing through and beyond perceptual  experience into the darkness that some light on man's nature  might come. Ulysses is a quest for such insight, a voyage often  as confusing and tortured as Blake's most esoteric writings. Its  chief characters may be seen as Blake's Four Zoas: Stephen as  mind, Bloom as the senses, Molly as the passions, and Joyce  himself as the imagination.  Such a vision raises Molly to a superhuman sphere, and Joyce's  pleasure was always in "heightening her into someone beyond  herself, then pulling her back to 7 Eccles Street." He pulled her  back neatly in his description of her character in a letter to Frank  Budgen; he found her "perfectly sane full amoral fertilisable untrustworthy engaging shrew limited prudent indifferent Weib."  This spate of adjectives returns us to Moll Flanders and to  Molly's real prototype, Joyce's wife, Nora Barnacle.  Nora's invulnerability to Joyce's genius baffled him; he struggled to invade what was for him her maddening simplicity. At  one point, after declaring himself to be "some sort of personality," he said with comic pathos, "But my wife's personality is  absolute proof against any influence of mine." After five years of  living with her, he wrote her, "What do you think of me at all?"  and at one juncture complained peevishly to Stanislaus, "As a  matter of fact I know very little about women. ..."  * 19 	asu06600000150025001							63415992 Bytes	3752	5632	1009887248	RGB	8	600	asu06600000150025001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/631	631	632.jp2	/asu0660/image/632.jp2
Verisimilitude and Vision: Defoe and Blake as Influences On Joyce's Molly Bloom					Novak, Jane																											asu0660000015	Obviously Joyces sense of Nora as both ordinary and extraordinary is a more important source for Molly Bloom's creation  than the works of Defoe and Blake. But he needed the techniques  and insights of both to bring her to life. And in the course of  using them simultaneously new insights and techniques peculiarly  Joycean, peculiarly right for Molly Bloom, developed.  Joyce was aware of the process of a similar interaction of influences in Blake. In the Trieste lecture he described him as the  disciple of "two spiritual masters, very different from each other."  Swedenborg's influence, he explained, stamped Blake's work with  a vision of "glorified humanity." Michelangelo's influence rescued  him from the realms of mysticism by insistence on "the pure,  clean line that evokes and creates the figure on the backdrop  of the uncreated void."  Although not his only spiritual masters, Defoe and Blake acted  in the same way upon Joyce's creative imagination. And the  contrast between their influences is the essence of Molly Bloom's  success; it is the discrepancy between the Defoe-like portrayal of  her mediocre intelligence and the Blake-like vision of the primeval forces at work in her that gives us the Joycean humor and  mystery of Molly transferring the bit of seed cake from her  passionate, gluey mouth to Bloom's.  20 	asu06600000150026001							63868372 Bytes	3795	5608	203626147	RGB	8	600	asu06600000150026001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/632	632	633.jp2	/asu0660/image/633.jp2
Album de la Isla Cuba Pintoresca					Abella, Rosa M.; Nunez, Ana Rosa																											asu0660000015	Album de la Isla Cuba Pintoresca  Rosa Abella and Ana Rosa Nunez  Federico Miahle, Doctor of Science, member of the  French Academy, engraver and notable landscape painter,  was born in France in 1810 and went to Cuba around  1850. He succeeded Leclerc, another Frenchman, in the Directorship of the National School of Fine Arts, "San Alejandro,"  in Havana. He was there for seven years and his sojourn in the  Island left an indelible impression in the world of arts. He was  the illustrator of the Album de la Isla de Cuba Pintoresca (La  Habana, 1853), which contains twenty-five lithographs.  Miahle was a friend of various illustrious Cubans who deeply  appreciated his gifts. Together with Garner ay and Leplante he  formed the group of French engravers who produced a body of  work of real importance in Cuba. Lolo de la Torriente says of  him in her Estudio de las Artes Plasticas en Cuba (La Habana,  1954): "Miahle left an extensive collection of engravings in  black and white and in color, some of them printed in the Lito-  grafia de Marquier in Lamparilla 96. In the Oficina del His-  toriador de la Ciudad are kept some of these engravings, most  of them printed in La Habana on his own printing machine, such  as the one of El teatro de Tacon; El Paseo de Isabel II; El quitrin;  El Panadero y el malojero; La Puerta de Monserrate. Other  lithographs were taken from natural scenes in the interior of  the Island. . . . El Paseo pintoresco por la Isla de Cuba is considered today a rare book. There are only two complete copies  of it."  Miahle was deeply impressed by what he saw in Cuba, especially by the promenades, churches, monuments, and other  buildings in Havana. His representations of street scenes give a  sense of the vividness of life in a colonial society that was developing its personality, its "criollismo."  Miahle favored the splendid—public buildings and churches  —but he found a place in his work for the sponge fisherman and  his primitive shack, for lovers seen through colonial iron windows, for the street vendor.

It is, however, in his engravings of the different ports of the  Island that Miahle captures a sense of the tropics. The waters,  the lights, the royal palms, the quitrin show Cuba for the subtropical paradise (environmentally) that it is. Like the detailed  scenes of Havana, these are important not merely because of  their artistic value, which is evident, but also because of the  historical, geographical, sociological, and economic information  which they provide. Life in nineteenth-century Cuba can be  evaluated by study of these engravings. Miahle did not have the  keen and understanding approach of the German naturalist  Alexander Humboldt. But he saw, with his French eye, everything that was to be seen in Cuba and reproduced it with great  felicity.  22 	asu06600000150028001							64003832 Bytes	3795	5620	1919250948	RGB	8	600	asu06600000150028001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/634	634	635.jp2	/asu0660/image/635.jp2

Puritanism and Modern American Art					Ward, Robert S.																											asu0660000014	THE  CARRE LL  Volume 7 December, 1966 Number 2  Puritanism and Modern American Art  Robert S. Ward  The image of the Puritan as an enemy of the arts and  their creators has become so firmly planted in the  American mind that the positive contributions of Puritanism in this area have been egregiously under-estimated. The  purpose of this paper is to correct that distorted view.  The first contribution of Puritanism to modern American art  which I have to suggest is a feeling of high seriousness, an attitude that art should succeed in communicating intense emotion,  passion. What I have in mind was exemplified by Mr. Robert  Frost's answer when asked whether he agreed with Carl Sandburg  that poetry was a racket; Mr. Frost indignantly denied any such  attitude. He said, "Carl knows better than that. It's the most  serious thing there is!" So too Aunt Mary Moody Emerson found  mere fiction insipid to a mind touched with immortal views. It  is what Matthiessen had in mind when he wrote, "Certainly the  principal element in what Eliot means by the poet's 'sense of  his own age' is, as we have seen, the way in which he is able  'to express the greatest emotional intensity of his time, based  on whatever his time happened to think.'"  It is the attitude of Henry James—expressed in the Tragic  Muse—of reverence for art sufficient to justify his hero's giving  up England's most distinguished political post and England's  most desirable woman for art. This attitude contrasts severely  with the European tradition of Amateurism, that no gentleman  can keep his social position and devote himself completely to 	asu06600000140003001							63971108 Bytes	3797	5614	2846470979	RGB	8	600	asu06600000140003001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/642	642	643.jp2	/asu0660/image/643.jp2
Puritanism and Modern American Art					Ward, Robert S.																											asu0660000014	artistic effort. It seems to me that there is little question that  modern American Art demands intense emotional feeling of its  practitioners. But how does that stem out of Puritanism? My  answer is that piety was in 1620 the dominant aspect of Puritanism; an ecstatic love of God exhausted the Puritan's capacity  for intense feeling. For its sake he was ready to desert home  and fortune to risk everything in the American wilderness. Religion was the Puritan's outlet for passion; his art was—like  most Renaissance art—merely polite entertainment. He gave to  religion what we give to art. And he knew that sublime emotion  alone is not enough; to achieve the highest value it must be  disciplined, must have order, and here again he was in the middle  between extremists. On the one hand there was the High Churchman, who from the Puritan's point of view had approached  Papistry in burying passion under lifeless ritualism; to the Puritan  the high church Fideism lacked the leaven of intellect and had  too little intrinsic order to be art. On the other hand were the  "enthusiasts" who had feeling in excess and utterly without discipline; the Quaker, the Anabaptist, Anne Hutchinson hearing  voices from God, were too utterly lawless, too uninformed to  be the real thing. So the Puritan set himself to the task of expressing his intense feeling in a new church, the Congregational;  a new ritual; a new literary form, the Puritan sermon; a new  intellectual form, covenant theology. Throughout the Seventeenth Century the development of these new forms presented  sufficient outlet for their energy, but by 1700, that energy had  in England been diverted into new channels. English Puritans,  like Newton, Locke and Boyle, weary of theological strife, threw  themselves into the new experimental philosophy; the Royal  Society, the Principia, and the Essay on the Human Understanding were forthcoming. In America, Cotton Mather wrote the  Christian Philosopher, and, as soon as Wolfe's victory at Quebec  had left them free to do so, the Puritans turned to putting all  their capacity for intense feeling into a love of political liberty;  their literary efforts turned from the sermon to political propaganda and eventually into the framing of a Constitution. The  Puritan Conscience kept itself occupied in cheering for the  popular revolts against monarchy throughout the world until 	asu06600000140004001							66636268 Bytes	3901	5692	2501692317	RGB	8	600	asu06600000140004001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/643	643	644.jp2	/asu0660/image/644.jp2
Puritanism and Modern American Art					Ward, Robert S.																											asu0660000014	the excesses of The Reign of Terror gave them pause; then as  some turned to Abolition, others turned to the fine arts for expression, looking to Transcendentalism for the values which  Congregationalism had once afforded them. Emerson asserted  the high function of the Poet as Seer possessing the highest power  to receive and to impart. Walt Whitman—reading Emerson—  bubbled over, and following Whitman our modern poets accept  high seriousness and a capacity to express intense emotion as  essentials of their art. Faulkner rebuked Hemingway for not  having attempted more exalted tasks than those he knew himself  able to accomplish and prided himself upon his own failures.  Frank Lloyd Wright read Emerson too.  Next in importance after high seriousness among the contributions of Puritanism to our modern art is anti-authoritarianism.  I feel that modern art is characterized by a revolt against traditional authority and that it was Puritanism which paved the way.  The Lutheran doctrine of the priesthood of true believers was  developed by Calvin and the Puritans, who believed that all men  had enough of the vestiges of reason, even after Adam's fall, to  read God's Word and understand it and that—although saving  Grace was obtained through Faith alone—the faithful had to  understand for themselves what they had faith in. They cast off  the authority of either church, Roman or Anglican, in theological  matters. Here the New England Congregationalist was more  liberal than the Presbyterian Puritan, placing final authority in  the individual church and in a majority vote of that church.  The only authority which Congregationalism recognized was that  of God's Truth as embodied in Scripture and in the Universe.  To be sure, the New England Way was more authoritarian than  the Quaker Way or the Antinomian Way, in that it demanded  educated thinking and restricted individual thinking to the limits  of the plain meaning as attested by the common sense of all the  faithful, but so was Emerson to say that the true Poet informs  us not of his wealth but of the Common Wealth, and his Self-  Reliance could only be confident in its assurance that what was  true for him would in time be true for all men. So Walt Whitman  sang himself, but uttered the word "en-masse."

Puritanism and Modern American Art					Ward, Robert S.																											asu0660000014	never has embraced individualism with a capital I. Baseball is  not likely to be replaced by cricket.  Next after high seriousness and anti-authoritarianism among  the contributions of Puritanism, I place "organic form"; the  belief that artistic form should be natural, that it should be  formed by the inner structure of what it had to express, found  its place in the Puritan philosophy, not in rhetoric, but in logic,  the art of deriving God's truth from nature. As William Ames  put it: "Art is primarily and most properly in things. . . ." The  notions of logic no more originate in the human mind than do  the subject matters of physics or mathematics. Arguments are in  things, axioms are "not first in words nor properly in the mind,  but in things" and the order of the axioms set up by method  is not a contrivance of human ingenuity, but "the order of things  which they have in their own nature." The rational order of  objects in the created universe, as discovered by logic, is the  same order that prevails in the rightly reasoning intellect. So it  was that the Puritan in seeking out God's truth insisted upon  shaping it in his mind in a form corresponding to the form God  had implanted in things. Moreover he felt that this form should  be retained in the expression of truth: therefore, in his sermonizing it was logic not rhetoric that shaped the statement of doctrine and its supporting reasons; rhetoric was confined to the  functional application, to the uses. So when John Cotton, brilliant young orator of Emmanuel College, shocked the throng  who had gathered to hear him discourse, by substituting the  Puritan plain style for the ornate discourse modeled on that of  John Donne and Lancelot Andrewes, the listeners pulled the  brims of their hats down over their eyes, but—before the reasons  were over—at least one of them sat up, cocked his hat back,  opened his soul to God's truth, and divine Grace flowed into  him. When Emerson passed from sermonizing to poetizing, the  Puritan in him led him to assert that it is not metres but a metre-  making argument that makes a poem, and in the hands of Walt  Whitman free verse became established as the most effective  medium for modern poetic expression. I might even suggest by  way of paradox that it is the Puritan in Mr. Frost that leads him  to compare composing in free verse to playing tennis with the  1 	asu06600000140006001							65847300 Bytes	3891	5639	94377236	RGB	8	600	asu06600000140006001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/645	645	646.jp2	/asu0660/image/646.jp2
Puritanism and Modern American Art					Ward, Robert S.																											asu0660000014	net down. Certainly the underlying assumptions of Sandburg  and Wright as to artistic form are not inconsistent with the  Puritan dogma, "God's altar needs no adornment."  Similarly, it seems to me, we must look to Puritan logic for  the roots of our modern belief in symbolism as the basis of art,  or as Mr. Frost says "just making metaphors." The Puritan felt  that the ratio was the reason of things, the respects and habitudes  of things, which they have among themselves, and the thing in  its true genus is the material subject of logic. Truth lay not in  the speech but in the things. It is not such a great jump from  seeing sermons in stones for Edwards to see in the world around  him shadows and images of divine things, or for Hawthorne to  see sin in a scarlet A. It is not even a great jump to the objective  correlative of Mr. T. S. Eliot. When Ezra Pound defined an  "Image" as "that which presents an intellectual and emotional  complex in an instant of time" he was consistent with Emerson,  who felt that things better than any image are expressed through  images, with Edwards' divine and supernatural light, and with  the Puritan's logic based upon immediate perception of God's  Truth in things.  Finally, I believe that it was Puritanism which gave the initial  impetus to that aspect of modern art which I call "naturalism"  with a small "n," not the slice of life school, but perhaps the  slice of God school. It is my prejudice that there are theories  of art which correspond to each of three logical positions. Appropriate to subjective Idealism is escapist art dealing primarily  with abstractions; appropriate to atomistic Individualism is hedonistic art; and appropriate to Transactionalism is naturalism  with a small "n." It does not, therefore, seem strange to me that  the art of aristocratic leisure classes should be either escapist  or hedonistic, and that the art of working middle classes should  be naturalistic. Coupling these prejudices with a prejudice that  Puritanism is the religion of the Middle Classes, I should expect  to find that our American art owed something to our Puritan  tradition, and I hope it is not solely due to my prejudices that  I seem to find corroboration for that view.  As I see the Puritan's problem it was what Professor Hopkins 	asu06600000140007001							62983536 Bytes	3704	5666	3890434992	RGB	8	600	asu06600000140007001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/646	646	647.jp2	/asu0660/image/647.jp2
Puritanism and Modern American Art					Ward, Robert S.																											asu0660000014	in his life of Winthrop called the dilemma of living in the world  of nature, enjoying all the good things God has provided for  man's enjoyment, but without sinning, thus avoiding both ascetic  escapism and hedonistic sensuousness.  Perry Miller opens his book The New England Mind with a  chapter on "The Augustinian Strain of Piety" in which he points  out the distinction between God's Providence (God's energy  put forth in governing the universe, in supporting the moral  order) and that stream of still more tremendous force, supernatural grace, receipt of which gives the regenerate another life  superior to the other forms. Calvin had asserted "as an undeniable truth that they who have been inwardly taught by the  Spirit, feel an entire acquiescence in the Scripture, and that it  is self-authenticated, carrying with it its own evidence, and ought  not to be made the subject of demonstration and arguments  from reason; but it obtains the credit which it deserves with us  by the testimony of the Spirit. For though it conciliate our reverence by its internal majesty, it never seriously affects us until  it is confirmed by the Spirit in our hearts . . ." He further describes the experience of Grace as "an intuitive perception of  God himself." It is this Grace which Professor Miller distinguishes  from the moralism of the Puritan: "The complete separation  between supernatural grace and all its natural simulacra . . .  the metaphysical distinction between God's decreeing will, as  seen in events, and his commanding will, as seen in the Bible."  It was his failure to note this distinction which led Mencken to  confuse Victorianism with Puritanism, just as Hemingway did  in The Sun Also Rises.  It seems clear that New England Puritans found in the practice of piety, the ecstatic vibrancy of regenerate life, the satisfactions that we find in the enjoyment of art. Their poetic productions do not appeal to us because, in them, they followed  the conventions of Renaissance art, the Sydney formula "to  please and to instruct." Sydney's injunction "Look into thine  heart and write" was followed by Anne Bradstreet only in  her unpublished private scribblings, not in her ponderous and  learned "Four Times Four."  So it is that Jonathan Edwards wrote what we should think  i 	asu06600000140008001							66153964 Bytes	3891	5664	3447510730	RGB	8	600	asu06600000140008001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/647	647	648.jp2	/asu0660/image/648.jp2
Puritanism and Modern American Art					Ward, Robert S.																											asu0660000014	of as aesthetic theory in his theological account of the reason  why God created the universe: "The disposition to communicate  himself or diffuse his own fulness; which we must conceive of  as being originally in God as a perfection of his nature, was  what moved him to create the world. It is a regard to himself  that disposes him to diffuse and communicate himself. It is such  a delight in his own internal fulness and glory, that disposes  him to an abundant effusion and emanation of that glory." The  "Divine and Supernatural Light" is fitly compared to "an effulgence or emanation of Light from a luminary, by which this  glory of God is abundantly represented in Scripture. Light is  the external expression, exhibition and manifestation of the  excellency of the luminary of the sun for instance; it is abundant,  extensive emanation and communication of the fulness of the  sun to innumerable beings that partake of it. It is by this that  the sun itself is seen, and his glory beheld, and all other things  are discovered; it is by a participation of this communication  from the sun, that surrounding objects receive all their lustre,  beauty and brightness. It is by this that all nature is freshened  and receives life, comfort and joy."  Certainly it is in the Personal Narrative of Edwards that the  lyrical rapture of the Puritan caught up by Grace finds its finest  expression.  It was not, however, until Emerson abandoned the pulpit for  the Lyceum Lectern that Puritanism consciously and overtly  sought to find in art what it had once found in saving Grace, or,  rather, sought to identify art with Grace. Abandoning what to  him had become the dead and empty forms of a once vital faith,  he freed his aesthetic theory from the moralism of his Puritan  ancestors, yet allied it to that mystical piety which was the base  of the old religion. As Carpenter says, Emerson's God, like the  deity of Jonathan Edwards, "became a kind of supreme artist  creating the world with a mystical appreciation of its beauty."  It was Unitarianism's insistence upon the finality of God's  revelation in the Scripture, as much as its substitution of moralism for pietism, that made Emerson reject it; in it God was in  the Past, not the Present tense.

Puritanism and Modern American Art					Ward, Robert S.																											asu0660000014	the latest accents of the Holy Ghost, as Emerson thought he  should, then it was to nature that he must go and with an acute  sensitivity seek out things, not for themselves, but for the significant revelations which they express, to see their significant forms.  He felt that nature offers all her creatures to the Poet as a picture-  language. Despising those poets who wrote from the fancy at a  safe distance from their own experience, he asserted that the  highest minds of the world have never ceased to explore the  quadruple or the centuple or much more manifold meaning, of  every sensuous fact. "For we are not pans and barrows, nor even  porters of the fire and torch-bearers, but children of the fire,  made of it . . ." To him "the fountains whence all this river of  time and its creatures floweth are intrinsically ideal and beautiful."  Nature, then, was the source of art, but for him nature was not  inert matter, something static to be imitated in representational  copies as it was to surface Realism or to Naturalism with a  Capital N. To him it was natura naturans, dynamically evolving  new forms, and like Edwards he knew that it was an interaction  or interpenetration of man with his larger self; man makes his  own objects, hence nature is intrinsically ideal and beautiful.  Art is not, therefore, escape from life, passive reflection, nor is  it mechanical reproduction of objects by imitation. It is active  experience, a reaching out into nature to search out the divine  in it and—having realized it—communicating it.  John Dewey is modern as can be when he writes: "The material out of which a work of art is composed belongs to the  common world rather than to the self, and yet there is self-expression in art because the self assimilates that material in a  distinctive way to reissue it into the public world in a form that  builds a new object."  But behind him I see Emerson and Thoreau walking in the  woods on the shore of Walden Pond, more dimly Jonathan  Edwards reading Locke and Newton at Yale, and—in the extreme shadows—John Cotton of Emmanuel College opening up  doctrine and uses in the plain style until his words become things  and one of the young Anglicans before him lifts up his hat from  over his eyes.  8 	asu06600000140010001							66350288 Bytes	3900	5669	571197442	RGB	8	600	asu06600000140010001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/649	649	650.jp2	/asu0660/image/650.jp2
Pope's "Alas! How Chang'd"					Wellington, James E.																											asu0660000014	Pope's "Alas! How Chang'd"  Some Variations on a Vergilian Theme  James E. Wellington  In the second book of Vergil's Aeneid, as the Trojans are  eating and drinking with their Carthaginian hosts at Dido's  banquet table, the queen begs Aeneas to relate the story  of the fall of Troy and the subsequent wanderings of him and  his men. This he does; and having given his account of Sinon's  treachery and the famous horse, he reaches the stage at which  the bloody fighting inside the city has just begun. During the  preliminary events (he goes on to say) he had been asleep and  in his dream beheld the ghost of Hector standing before him  and imploring him not to risk certain death in battle for a  doomed city but to make his escape and travel the reaches of  the earth in search of a new home for the Vesta and Penates  of Troy. Hector appeared as he had been at the moment of his  death, when Achilles with his "Thessalian coursers" had "dragged him o'er the plain"—filthy, mutilated, encrusted with blood  —far different (Aeneas continues) from the exultant Hector  who had worn in triumph the armor of Achilles and set the ships  of the Greeks ablaze with Phrygian fire:  Hei mihi, qualis erat! quantum mutatus ab illo  Hectore, qui redit exuvias indutus Achilli,  Vel Danaum Phrygios jaculatus puppibus ignis!  (Aeneid ii. 274-276)  The first English translation of the lines, that of Surrey, reads  somewhat inaccurately as follows:  Ay me, what one? [sic] that Hector how unlike,  Which erst returned clad with Achilles' spoils;  Or when he threw into the Greekish ships  The Trojan flame!  (Lines 293-296)  Dryden's version, a century and a half later, omits the grief-  stricken hei mihi (meaning something like "alas") and places  stronger emphasis on Hector's triumph and the terror of the  Greeks:  • 9 	asu06600000140011001							67024292 Bytes	3936	5673	851116439	RGB	8	600	asu06600000140011001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/650	650	651.jp2	/asu0660/image/651.jp2

(Lines 358-361)  The key phrase in Vergil's passage, quantum mutatus ab illo/  Hectore, is rendered by both Surrey and Dryden in almost identical language. But neither translation succeeds in capturing the  essential sadness and compassion of the original, the sense of  the tragedy of life which two thousand years of Vergil scholarship have consistently ranked among the poet's most appealing  attributes. It is clearly this which suggested the lines to Sir  Thomas Browne in his meditations, in Religio Medici, on the  physical corruption and decay of death. Browne dreads the  thought that death will one day reduce him to a staring corpse,  a horror to his friends and family, prey to the carrion birds and  beasts of the field. He would wish instead to vanish into the sea,  "to be swallowed up in the abyss of waters; wherein I had perished unseen, unpityed, without wondering eyes, tears of pity,  Lectures of mortality, and none had said, "Quantum mutatus  abillo!" (1,40).  It is just this transformation from life to death, from vitality  to decay, which Vergil's lines so poignantly dramatize in Hector;  such is the pity which Vergil and his readers share as they contemplate the desecrated vision of a noble human being and a  godlike hero. A comment by one of Vergil's eighteenth-century  editors, Christian Gottlob Heyne, stresses the contrast which the  lines imply between past and present fortune—fortunce pristince  et prcesentis comparatione1—and the point is beyond dispute.  But it is not only this bitter recollection of past happiness in  present sorrow (a commonplace of poetry) which has given  the passage its enduring fame. The ghost of Hector also evokes  a contrast between past glory and present humiliation, between  triumph and defeat, in which the overtones of tragedy are plainly  to be heard. Milton, in a characteristic blend of classic and  Hebraic, combines Vergil's phrase with a comparable passage  ^hr. Gottl. Heyne (ed.), P. Virgilii Maronis Opera (4 vols.; London:  T. Rickaby, 1793). II, 204.

Pope's "Alas! How Chang'd"					Wellington, James E.																											asu0660000014	from Isaiah (14:12) to achieve a similar epic quality. Milton's  Satan, expelled from Heaven, slowly rouses himself in the "darkness visible" of Hell and addresses his fallen cohort Beelzebub:  If thou beest he; But O how fall'n! how chang'd  From him, who in the happy Realms of Light  Cloth'd with transcendent brightness didst out-shine  Myriads though bright....  (Paradise Lost, I, 84-87)  It does not matter here that the defeat of the noble Hector has  been changed into the abasement of a fallen rebel against God.  The luminous glory which was Beelzebub's in Heaven is gone  forever, and its loss is nonetheless to be lamented. This sense  of loss Steele was to exploit for comic purposes fifty years later  in a parody of Milton's line inserted into Spectator No. 254.  Lydia, an Augustan coquette, begins a letter to her newly married friend Harriot in the accents of mock-epic lamentation: "If  thou art she, but oh, how fallen, how changed, what an Apostate!  How lost to all that's gay and agreeable!" The Vergilian and  Miltonic echo plainly asserts that Lydia herself will never (in  Millamant's phrase) "by degrees dwindle into a Wife" as Hector  has been degraded into a mutilated corpse or Beelzebub into a  denizen of Hell.  Vergil's phrase is used again to paint a picture of humiliation  in an anonymous Jacobite song denouncing Sir John Murray  (1718-1777) of Broughton, Peeblesshire, sometime secretary  to the Young Pretender and the Jacobite army, who turned king's  evidence against the Jacobites in order to save his own life:  "Once honest, steady, brave; / How great the change to traitor,  coward, knave!" (lines 11-12).2 The lines clearly suggest the  ignominy and disgrace into which Murray fell; and the epigraph  which introduces the entire poem—and, indeed, summarizes it  —is Vergil's phrase quantum mutatus ab illo.  That Alexander Pope should have availed himself of this  formula will come as no surprise in view of its obvious usefulness  to other men of letters and in view of Pope's own strong Vergilian propensities. Nor will those aware of the remarkable range  2"On Murray of Broughton," in Jacobite Minstrelsy (Glasgow: Richard  Griffin and Co., 1829), p. 294.  •  11 	asu06600000140013001							63782336 Bytes	3777	5627	245222346	RGB	8	600	asu06600000140013001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/652	652	653.jp2	/asu0660/image/653.jp2
Pope's "Alas! How Chang'd"					Wellington, James E.																											asu0660000014	and variety of Pope's allusiveness be surprised to find him using  the phrase in no fewer than four passages, all of which alter  the Vergilian echo in various ways to create different turns of  meaning and different emotional emphases. The earliest occurrence of the words in Pope is in Eloisa to Abelard (1717), lines  99-100. For some twenty-five lines past, Eloisa has been struggling to justify, through the doctrine of libertine naturalism, her  illicit relationship with Abelard while ruminating ecstatically  upon its joys. But all of these pleasures, like Hector's triumphs,  are in the past. Now, as she sits sobbing in the chill confines of  the Paraclete, Abelard's misdirected letter in her hand, she meditates bitterly, as Aeneas does, upon past joy in present sorrow:  Alas how chang'd! what sudden horrors rise!  A naked lover bound and bleeding lies!  Quantum mutatus! What is it that has changed for Eloisa, and  how does it differ from what has changed for Aeneas in the original Latin of Vergil's poem? For the Trojan, the most apparent  change is of course in Hector himself, and it is this which plus  Aeneas compassionately mentions first. But with the change in  Hector has come a terrible and irrevocable change in the fortunes  of the Trojans and their city. This public doom is implied through  the contrast between the victorious Hector of the early days of  the war and the vanquished, helpless Hector of the vision. Pope's  heroine, on the other hand, is concerned chiefly with the alteration of her own situation for the worse, her own descent from  happiness to woe. To Eloisa nothing else matters much. Only in  a secondary sense can the change be extended beyond her to  Abelard himself, bound and bleeding and changed indeed from  that Abelard who so capably gratified her physical desires in the  time of their former happiness. As in Vergil, then, the change in  circumstances has been brought about by that in a single individual; and the allusion provided Pope with an image whereby he  could guide his reader swiftly back from the situation itself to the  person whose alteration has brought it about. The grandeur of  Vergil's picture of total destruction Pope has intentionally and  very skillfully attenuated to the pathos of Eloisa's personal frustration. This he does by borrowing verbatim Vergil's description  of an epic catastrophe and using the words to describe one per-  • 12  __ 	asu06600000140014001							67230200 Bytes	3942	5683	4097153935	RGB	8	600	asu06600000140014001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/653	653	654.jp2	/asu0660/image/654.jp2

Pope's "Alas! How Chang'd"					Wellington, James E.																											asu0660000014	son's loss of a love which, by comparison, is self-centered and  trivial. Anyone who has seen the lurid engraving of the attack  upon Abelard which forms the frontispiece of Pope's source,  John Hughes's 1713 version of the Heloise-Abelard correspondence, can appreciate at once the contrast between the quantum  mutatus in Pope's Abelard and in Vergil's Hector. The honorable  wounds of battle, a fitting subject for an epic poem, are debased  into the humiliation of castration by a sneak attack. Hector fell  as an epic hero should, fighting for his city and his people. Even  Beelzebub, though now a fiend in Hell, was defeated as an angel  in honorable combat. But Abelard was wounded in his bed; and,  to make the matter worse, he is permanently enfeebled and degraded in consequence of his pursuit of what he himself confessed to be an ignoble seduction. Pope took what he required.  From the original heroic lines only the pathetic elements remain  —the quantum mutatus itself and the recollection of past happiness in present grief which is the essence of Eloisa's lament. The  rest, the defeat of the epic hero, has disappeared with the epic  context of Vergil's poem.  Three years later the formula appears again in a poem by  Pope, this time in an epic rather than a romantic context. In Book  xxii of the Iliad, a passage which Vergil probably had in mind,  Homer describes the very scene recalled by Aeneas's vision, the  death and desecration of Hector at the hands of the infuriated  Achilles. The Achaeans exult over the fallen hero and exclaim  with ironic glee, mingled with considerable relief, that "Hector  is easier to handle now than when he set the ships on fire" (xxii.  323).3 But in this cutting taunt, Pope thought, Homer was reflecting discredit upon his countrymen—Pope's note to the passage calls it "a mean insult"—and his own version of the lines  accords more closely with his view of the aristocratic ideal:  How chang'd that Hector! who like Jove of late,  Sent lightening on our fleets, and scatter'd fate?  (Lines 468-469)  There are two changes here. First, the unseemly sarcasm of  Homer's soldiers is replaced by a more dignified and reflective  3Homer, The Iliad, tr. E. V. Rieu (Baltimore: Penguin Books, 1950),  p. 407.

Pope's "Alas! How Chang'd"					Wellington, James E.																											asu0660000014	irony, which Pope introduces by imposing the Vergilian quantum  mutatus on the Homeric original. Second, although there is no  mention of the gods in Homer's line, Pope makes the Greeks  compare the earlier, triumphant Hector with Jove, thus at one  stroke giving them a quite unwarranted but thoroughly aristocratic appreciation of Hector's godlike qualities and intensifying  the contrast, implied in the quantum mutatus, between past glory  and present defeat. And this is not all. In Book xxiii of the Iliad  another ghost glides into the poem, the ghost of Patroclus, who  comes to Achilles demanding immediate burial for his mortal  remains; and Pope is again reminded of Vergil's lines. The moment that Achilles stretches out his arms to embrace his dead  comrade, the vision disappears, leaving Homer's hero to reflect  despondently that what survives of the dead in Hades is "only  the ghost and semblance of a man; for all night long the ghost  of poor Patroclus (and it looked exactly like him) has been  standing at my side, weeping and wailing, and telling me of all  the things I ought to do."4 Pope's version, however, reverts once  again to the quantum mutatus, though it is not in the original,  thus subduing the heart-broken immediacy of Achilles' outcry  in favor of the more generalized Vergilian pathos:  This night my friend, so late in battle lost,  Stood at my side, a pensive, plaintive ghost;  Ev'n now familiar, as in life, he came,  Alas! how diff'rent yet how like the same!  (Lines 126-129)  Pensive, plaintive, Alas! how diffrent!—the words are wholly  characteristic of Pope's style throughout the Homer, a style more  Vergilian than Homeric, more Roman than Greek. Augustan  readers, like most of their ancestors, were more conversant with  Latin than with Greek—Pope's own knowledge of Greek was  far surpassed by Shelley's—and the close kinship which he and  his contemporaries felt with the great Latin poets is shown by  the extent to which he felt obliged to Romanize Homer. The  double intrusion of a widely imitated Latin formula into an epic  originally Greek is characteristic not only of Pope but of the  esthetic predilections of the age in which he lived.  &lt;Ibid., pp. 414-415.  • 14 	asu06600000140020001							66232260 Bytes	3927	5620	829860138	RGB	8	600	asu06600000140020001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/659	659	660.jp2	/asu0660/image/660.jp2
Pope's "Alas! How Chang'd"					Wellington, James E.																											asu0660000014	More than a decade later Pope was to use the quantum mutatus once more, and for yet another purpose. The poem is the  didactic-satiric Epistle to Bathurst (1732/33); the context,  Pope's famous though highly colored account of the death of  George Villiers, second duke of Buckingham (1628-1687), the  notorious Restoration rake and the "Zimri" of Dryden's Absalom  and Achitophel—a poem which Pope is asking his readers to  recall just as surely as Vergil is asking his readers to remember  Homer. A major theme of Pope's epistle is charity—charity as  a Golden Mean between the two extremes of stinginess and  prodigality; and Villiers, one of the squanderers, is shown dying  in wretched poverty after having dissipated a fortune. In a  squalid tavern, on a ragged and filthy mattress, the emblems  of the Order of the Garter ironically hanging from the bedstead,  Great Villers lies—alas! how chang'd from him,  That life of pleasure, and that soul of whim!  (Lines 305-306)  Again the quantum mutatus serves to point the contrast between  past and present; but the difference is that the past is here marked  not by glory but by the most abject futility and folly. In the  scenes from Vergil and Homer, whichever translations we may  read, something precious and important has been destroyed—  a hero, a city, a beloved comrade in arms. In Buckingham's  death little of value has been lost. The happiness of the past  is here only a tissue of pointless and irrational debauchery, and  the sorrows of the present are accordingly debased into something dirty, ignoble, and faintly absurd. Even romantic love,  unheroic though it may be from the Homeric standpoint, is  cheapened here into frivolity and criminal self-indulgence as the  faithful Eloisa is replaced in the reader's mind (with the aid of  Pope's note) by a picture of the infamous countess of Shrewsbury holding Buckingham's horses while he murders her husband  in a duel. The mock-epic irony of "The George and Garter  dangling from the bed" (line 303), together with the ethico-  satiric context in which the Vergilian formula has been placed,  creates an air of derision and censure quite different from Pope's  other uses of the quantum mutatus—the grief of Eloisa and  Achilles or the muffled sarcasm of the Greeks over the body  of Hector.  • 15 	asu06600000140021001							63720288 Bytes	3776	5623	2286906951	RGB	8	600	asu06600000140021001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/660	660	661.jp2	/asu0660/image/661.jp2
Pope's "Alas! How Chang'd"					Wellington, James E.																											asu0660000014	In all this we can perceive a recurrent pattern. To pass from  the man whom Eloisa fancied "Some emanation of th'all-beau-  teous Mind" (E. to A., line 62) to the man who luxuriated in  "The bow'r of wanton Shrewsbury and love" (Ep. Bath., line  308)—glancing meanwhile at the sorrowing Achilles and the  relieved and admiring Greeks—is to cover a wide distance in  characterization and poetic viewpoint. Yet, the contrast between  past and present is implied in every instance, as in the original  passage from the Aeneid. Not only did Pope perceive this contrast but he was also aware of the varied interpretations and  adaptations which lay buried in Vergil's phrase; and the quantum  mutatus, under his shaping intelligence, meaningfully fulfills the  special requirements of each passage while simultaneously reminding the reader, if he knows his Vergil, of its genesis in  Aeneas's tragic vision. The end result is one more example of  Pope's extraordinary versatility in the use of allusion and of the  extent to which his poetic methods and attitudes were permeated  by Vergil and the heroic tradition as understood by the men of  the Augustan Age.  16 	asu06600000140022001							67000704 Bytes	3960	5638	3602921143	RGB	8	600	asu06600000140022001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/661	661	662.jp2	/asu0660/image/662.jp2
Edwin Muir's Poetry: A New Evolution Toward Permanent Value					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000014	Edwin Muir's Poetry: A New  Evolution Toward Permanent Value  Evelyn Thomas Helmick  Ti HE HISTORY of modern literature, Edwin Muir says,  describes the disappearance of man as religion and  humanism conceived him. Instead a new species of  man has emerged who is only part of "a biological sequence and  a social structure." At one time, before he became a poet,  Muir's interest was in this new species, especially in relation to  the social structure. After his family moved from Orkney to  industrial Glasgow, he became an ardent socialist. Throughout  his life his literary criticism shows him concerned with political  man; when he was chosen to give the W. P. Ker lecture for  1946 at the University of Glasgow, his subject was "The Politics  of King Lear." But his essays do not express a socialist view of  literature's responsibility to society; their tenor might be summed  up in his statement that we lose, in the political interpretation  of literature, the "conviction that a mind can speak to a mind,  immediately." The lecture on King Lear is more profound than  most criticism from a political point of view. Shakespeare, Muir  says, wrote in that play the "mythical drama of the transmutation of civilization." Although this is a kind of political interpretation, it is far from being only that. Muir's outlook had  been changed from his early Glasgow days by his marriage, a  move to London in 1919, and psychoanalysis shortly afterwards.  His own poetry, which he began to write at thirty-five, is  an attempt to rediscover for twentieth century man the religious  and humanistic conception that he found lacking in other  modern poets. His method is threefold: he maintains an individuality in poetic composition in the midst of modern poetic  movements; he makes extensive use of Greek and Christian  mythology; and he manipulates time in such a way that critics  often speak of him as a "metaphysical" poet.  The problem of individuality is central to his thinking. He  wrote his autobiography, for example, in an attempt to "find  out what a human being is in this extraordinary age which  • 17 	asu06600000140023001							64399140 Bytes	3800	5647	2163053967	RGB	8	600	asu06600000140023001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/662	662	663.jp2	/asu0660/image/663.jp2
Edwin Muir's Poetry: A New Evolution Toward Permanent Value					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000014	depersonalizes everything." In 1938, traveling through Europe,  he wrote that the important thing was to see himself as well  as the world about him. His relation to others took many directions, he said—"inward, outward, into dreams, into social  observation, into the past by a single line, over the present by  countless lines." He tries in all these rational and irrational  ways to know himself, and then can only ask that a grace  Come of itself to wrap our souls in peace  Between the turning leaves of history and make  Ourselves ourselves . . .  ("The Wheel")  He searches for distinctiveness in poetic style as well as in his  life. Because he is not representative of modern British poets,  many critics have ignored him. When he is mentioned at all,  however, it is always as a poet set apart. Douglas Bush, for  example, calls him a "rather timeless and individual voice."  J. C. Hall quotes the opinion of G. S. Fraser that Muir was  (in 1956) "one of the two best living writers of plain prose,"  and analyzes his style as "unaffected and unadorned," flexible,  and as individual as the rhythm of his poetry. Because it is  the expression of one man's thought and personality, Hall  thinks that the prose is what emphasizes the integrity of Muir's  work as a whole. Perhaps his distinctive qualities are due to the  heritage of his independent Norse ancestors, to his childhood in  rural Scotland, or to the release of his frustrations during his  psychoanalysis, as Hall suggests. Whatever the cause, the result  is a poetry that arises from a unique human experience.  Yet, paradoxically enough, the vehicle chosen for the expression of that experience is, more often than not, one of the  age-old myths. At the beginning of his writing career, Muir  reworked Scottish ballads to tell the story of "Hector in Hades";  he wrote the narrative of Moses' prophecy; described life in  terms of the labyrinth at Cnossos; devoted his final book of  poetry (One Foot in Eden) almost exclusively to the great myths  of Western civilization. What he said of Holderlin is equally  true of himself:  In his poetry he treated the gods and human life in much  the same way as Plato treated them in the poetic fables  which he introduced in Phaedrus and The Banquet.

Edwin Muir's Poetry: A New Evolution Toward Permanent Value					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000014	fables were imaginative interpretations of mysteries which  could not be elucidated by philosophical argument. Holder-  lin's prophetic poetry is of the same kind. He approached  the mystery of time and eternity through the imagination.  He attacked it directly; the mystery itself, not any particular manifestation of it, was his theme; and what he  made out of it was a mythology.1  Muir was not certain whether such poetry arose from the ancestral dream material described by Jung or the "delusive desires  of mankind in all ages." But his last unfinished poem begins,  I have been taught by dreams and fantasies  Learned from the friendly and the darker phantoms  And got great knowledge and courtesy from the dead  Kinsmen and kinswomen, ancestors and friends . . .  ("I Have Been Taught")  Most recent poets have perhaps agreed with Schlegel that a  weakness of modern poetry derives from its lacking a center  such as mythology was for the Greek and Roman poets. But  few have used myth in the religious way that Muir uses it.  Almost all of his poetry has some narrative quality, usually  based on the more familiar of the myths. George Santayana has  said that the value of Christianity lies in its presentation of a  story, rather than a cosmology; this is no less true of Greek  mythology. And Muir recognizes the religious value of story in  both Christian and Greek myths. Probably the single word  repeated most often in his poems is fable. He uses it in its earliest  meaning, as legend or myth, and always with spiritual significance. The adjective storyless, on the other hand, he uses to  show the emptiness of modern life. Of the ignorant characters  in "The Other Oedipus," he says,  They were quite storyless and had clean forgotten  That memory burning in another world;  But they were too leaf-light now for any story.  If anyone spoke a word of other guilt  By chance before them, then they stamped their feet  In rage and gnashed their teeth like peevish children.  But then forgot.  The problem of the story is uppermost in "Prometheus" as well:  Who will give answer to the earth's dark story? . . .  1 "Holderlin's Patmos," in Essays on Literature and Society (London,  1949), p. 102.  • 19 	asu06600000140025001							63713036 Bytes	3758	5648	3745930043	RGB	8	600	asu06600000140025001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/664	664	665.jp2	/asu0660/image/665.jp2
Edwin Muir's Poetry: A New Evolution Toward Permanent Value					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000014	The shrines are emptying and the peoples changing.  It may be I should find Olympus vacant  If I should return. For I have heard a wonder:  Lands without gods; nothing but earth and water;  Words without mystery; . . .  At the world's end to whom shall I tell the story?  Obviously, story, fable, and word all have religious connotations for Muir. The artist's view of man, he insists, must be  the religious view. Admitting that in its early stages the decay  of religion encourages production of imaginative literature, he  adds:  . . . but the complete decay of the religious sense would  bring with it the atrophy of the creative imagination, which  needs as a working hypothesis something more durable  than the immediate subject-matter on which it works.2  It is inconceivable to him that belief could fail completely, for  religion, especially belief in eternity, he says, is natural to man.  The task of the poet, in his view, is to restore the religious view,  which includes the concepts of individuality and immortality.  Even more specifically, he wrote that although he could not  believe in any one creed, all his poetry sprang from his belief  in immortality in one way or another.  The dark Enchanter is your friend.  Is it fantasy or faith  That keeps intact that marvelous show  And saves the helpless dead from harm?—  Tomorrow sounds the great alarm  That puts the histories to rout;  Tomorrow and tomorrow brings  Endless beginning without end. . . .  And you shall weep for grief and joy  To see the whole world perishing  Into everlasting spring . . .  ("Into Thirty Centuries Born")  The ancient myths, with their central theme of rebirth and  resurrection, provided Muir with a basis for his statement of  belief in immortality.  Although Muir's poetry is rooted in a faith in eternity, he is  obviously preoccupied with the effects of time on human life.  2 "The Decline of the Novel," in Essays, pp. 149-150.  • 20 	asu06600000140026001							66365948 Bytes	3912	5653	2865279977	RGB	8	600	asu06600000140026001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/665	665	666.jp2	/asu0660/image/666.jp2
Edwin Muir's Poetry: A New Evolution Toward Permanent Value					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000014	Even his criticism of the modern novel emphasizes the author's  use of time. The form is declining, Muir says, because the contemporary novel is a "story of time against a background of  time"; the traditional novel is a "story of time against a permanent pattern." And so contemporary literature is shallow and  fragmented because "without this permanent background there  can be no whole picture of life." Significant literature, in contrast, presents a relation between man and some unchangeable  order. He chooses Kafka as the greatest of modern novelists  for the very ability to express this relationship:  He has provided imaginative writers not merely with a way  of looking at life, but with a way of dealing with life. In  an age obsessed by the time sense, or, as it is called, the  historical sense, he has resurrected and made available for  contemporary use the timeless story, the archetypal story,  in which is the source of all stories.3  Anyone concerned exclusively with the present is certain to  be shallow, Muir thought. In his lecture on King Lear, for  example, he says that Regan, Goneril, and Cornwall never feel  that they have done wrong, because they represent a new idea,  and "new ideas, like everything new, bring with them their own  kind of innocence." The problem in King Lear, he continues,  is like that faced by contemporary society: "Tradition, filled  with memory, has been smashed by an individualism that exists  in its perpetual present."  It is Muir's poetry, however, that makes the most interesting  comment on time. Choosing a passage is difficult, because the  relation of the present to the past, to the future, to eternity  underlies almost all of his poems, even when the time theme is  not explicit. But "Variations on a Time Theme" provides some  definitions:  Time is a sea. There, if I could but sail  For ever and outface Death's bullying gale  I'd ask no more,  and,  Time's a fire-wheel whose spokes the seasons turn,  And fastened there we, Time's show martyrs, burn.  or, more gently,  Time's armies are the seconds soft as rain,  3"Franz Kafka," in Essays, p. 124.  • 21 	asu06600000140027001							64350964 Bytes	3801	5640	953698938	RGB	8	600	asu06600000140027001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/666	666	667.jp2	/asu0660/image/667.jp2
Edwin Muir's Poetry: A New Evolution Toward Permanent Value					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000014	Whose wound's so fine it leaves no scar nor stain. . . .  Nevertheless,  Imprisonment's for ever; we're the mock of Time,  While lost and empty lies Eternity.  In "Three Tales" he provides a philosophical discussion of the  problem of time:  There are three tales of time. The first one says  The traveller in the mind created it  That there might be a theme, a great flawed story  To interrupt the unbearable trance of peace,  And for that gain time was a trifling fee.  The second holds that time was there already  Before we came, and that our opening eyes  Struck full upon it. This, they say, is why  We know the changing world, for all was there  In that first look, with no division.  The rest was Afterwards. The third tale says  That we were born into eternity,  The boundless garden, and our issuing thence  Was self-incarceration in a prison  Where we act out our wishes' wild succession.  Like story and fable, the word time appears on nearly every  page. Yet Muir varies these themes and keeps them consistently  vital.  They are, after all, the basic themes of man's existence: individual identity, immortality, the passage of time. And poets of  all ages have dealt with them, writing either in the fashion of  their age or in an individual way. In his handling of these themes,  Muir often resembles Keats—in his use of myth, in his Platonic  conception of the world, in the serenity which seems to underly  his work, and perhaps most of all in that "honesty" which Walter  Jackson Bate says describes Keats' work. Perhaps his concern  with permanent values, his refusal to accept the modern "reduction of the image of man, who has become simpler, more  temporal, more realistic, and more insignificant," has lent this  quality of honesty to his work.  His reputation has been small to date, but sympathetic reception of his Collected Poems (1960) suggests that his work  will be more highly valued in the future. Recent criticism is  inclined to an increasingly favorable view of those poets who  with quiet integrity help the reader to  Seek the beginnings, learn from whence you come  And know the various earth from which you are made.

Publieado por or den del  esemo. Guadalupe Victoria, primer  presidente de la Republica Mexi-  cana. (Mexico, 1825). Purchased  on the Library Memorial Fund, the  gift of several persons.  Cuba. Album Pintoresco de la  Isla de Cuba. May & Co., [1853?].  Composed of twenty-seven delicately colored lithographs, this Album presents a series of engravings  which are classical examples of fine  craftmanship of the nineteenth century. These engravings, the work  of the French landscape painter  Federico Mialhe, acquired wide  recognition and permitted the men  of his time to receive an accurate  and indelible impression of mid-  nineteenth century Cuba as seen  through the eyes of a European.  Hence in addition to their high artistic quality the lithographs have  an unusual documentary value.  They have long been an important  source for the study of the architecture, the customs, and the Cuban  people of that period. The Album,  with considerable changes, was  published in black and white, possibly in the same year, and our  Library has also a copy of that  issue.  This colored copy was purchased  with funds given in memory of the  late Mrs. Lon Worth Crow.  El Caiman Barbuda (Habana, 1-,  1966-) is a new tabloid of which  the Library has so far purchased  the first six numbers. The preface  indicates that "we will sponsor the  investigation in all fields of knowledge, but we will not forget that  we are men of a time, . . . men  from the Socialist Cuban Revolution, and we are in debt to it ...

Walt Whitman					Balseiro, José Agustín, 1900-1991																											asu0660000013	THE  CARRE LL  Volume 7 June, 1966 Number 1  Walt Whitman  Jose A. Balseiro  En 1855 Emerson tenia cincuenta y dos anos. Ya se le  aceptaba y admiraba como a la primera figura intelectual  de Norte America. Y, aiin mas, quien habia dicho que  los "hombres de caracter son la conciencia de la sociedad a la  que pertenecen", era alii universalmente reconocido como modelo  del vir bonus. Y este hombre bueno recibe entonces un librito  titulado Leaves of Grass. A las dos semanas y media de su publication, Emerson escribe una carta, firmada en Concord, Massachusetts, el 21 de julio. Se ha dicho de ella que es la carta mas  importante de la literatura de Estados Unidos. Va dirigida a  Whitman, en gratitud por "el maravilloso regalo" de Hojas de  hierba. Para Emerson tratase de "la mas extraordinaria pieza de  ingenio y de sabiduria que America ha creado hasta el momento".  Piensa que hay en ella "cosas incomparables dichas incompara-  blemente bien, como deben decirse". Se expresa jubiloso ante  el libre y bravo pensamiento del poeta. Y lo saluda al comienzo  de una gran carrera; / greet you at the beginning of a great career,  which yet must have had a long foreground, for such a start.  Las mentes estrechas contagiaronse de espanto. Hubo aspa-  vientos y hubo protestas. Todo podria reducirse a una interrogation: ^Como Emerson, la flor del Puritanismo, condonaba  un libro que a los pacatos pareciales inmoral y a los criticos sin  vista—no solo en Estados Unidos, sino tambien en Inglaterra —  pareciales de pesimo gusto?*  *Entre los comentarios afirmativos de autores ingleses, regocija anotar  el que, en 1887, hizo Robert Louis Stevenson: "A book of singular service  . . . But it is only a book for those who have the gift of reading." 	asu06600000130003001							62838708 Bytes	3766	5560	2851783404	RGB	8	600	asu06600000130003001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/675	675	676.jp2	/asu0660/image/676.jp2
Walt Whitman					Balseiro, José Agustín, 1900-1991																											asu0660000013	Ante ese planteamiento cabria preguntar si los protestantes  habian leido bien, y de verdad, a Emerson. Porque, catorce  aiios atras, en su ensayo "Heroism", de 1841, Emerson escribio  que cuando alguien se resuelve a ser grande, ha de atenerse a si  mismo: sin tratar, por debil, de reconciliarse con el mundo.  Sustentaba la idea de que el ser humano debe honrar sus propias  actiones, y felicitarse si ha hecho algo extrafio y extravagante  que rompa la monotonia de una edad decorosa.  Ahi hallariamos, acaso, la clave de su conducta porvenir a  proposito del libro de Whitman. Pero puede irse mas lejos; y  por otra direction. Emerson pensaba que inicialmente se tiene  el instinto, despues la opinion y, por ultimo, el conocimiento:  como la planta tiene raiz, yema y fruto. Todavia antes, en 1837,  aseguraba que la primera en tiempo y la primera en importancia  de las influencias sobre la mente humana es la de la Naturaleza.  En el invierno de 1838-39 Emerson pronuncio una serie de  conferencias en Boston. Su tema general era "La vida humana"  (Human Life). La cuarta de aquellas disertaciones titulabase  "Amor" (Love). Y paso—en forma y contenido casi identicos —  a su coleccion de ensayos. ^Que edad contaba Whitman enton-  ces? Nacido el 31 de mayo de 1819, andaba por los veinte  afios. Y sus Hojas de hierba no aparecerian hasta sus treinta y  seis. Whitman tiene en su libro un poema llamado "Cancion de  mi mismo" (Song of Myself) en que afirma:  Yo he dicho que el alma no es mas que el cuerpo,  Y he dicho que el cuerpo no es mas que el alma  (7 have said that the soul is not more than the body,  And I have said that the body is not more than the soul)  Comparese tal decir de Whitman con el Emerson sugeridor  de que el termino de toda ensefianza liberal debe ser el amor a  la belleza: el Emerson que reconoce el armonico e inseparable  consorcio entre el cuerpo y el alma, cuando escribia: The soul  is wholly embodied, and the body is wholly ensouled. Y se hallara  en el de la Nueva Inglaterra al precursor de un concepto vital  aclamado por el poeta del Estado de New York. No olvidemos  que, como seiiala Henry Seidel Canby, el individualismo re-  ligioso y moral de Emerson fue una de las influencias rectoras  en el pensamiento de Whitman. Y recuerdese que Whitman  mismo reconocio temprano que se consumia a fuego lento cuando 	asu06600000130004001							62801276 Bytes	3752	5576	1218603950	RGB	8	600	asu06600000130004001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/676	676	677.jp2	/asu0660/image/677.jp2
Walt Whitman					Balseiro, José Agustín, 1900-1991																											asu0660000013	Emerson lo hizo hervir: / simmered, simmered, Emerson brought  me to a boil.  Ahora, miremos el hecho desde otro angulo. El 14 de julio  de 1838 Emerson leyo una conferencia sobre fitica literaria  (Literary Ethics) en Dartmouth College. Quejabase, en aquella  ocasion, de que el rasgo tipico en la pintura, en la escultura, en  la poesia, en la novela, en la elocuencia de Estados Unidos,  parecia ser cierta gracia sin grandeza, y que, en si mismo, no  era nuevo, sino derivado.  Quien asi pensaba, £como no habria de regocijarse magnifi-  camente al impacto de una obra tan originalmente americana  como la de Whitman: nueva en su esencia vital, nueva en su  libertad, nueva en su emocion, nueva en el panorama que abar-  caba; pero, al mismo tiempo, con el ancho aliento y con la  sincera intensidad de los textos biblicos tan familiares al ex-  ministro religioso como al poeta que profetizaba el porvenir de  la nation?  *      *      *  Pese a tales afinidades, ique hondas diferencias pueden se-  nalarse entre uno y otro!  Emerson nace en una gran ciudad. Y ama el retiro. Whitman  ve la luz en el campo. Y se intoxica con la vida abundante,  repleta y varia de las calles de Manhattan: de sus teatros, de  sus cantinas, de sus hoteles. Pero sin renunciar a la pristina salud  de la Naturaleza. El culto a la forma clasica—de frase equili-  brada, contenida y armonica—es evidente en Emerson. Percibese  en el la preocupacion artistica. Whitman es el torrente poderoso  donde no cuenta el lugar de cada gota de agua, sino el impetu  de su energia creadora. Emerson ama toda causa noble favorable  a la libertad, al reconocimiento de los principios eticos y al  mejoramiento intelectual de su pueblo. Pero es un aristocrata en  el sentido expresado en su propio Diario (Journal) en agosto  de 1855: "la distincion del pensamiento es distincion aristo-  cratica". Whitman, sin ser menos personal, siente a la humanidad  en masa; y representa, enteramente, la encarnacion democratica:  One's-self I sing, a single separate person,  Yet utter the word Democratic, the word En-Masse.

Sin embargo, tal como explica el primero, en su  libro sobre las caracteristicas inglesas (English Traits), no era  buen viajero: / am not a good traveler. Pensaba que, bajo las  mas propicias condiciones, viajar es de las pruebas mas severas  a que puede someterse el hombre: But, under the best conditions,  a voyage is one of the severest tests to try a man. Whitman, en  cambio, nacio con la alegria del camino. Hombre que no siempre  tuvo un oficio o profesion regular—maestro de escuela, impresor,  periodista, empleado del gobierno, enfermero, poeta—conocio  temprano el gozo del alma errante en contacto con la grandeza  y la simplicidad de la Naturaleza y con la intensa complejidad  de las ciudades, desde Brooklyn a Nueva Orleans. Temperamen-  talmente, su sentido vagabundo diriase hermano del de Johannes  Brahms.  Mientras mejor se conoce a Estados Unidos, mas hondo se  cala en su poeta. Ante la grandeza de este pueblo—francas todas  sus pistas a la facilidad de cruzarlas—se siente la invitation a  la marcha larga: al movimiento progresivo, levadura de la musa  de Walt Whitman que se decretaba a si misma la superacion de  limites geograficos. Porque sabiendo que su paso podia ser de  gigante—sobre la tierra y bajo el firmamento de plurales Estados  hermanados por un solo pabellon—Whitman senoreaba en sus  cuatro puntos cardinales. Y sentia a su America en su canto.  Porque el este y el poniente eran suyos; porque eran suyos el  norte y el sur:  The east and the west are mine, and the north and the south  are mine.  Y queria conocer al universe mismo como si fuera un camino,  como si fuera muchos caminos, como caminos para las almas  viajeras.  La sugestion del vagar de un lado a otro de esta "atletica  Democracia" es imponente en los poemas de Whitman. Llama  para companero de su ruta a quien le oiga. Porque vagando a  su lado se encuentra lo que jamas fatiga:  A lions! whoever you are come travel with me!  Travelling with me you find what never tires.  Y aunque sabia que para quien inicia la Jornada la tierra ha  de ser dura, hermetica e incomprensible, como la Naturaleza  misma, animaba a no decaer; incitaba a mantener el ritmo re- 	asu06600000130006001							62552104 Bytes	3728	5591	3998553342	RGB	8	600	asu06600000130006001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/678	678	679.jp2	/asu0660/image/679.jp2

Porque sabia de la existencia de aquellas divinas  cosas mas bellas de lo que las palabras pudieran decir.  La simpatia espiritual de Whitman era vigorosa, elastica y  magnanima como su verso. Cantaba a la nation. Y era como  si la nation misma se diera al mundo con nuevo repertorio de  ideas, de sensaciones, de palabras nunca oidas. El poeta vivia  consciente de que su pueblo es hijo de muchos pueblos; de que  esta constituido por muchos pueblos. Y se entendia, pronto y  bien, con extranos y extranjeros:  What is it I interchange so suddenly with strangers?  Su lengua no fue nunca momificada y estreeha. Tenia la fle-  xibilidad de los rios esplendidos y la amplitud de las praderas  casi infinitas de sus Estados. Que cuando el panorama se ensan-  cha y crece con sana alegria, la voz no puede menos que ani-  marse y ser intrepida. Y Whitman nutria la suya de palabras  espanolas, italianas, francesas: como se nutrio su pueblo de la  sangre de esas tierras. Y asi lo hallamos escribiendo "ameri-  canos", "camaradas", "libertad"; "dolce", "affettuoso", "bravura"; "allons", "amours", "melange".  Sus alas eran demasiado pujantes, demasiado audaz su vuelo  para recogerse en el ensayo de horizontes minimos. Su fuerza  provenia de la vision universal no restringida: de la energia  original de todo su pueblo. Y sabia que su lengua y que cada  gota de su sangre estaban formadas de la tierra y del aire de  todos y cada uno de los Estados incluidos en su amor fundamental por ellos. Su poema "Starting From Paumanok" es apasionado  espejo donde se reflejan, vibrantes, todas las zonas de este trozo  palpitante del Nuevo Mundo. Y con la vision del futuro—sin  miedo nunca a romper moldes tradicionales—Whitman no solo  amaba como a vecino a cada hombre y a cada mujer de la Nueva  Inglaterra, del Mediano Oeste, del sur y del norte territorial y  constitucionalmente unidos. Queria salir en busca de play as y  paises remotos, para anexarlos simbolica y fraternalmente a las  orillas primeras de la nation. Porque pensaba—y esto no se ha  observado ni frecuente ni significativamente—que la tierra entera  y que todas las estrellas celestes existen para el amor religioso.  E insistia en que la real y permanente grandeza de los Estados  Unidos habria de ser la religiosa: 	asu06600000130007001							63460360 Bytes	3793	5575	1610403463	RGB	8	600	asu06600000130007001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/679	679	680.jp2	/asu0660/image/680.jp2

I say that the real and permanent grandeur of these States  must be their religion.  De otra manera no concebia esa grandeza. Porque ni el caracter  ni la vida valen la pena sin la religion, ni la tierra, ni la mujer,  ni el hombre:  Otherwise there is no real and permanent grandeur;  (Nor character nor life worthy the name without religion,  Nor land nor man or woman without religion).  Whitman intuyo que el destino superior de su pueblo habria  de ser unir, como no se unieron nunca antes, a seres de cultura  y de origen diversos: salvandoles el reeuerdo de donde venian,  y avivandoles la esperanza de juntarse como uno solo para la  obra por venir.  Quien creia que todas las hazanas heroicas habian sido con-  cebidas al aire libre; quien veia la tierra expandiendose a uno  y otro extremo de sus abiertos brazos, nacio, esencialmente, para  ser el poeta de Estados Unidos. Porque esta nation hace no-  madas. Y los nomadas han ido haciendo a la nation: fortalecien-  dola, prolongandola, ensanchandola. Dandole — con osadia y  ambition y ensueilo—nuevo aliento y horizontes nuevos: hasta  hacer de su brio juvenil el apoyo de los demas hombres:  For we cannot tarry here,  We must march, my darlings, we must bear the  brunt of danger,  We the youthful sinewy races, all the rest on us depend,  Pioneers! O Pioneers!  Era, la Uamada de Whitman, verbo de fe resplandeciente:  henchido de action. Para ir mas alia: siempre mas lejos. Y—  otra vez la actitud nueva—queria que el hombre y la mujer  compartieran vigilia y conquista: lanzados, de la mano, al azar  de la epica mudanza.  Este profeta—que hablaba del sexo en sus poemas con des-  nuda franqueza e inocente promiscuidad—sabia que nada es tan  grande como la madre de los hombres. Y pensaba en la mujer  con primitivo candor; con naturalidad de alma virgen.  Porque sabia que todas las grandes naturalezas aman la esta-  bilidad, Emerson no temia a la muerte.

Hombre de tierras frias y de inviernos largos,  comparaba el temor de la muerte con el de un corto estio. Pero  —aclaraba en su Diario {Journal, julio, 1855)—que cuando ya  hemos gozado del asueto, y nos hemos colmado de frutas y ca-  lentado uno y otro dia al sol, ansiamos descansar el pensamiento  y el deseo. Whitman, igualmente, porque era como un soplo  imperecedero, no parece nunca temeroso de la muerte. Al con-  trario. Deja que se le acerque deslizandose con dulce, materna  y esperanzadora familiaridad:  Dark mother, always gliding near with soft feet,  Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome?  Como si la sabiduria de su propio espiritu le adelantara el secreto  del sueno de paz. Y promete que nada puede ocurrirnos tan bello  como el morir. Y pregunta que es, finalmente, hermoso sino el  amor y la muerte. Y cuando evoca la vejez, la ve fluir sin trabas  hacia la deliciosa cercania liberadora:  Old age, flowing free with the delicious near-by  freedom of death.  Ahi vemos, otra vez, la compenetracion del ensayista y del  poeta con su pueblo que, ante la resta inevitable de la muerte,  en vez de extravertirse en desgarrado lamento—como el antiguo  de Israel que, probablemente, lo comunico a tantos mas—se  recoge en la resignation austera del duelo sin voces y del senti-  miento que se hace evocation, pero no protesta.  Cuando se cruza, y se vuelve a pasar por el Misisipi y el valle  de Ohio; cuando, al bajar desde Idaho, le sale al paso viajero la  maravilla del Bear Lake; al contemplar esas rocas majestuosas  como catedrales ultraterrenas bajo el cielo de Utah; cuando  Kansas entrega su corazon caliente de feraces llanos y California  imanta con sus desiertos, sus cordilleras y sus playas; cuando  las cuevas de Arkansas revelan refugios de aventureros; cuando  Nueva York y Brooklyn se enlazan con manos de acero; cuando  la tierra plana de la Luisiana conduce hacia la ciudad franco-  espanola a donde fue el poeta en una de sus andanzas infati-  gables, se siente—y se reconoce—que ninguno comprendio a su  pueblo como Whitman. Y por eso le canto como ninguno. Y  por eso le amo como el corazon del padre donde caben, juntos  y unanimes, sus hijos.  • 7 	asu06600000130009001							63719024 Bytes	3816	5564	1250703017	RGB	8	600	asu06600000130009001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/681	681	682.jp2	/asu0660/image/682.jp2
The Journal of Aaron Thomas																																asu0660000013	The Journal of Aaron Thomas  ON 1 JULY 1798, Aaron Thomas (b. Wigmore, Herefordshire), then 35 years of age and (apparently) an  officer of HMS Lapwing stationed in St. Kitts, West  Indies, began the second volume of a journal, the first volume  of which (450 pp.) he had commenced in Naples in November  of 1797. The Library acquired the journal (the second volume  only) from the California rare book dealer William Wreden,  who had discovered it in Ireland. As a document giving the flavor  of the time and place and providing colorful and amusing incidents enough to stock the most sprawling historical romance,  it is an invaluable source for either the student of West Indian  history or the hopeful emulator of Forester and Michael Scott.  The journal is interestingly varied, offering in addition to  normal diary materials, moral and informational essays, poems,  drawings, miniature dramas, and letters to and from the diarist.  Even superficial reading reveals that Thomas was a person of  some complexity, by turns ingenuous and sly, generous and  avaricious, self-assured and uncertain. Though he describes himself as "doomed to remain at Sea until the Olive Branch arrives,  and perhaps to[o] in this Stove of a Country," Thomas never  repines but conducts himself positively as an eager observer of  life aboard ship and ashore.  On Thursday, 10 October 1798, for example, he writes:  Dined in the Caben. had Pease Soup, as hot with Kian as  a Devil. A Capon boiled, by its taste I judge the body before it was put into the pott had been used to Swab the  Decks with, a pair of Ducks roasted, with a part of their  feathers on. A neat Tongue quit raw, having been only  diped in warm water, since it came out of the pickle Tub.

I shall turn you out of the  caben  As an essayist, Thomas displays a pleasant sense of irony. In  his "Paper No. 2, Being a few remarks on Sailors who wear  their hair Tyed," he observes that "A Sailor who wears his hair  Tyed, appears to me, to be a very accomodating man, The Que  which falls from his head down his back, being well adapted  to answer the purpose of a Bridge, over which large bodys of  Lice may decamp from Head Quarters, when the Napper is over  stocked, and spread themselves in more commodious pasturage  about the Jacket Shirt & fork of the Trousers."  Thus the "Que" assists the lice at the expense of the sailor. But  a long head of hair may also assist the sailor at the expense of  the lice:  There is a Sailor aboard our ship, who Eats a fat Hen  every month. He has a thick long head of hair, and the  Lice breed so fast in it, that he scrap [e]s a Tea Cup full  out every day, which the Hen eats with such avidity &  relish, that she is fltt for the pot, in nine days after eating  this food.  Such quantities of lice imply holds seething with rats. And  on Thomas's ship, rats meant sport.  So plentiful are Ratts in the Ship, that every night I see  the Boys are Seting on the Combings of the Twix't Decks  Main Hatchway, a fishing for Ratt; with the same phil-  osiphy as I see an Angler angling on the banks of a River.  — The Boys have a line with a Bait, and some Oakum  twirled about the Bait, which when the Ratt gets in his  • 10 	asu06600000130012001							63302540 Bytes	3782	5576	1890023747	RGB	8	600	asu06600000130012001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/684	684	685.jp2	/asu0660/image/685.jp2

Thomas and his shipmates found time between nit-picking,  rat-fishing, chases, floggings, drunken bouts, and other quotidian  shipboard activities to indulge the desire for such of the higher  things of life as poetry. On 28 July 1799 Thomas "Sent the old  She Goat ashore, with the following label round her Neck."  Whosoever does me find,  I beg that you will use me kind:  The cause of my being turn'd ashore  Was; that I had not Milke no more  And Corn being dear, since the War with france  I'm turn'd ashore; to take my chance  The Sea with me, did not agree  I'm scarse of flesh, as you now see  My flesh got dry.

For the historian as opposed to the belle-lettrist, Thomas's  story of the conquest of Surinam, involving a running account  of the fleet's voyage from the Indies and its difficulties in negotiating the Surinam River, will no doubt prove of greatest interest. Following are excerpts from a long letter which he wrote  his mother, after the campaign, from "Vanneau at Paramaribo  on the Banks of the River Surinam South America 28 Augt  1799":  I send this Letter by the Kings Ship, which goes to England with the account of the conquest of this Settlement, and  the taking of it from the Dutch, and a very valuable Capture it is.

This Country is very hot, so much so; that if [I] expose  my face to the Sun for half an hour, it will so burn my  skin; that it is impossible to suffer the operation of Shaving.  Yet the Soil is as rich, as the very best in Herefordshire,  for Cattle are so plentifull, that they run wild in the woods,  and they are often killed for the sake of their Hides. They  leave the Carcase to rot, and take the Hide away; which  they dry, and then fill them with Cotton, Coffee, Drugs,  and many other things.

The town of Paramaribo contains 80-000 Inhabitants half of which are Indians & Blacks.  All the Streets have two Rows of orange Trees in them.  I counted 144 Orange Trees in one Street, & each Tree  had at least 300 Oranges on it.  So rich are some of the Inhabitants, that a few of them  will go to the expence of gilding with Gold a small part  of the Trunks of the orange Trees, which are before their  doors.

I saw one  of these Red Indian Weomen, who had a parcel of Pins  run through her lower Lip: the heads of the Pins were  in her mouth, and the sharp ends were thurst through  the flesh of her lower Lip, so that they projected outside  over her Chin. And these She wore for an ornament to her  person. She was naked, and her body painted, or smeared  of as red a colour, as the sign of the Red Lion near the  Market Place in Ludlow used to be.  The Europeans who reside here, live after the manner  they do in Europe, and their drink is generally Coffee,  which here growes wild, & is very plenty.  The successful publication recently of the diary of an American soldier in the Revolutionary War suggests that there  would be a market for an edition of Thomas's journal. There  are problems, of course: the writing is sometimes illegible;  Thomas often employs a kind of patois composed of several  languages, and he now and then spells words backward; more  than one hand seems to have supplied matter to the journal.  But the solving of these problems would only add to the pleasure  involved in arriving at a characterization of a man interesting  in himself but also engaged in dangerous activities in a romantic  time and place.  13 	asu06600000130019001							63411872 Bytes	3780	5590	920049634	RGB	8	600	asu06600000130019001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/691	691	692.jp2	/asu0660/image/692.jp2
Voltaire's Library in Exile					Muller, Leonard																											asu0660000013	Voltaire's Library in Exile  Leonard Muller  THE CATALOGUE of Voltaire's personal library, published by the Academy of Sciences of the USSR in  Leningrad and Moscow and recently acquired by the  University of Miami, is an invaluable instrument for charting the  movement of ideas in 18th-century Europe.  It may on first thought seem strange that an item so integrally  a part of French history should have been published in Russia  rather than in France. The anomaly is easily explained: after  Voltaire's death in 1778, his library passed into the hands of  Catherine of Russia.  Catherine, who greatly admired the French philosophers and  encyclopedists, bought the library from Mme. Denis, Voltaire's  niece and heir — a woman more partial toward money than  toward metaphysics — for the cash sum of 30,000 rubles ($16,-  000 gold) and a bonus of furs and diamonds. The books were  transported to St. Petersburg and housed in the palace of the  Hermitage. Wagnieres, Voltaire's last secretary, accompanied the  shipment and directed the shelving of the books.  The Empress had originally planned to build a replica of Voltaire's chateau at Ferney on the grounds of the Hermitage, but  this sentimental project was never realized. In 1861, the entire  collection was moved to the Imperial Public Library of Saint  Petersburg, now the State Public Library of Leningrad. It has  been resting there ever since, rarely visited and even less disturbed.  Prior to the October Revolution of 1917, few scholars from  outside Russia had had opportunity for thorough examination  of the collection, chiefly because no one was permitted to consult more than five volumes in a given day. Whether this ruling  was due to the zeal of the librarians trying to protect the collection or to the anti-French and anti-libertarian attitude of Catherine's successors to the throne we can only guess. But the fact remains that, through the years, only a small number of reports,  rather summary ones at that, were written on the contents of the  library.  As might be expected, the Revolution made research by non-  • 14 	asu06600000130020001							62399060 Bytes	3728	5576	1460814375	RGB	8	600	asu06600000130020001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/692	692	693.jp2	/asu0660/image/693.jp2

However, in  1927, two American Voltaire scholars, professors George R.  Havens of Ohio State University and Norman L. Torrey, now of  Columbia but then at Yale, obtained permission to work in the  Leningrad Library without restrictions. They were able during  the few weeks of the summer they spent there to establish a catalogue of the titles in the collection. They were asked not to publish this catalogue until it should appear in Russia. It is this scientifically established catalogue which, thirty-four years after the  Havens-Torrey visit, was finally published in 1961 and is now  in the Richter Library.  The catalogue is excellently organized and it is no surprise  to learn that three generations of librarians have worked on it  over a twenty-year period. The list of titles is preceded by articles  dealing with the history of the collection, listing the various  papers published about it, stating its characteristics, and giving  instructions on how to use the catalogue. This latter part can be  of particular help to those interested in the intellectual climate  of the 18th Century and especially in Voltaire's methods of  working and gathering his documentation.  The most important feature of the catalogue is the system of  symbols placed after many of the 3,876 titles listed. These symbols indicate those places where notes, corrections or other signs  of attentive reading appear. They tell us, furthermore, whether  those notes are numerous or scarce and whether they are in the  hand of Voltaire or in that of his secretaries. This information  makes it possible for students to request photostatic or microfilm  copies of those volumes of particular interest to them. Further,  with the help of this documentation, it is possible to follow, almost step by step, the germination and later development of  ideas to their final expression in Voltaire's own writings.  In addition to the catalogue of printed volumes, which is the  core of the work, there is a list of some 200 notebooks made up  of clippings from journals, reviews, and even at times of whole  chapters taken out of books. These notebooks, titled "Pot-pourris", are often on one single subject. Others are really pot-pourri.  Their contents are listed, and here again we have indications of  what interested the writer most, and clear leads on how selective  • 15 	asu06600000130021001							63922704 Bytes	3809	5592	1762804467	RGB	8	600	asu06600000130021001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/693	693	694.jp2	/asu0660/image/694.jp2

The accusations that he took research lightly and was disinclined to supply  documentation—made both by his contemporaries and by later  critics—are here shown to be unfounded.  These features—the manuscript notes, remarks, laudatory or  vituperative exclamations scattered through the majority of the  volumes, and the notebooks of clippings—confirm once more  that Voltaire's library was a working library and not that of a  bibliophile. It is now possible, thanks to this remarkable piece of  cataloguer's work, for the researcher to find his way among and  to use the very working tools of the most important writer of the  Age of Enlightenment.

Five Years of the Cuban Novel					Abella, Rosa M.																											asu0660000013	Five Years of the Cuban Novel  Rosa M. Abella  SINCE IT IS considered the outstanding literary expression  of Latin America in the twentieth century, much has  been written about the novel by the best-known critics  of the Spanish-speaking world. For these critics the form has not  only literary importance but also significant documentary value.  "The novel has been among us," says Jose Antonio Portuondo,  "a warning document, a poster of doctrinal propaganda, a call  for attention to the most serious and urgent social problems . . ."  Truly, where can we better come to an understanding of the  Mexican Revolution than in Mariano Azuela's novel Los de  A bajo? How can we better realize the tragedy of the Ecuadorian  farmers than by reading Euasipungo by Jorge Icaza? Where can  we find so broad a survey of mid-nineteenth-century Cuban life  as in Cirilo Villaverde's Cecilia Valdesl  Each of these novels vividly portrays the era it treats; each  serves as an invaluable complement to historical studies. Indeed,  such novels have values for those interested in studying and  judging the reality which they present in fictional form which  raise them above mere histories. German Arciniegas writes in  his essay Entre la libertad y el miedo: "The Latin American novel  is considered, in a general way, as a document more accurate  than History ... it is free from the limitations of the official  reports ... it contains better details and facts for placing any  event than the real documents."  It was not until the Romantic period reached its highest moment with Cirilo Villaverde's Cecilia Vaides that Cuba produced  her first novel; gradually others have followed. But still we think  that while there have been novels written in Cuba and novels  written about Cuba, there has not as yet been produced a Cuban  Novel; there has not developed a novelistica in the full sense and  significance of the word. This does not mean that writers like  Avellaneda, Carrion, Loveira, Castellanos, Hernandez Cata  (better known for his short stories), Lino Novas Calvo, Enrique  Serpa, Alejo Carpentier, and Gregorio Ortega have not achieved  prominence as good novelists in Cuban literature, simply that  even they have not created a novelistica cubana propiamente.  • 17 	asu06600000130023001							63625916 Bytes	3792	5591	1793392567	RGB	8	600	asu06600000130023001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/695	695	696.jp2	/asu0660/image/696.jp2
Five Years of the Cuban Novel					Abella, Rosa M.																											asu0660000013	The large number of novels being written today on the Island  still does not indicate the presence of enough of the characteristics necessary to ensure the birth of a novelistica. Julian Gorkin,  in his preface to La muerte en el paraiso by the Chilean Alberto  Baeza Flores, states that Cuba has not had  ... a real novelistica. Would I be told that a real novelistica is a work achieved only at the state of maturity?  This is only half the truth; a novel simultaneously objective,  serene, strong and deep can be achieved only in maturity;  but I am referring to that special novel-testimony or novel-  document born from an exciting event.  From the novels published in Cuba by Cubans during the  years 1960-1965 I have chosen those of most significance for  brief discussion, recognizing that there are others also worthy  of attention and study.  The first of these is La situacion by Lisandro Otero. It is a  novel designed on two levels: one of them recalls the past to  give the background of two families; the other describes the  present situation, beginning with the years preceding Batista's  fall. It is an interesting novel, especially for the "habanero,"  since it is necessary to know from experience the light and glare  of life at the Island capital to grasp fully its truth to the time  and place. The constant reference to topical situations, the costumes, the specific objects — the general way of life in Havana  — gives the novel a local color effect which may or may not be  of interest to succeeding generations of readers.  Since La situacion treats in depth only one aspect of the Cuban  bourgeoisie and is both careless and superficial in its depiction  of the Island's social structure, it lacks the revealing contrasts  that would have made it a document of enduring value.  Had Otero thought more deeply, written less verbosely, and  freed himself of the Communist writer's compulsion to attack  a single class, he could have developed La situacion into an  extraordinary novel. It has the power to evoke for the "habanero"  images of the 'fifties, "lost remembrances" of life in the capital  of that time.  Juan Arcocha is another Cuban novelist who chooses the bourgeoisie as his subject. In Los muertos andan solos, Arcocha recounts the adventures of a group of young Cubans of the social  elite before and after Castro's revolution. Selecting what he  • 18 	asu06600000130024001							62685764 Bytes	3744	5579	2332601000	RGB	8	600	asu06600000130024001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/696	696	697.jp2	/asu0660/image/697.jp2
Five Years of the Cuban Novel					Abella, Rosa M.																											asu0660000013	thinks to be a typical segment of this class, he describes their  constant forays back and forth from Varadero to Havana and  records their excited discussions of the events of 1959-60. His  description of the wild life led by these young Cubans is probably  accurate enough. But Arcocha fails in his task of establishing  with any validity the pattern of behavior of the class he is representing. This is in part due to the novel's structural weaknesses.  Still, though not a single character is so deeply realized as to  make a profound moral impression, this is the best — in character-portrayal — of the novels of this period. A good example  is the characterization of the lustful Rosa: she is not typed in  terms of her class but shown as a kind of woman known universally, and Arcocha's treatment of her is consistent from her  first appearance to her last.  Because of the universality of its theme, its linguistic terseness,  and the subtlety of its propaganda line, one of the best novels  of the period is Edmundo Desnoes' No hay problema, the action  of which takes place during the critical years of Batista's dictatorship. It surveys all the social classes and does so with serene  and pondered judgment. Unlike the novels thus far examined,  it analyzes a personal problem rather than the problem of a  group.  The hero, son of a Cuban father and North American mother,  has plunged into an empty life of sexual promiscuity, totally disengaged from political and intellectual concerns. He is awakened,  however, to the fatuity of his existence, recognizes that he cannot  divorce himself, spiritually or physically, from the Island, realizes, indeed, that he must return to face whatever dangers might  await and thus, though it be through death, give meaning to  his life.  Jose Soler Puig has developed his novels in Santiago de Cuba,  a city very familiar to him. His Bertillon 166, a novel dealing  with subversive activity in the cities, evokes the climate of terror  and heroism which pervaded Cuba during the struggle against  Batista. This novel, avidly read by Cubans, was translated into  several languages.  His En el ano de enero (1963), a novel in four chapters and  an epilogue, though it limits its time to the single year of 1959  •  19 	asu06600000130025001							64065484 Bytes	3808	5606	4206647027	RGB	8	600	asu06600000130025001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/697	697	698.jp2	/asu0660/image/698.jp2
Five Years of the Cuban Novel					Abella, Rosa M.																											asu0660000013	and its characters to a group of workers in a small copra factory,  lacks unity. The author's initial purpose seems to have been to  affirm the achievements of Castro's Revolution, but the book  becomes, instead, a critical examination of the Revolution. Its  many episodes — some very likely historically true — emphasize  the change in moral values rather than the political or ideological  shifts occurring in Cuba during that year. For example, one  episode dignifies the behavior of an informer who by his action  becomes responsible for the death of a man shot while trying  to escape.  In El derrumbe (1964), Soler Puig denies the ideas which he  had expressed in Bertillon 166. The novel, laid in Santiago de  Cuba, combines sharp, brief dialogue with interior monologue.  Comparing the past and present ways of life of a member of the  bourgeoisie, it gives a vivid picture of life in the city and of the  collapse of its established social system. But the picture is highly  prejudiced. For Soler Puig, everything related to the past is seen  as unworthy, mischievous, destructive, and everything relating  to the present positive and constructive. Among the characters  of El derrumbe the author includes a mentally disturbed woman,  wife of the protagonist, and through her madness shows the  changes that took place in Cuban society. It is interesting that  this schizophrenic character has a special ability for prompt adaptation to the new life, the new language and the new situations  developed from the Revolution. The clergy come under bitter  attack.  Many novels have been written in Cuba during the past five  years. There is a fever among the new generation to express  themselves in the form. And exciting themes are abundantly  available to them. Some of the novels being published deal with  the events occurring just prior to Castro's taking over the Island;  some deal with the present situation. But few treat of life in the  country and the villages. The city has gained an interest that it  did not have before. This has had an effect upon characterization.  There are few rounded characters in the new Cuban novel. The  individual is overwhelmed by the mass of which he is a part.  Furthermore, the fever to publish has resulted in the production of hurriedly-written, carelessly-plotted stories which at any  • 20 	asu06600000130026001							62736376 Bytes	3745	5582	3115430767	RGB	8	600	asu06600000130026001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/698	698	699.jp2	/asu0660/image/699.jp2
Five Years of the Cuban Novel					Abella, Rosa M.																											asu0660000013	other time would not even have been considered worthy of publication. (Alejo Carpentier's El Sigh de las luces (1963) is  an exception. It is a technically perfect novel, interestingly  plotted and unbelievably rich in language, situation, and description, and has been translated into several languages. But it is  not a product of the Castro Revolution.)  If the novels written in Cuba between 1960 and 1965 are  deficient as novels, what is their value as documents complementing the histories written about the era? Are they as trustworthy  as the document-novels written in other Latin American  countries?  The answer was given by Fidel Castro in Palabras a los inte-  lectuales, a speech addressed in June of 1961 to Cuban artists  and men of letters and replying to their expressions of doubt and  fear regarding the establishment of a government office to supervise all intellectual activity in the Island. He said: "What are  the rights in Cuba of the revolutionary or non-revolutionary  artists and writers? Within the Revolution, all; against the Revolution, not a single right . . . Against the Revolution,  nothing. ..."  As things now stand, the writer in Cuba cannot write a single  word which is not subject to approval and revision by the Im-  prenta Nacional, the only printing organization on the Island.  This being the case, the Cuban novel of 1960-65 can scarcely  have value as an historical document of any objectivity. As for  the Cubans in exile, they have written few novels; and these have  been, as novels, inadequate, missing the tragic, humorous, dramatic, human experiences that exiles undergo. As documents,  some have been openly reactionary.  In brief, there has not been a Cuban novelist, in or out of  Cuba, with the will to undertake the task of writing a significant  and honest fictional study of the Cuban Revolution. Theme,  characters, background, and incidents are waiting. The only  thing needed is a Cuban novelist, patient and honest, writing  with sincerity in a climate of freedom.  21 	asu06600000130027001							63912648 Bytes	3803	5600	3289501443	RGB	8	600	asu06600000130027001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/699	699	700.jp2	/asu0660/image/700.jp2

Latin American Studies at Miami					McNicoll, Robert E.																											asu0660000018	THE  CARRE LL  Volume 9 December, 1968 Number 2  Latin American Studies at Miami  Robert E. McNicoll  Director Institute of Inter-American Studies  The University's dedication to Latin American studies  is as old as the University itself. In its Charter of 1925  the University stated its intention "to take advantage  of a unique location between the Americas to promote inter-  American friendship and understanding and to conduct research  in the scientific and technical problems of the tropics." The  founders' vision was clear; both parts of this statement still serve  as a useful guide to further development.  Despite the real estate crash and the devastating hurricane  of the same year, the University managed to open in October  1926, with at least some visible evidences of its intention to  implement the high objectives of its Charter. On the original  faculty were two distinguished men who incarnated the Hispanic  orientation the founders desired. They were Angel del Rio,  Spanish professor trained in the Centro de Estudios Historicos  of Madrid, and Victor Andres Belaunde, Peruvian diplomat  then in exile because of his opposition to a dictatorship in his  own country. These men represented the two poles of the  Hispanic-American program that gradually crystallized at  Miami: a serious study of Spanish literature and civilization  with coordinated attention to Latin American history and  politics. Del Rio represented the quiet, scholarly, contemplation  of literature while Belaunde, a publicist, in his very first year  in Miami, organized a "Pan-American Round Table" which 	asu06600000180003001							64749396 Bytes	3848	5607	2524437229	RGB	8	600	asu06600000180003001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/708	708	709.jp2	/asu0660/image/709.jp2
Latin American Studies at Miami					McNicoll, Robert E.																											asu0660000018	did much to awaken business and professional men of Miami  to the inter-American possibilities of the area—something new  at that time.  Both men were writers and have left important records of  their study and thought. Angel del Rio left Miami after three  years, to join Columbia University where he spent most of the  remainder of his life, the last years as head of the Casa de las  Espahas. He published anthologies and studies of Spanish  literature1 and—as his last work—finally ventured to speak of  Spain's importance in the shaping of "Anglo-Saxon" America.2  Belaunde's bibliography is lengthy. Of interest here is a work  produced at Miami—Bolivar and the Political Thought of the  Spanish-American Revolutions.3 This work which Dr. Belaunde  wrote in Spanish was put into English for the Albert Shaw  lectures of 1930 at Johns Hopkins. On Dr. del Rio's nomination, a sophomore at the U. of Miami undertook the task of  translation.4 The translation was duly delivered for use at Johns  Hopkins but Dr. Belaunde was inspired to add another chapter  which had to wait until 1938 when a diplomatic assignment  gave him time in Washington to finish his work. The publication appeared in 1938 with full acknowledgments to Miami,  to the translator, and to Dr. Belaunde's secretary Miss Alberta  Losh, who later taught Portuguese at the University.  The original two Hispanists on the Miami faculty were reinforced between 1929 and 1934 with several additions to the  faculty. Dr. Rafael Belaunde, brother of Victor Andres, came  to Miami in the first year mentioned to teach Spanish and to  initiate courses in "Economic Geography of Latin America"  and "Economic Problems of Latin America."5 In 1931 political  disorders in Cuba brought to Miami Dr. Luis A. Baralt, then  professor of English at the Instituto de La Habana. As Dr.  Baralt was also a key member of the revolutionary ABC organization, it may be said that he came to Miami for his health.  Later Professor of Philosophy at the University of Habana  and presently Professor at Southern Illinois University, Dr.  Baralt is a philosopher, playwright, poet, and linguist with  mastery of French and English, as well as Spanish.6 He was  born in New York during the struggle for Cuban independence. 	asu06600000180004001							64883136 Bytes	3825	5651	1502324776	RGB	8	600	asu06600000180004001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/709	709	710.jp2	/asu0660/image/710.jp2
Latin American Studies at Miami					McNicoll, Robert E.																											asu0660000018	His mother was an American—also a talented author and  lecturer.7 Dr. Baralt taught Spanish American literature and  strengthened the approach to Latin America through belles-  lettres, a route overshadowed by the political and historical  approach of the Belaundes, once Dr. del Rio had left for  Columbia. In 1933 both Belaundes were called by their government to head diplomatic missions and it was necessary to  replace them. The substitutes were Rafael Belaunde, Jr., a  dynamic and intelligent young man with great dreams for a  Pan-American university in Miami, and the writer, who left  the Dade County highschools to become an instructor.  It is notable that on April 13, 1934, the Hurricane carried a  lead story on "History of Pan-Americanism at the University  of Miami." In the same number, Dr. John Barrett, former  Director General of the Pan American Union, suggested that  the University change its name to "Pan American University."  Barrett said: "Metropolitan Miami approaches nearer to being  the ideal home of such a university than any other city or port  located on the coast lines of North and South America."8  The same number of the Hurricane was dedicated "to the  interest of Pan-Americanism, a spirit which is being ably fostered  by Rafael Belaunde, acting head of the Latin American department and his assistants." It is interesting that the term "Pan  American" has lost some of the glamor it had in those days—  a glamor not conveyed by the more prosaic term "Inter-  American".  In 1934 a very important addition was made in the person  of Dr. Juan Clemente Zamora, of the University of Habana.  Zamora, Professor of Constitutional Law at the Cuban institution, had Harvard undergraduate and law degrees and had  studied at the Sorbonne and at Columbia.9 As the University of  Habana was closed because of the revolution against Machado,  Dr. Zamora came to teach various courses on Latin America  in the field of Political Science. Dr. Zamora was instrumental  also in bringing to Miami a large number of Cuban students  who could not attend school in Cuba because of the closing of  the University which continued from 1930 to 1936. Some sixty  Cuban students received most of their education at Miami 	asu06600000180005001							65249980 Bytes	3855	5640	270284460	RGB	8	600	asu06600000180005001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/710	710	711.jp2	/asu0660/image/711.jp2
Latin American Studies at Miami					McNicoll, Robert E.																											asu0660000018	during this period and they include such people as Dr. Luis  Rodriguez Molina,93 now on the Miami faculty, Dr. Bias Roca-  fort, practicing lawyer in Miami, Dr. Antonio Cardona, medical  doctor at George Washington Hospital in Washington, D.C.,  Engineer Angel Ruiz, former Cuban Ambassador to Czechoslovakia, Josefina Yarina, Professor of English, University  of Habana, and many others.  The enterprise of Dr. Zamora which had the greatest impact  on the Miami community was a "Latin American Forum" which  continued in slightly different form the "Pan American Round  Table" founded by Dr. Belaunde. The most interesting sessions  of this Forum were held in early 1935 concerning the Cuban  revolution, not yet stabilized at that date. In two lectures, "Cuba  Yesterday," and "Cuba Today," Dr. Luis Baralt summarized  the hectic past and present of the island republic. Dr. Zamora,  in arranging the rejoinders permitted to the second lecture,  allowed each Cuban party and point of view and its speaker  "equal time" so that Miami could provide what was not possible  in Cuba, a full and frank examination of the political scene.  The "Machadistas" who had lost place and fortunes in Cuba  and who were exiled in Miami were the most vociferous but  Grau's Autenticos and old-time Liberals and Conservatives  were not far behind. For the Anglo-American listeners the  debate constituted an unforgettable experience.  Another inter-American experience of importance was the  celebration of Pan American Day on April 14, 1934. Cuba  was the country honored and sent a naval vessel, an armed  marching unit, and three official civilian delegates to participate  in the affair. The first notes of inter-Americanism were sour  when the armed unit made up of both blacks and whites was  told by the City of Miami committee that accomodations for  them were available only on a segregated basis. Quite properly  they said that they had fought together and had served together  and would stay together. Finally cots were brought for all hands  and they slept in the sheet-iron warehouses of the port of Miami.  At the University assembly a more pleasant surprise took  place. Everyone expected a broken-English statement from the  Cuban speaker. Instead, Dr. Jorge Maiiach, scholarship student 	asu06600000180006001							65129072 Bytes	3837	5656	1541353144	RGB	8	600	asu06600000180006001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/711	711	712.jp2	/asu0660/image/712.jp2
Latin American Studies at Miami					McNicoll, Robert E.																											asu0660000018	at the Boston Latin School and Phi Beta Kappa from Harvard,  arose and delivered an eloquent address in impeccable English.  At the time he was Secretary of State and represented the same  ABC party mentioned before in connection with Dr. Baralt.  In the years 1935 to 1937, other faculty changes were made  at the University. The writer went off to Duke to obtain his  Ph.D., and Dr. J. Riis Owre joined the faculty to teach Spanish.  Zamora departed for the re-opened University of Habana. In  1937, on McNicoll's return, Dr. Owre and he worked out a  program which placed Miami in the forefront—at least historically—of the schools offering area-studies concentrations  on Latin America. The "Hispanic-American Major" then  founded and still in existence, provided a means by which  students could concentrate on the language, the literature, the  history and the civilization of Latin America. This was at a  time when no other school gave such a major and the term  "area studies" had not come into use. In the beginning, the  program included the equivalent of a Spanish major plus a  series of courses on Latin America within several social science  disciplines (history, economics, government, geography). Over  the years, changes took place in this major to decrease the  amount of required Spanish and to increase the number of  departments in which Latin American studies could be pursued.  As of now, these include eight separate departments or schools  and there are plans to add one or two more in the near future.  In 1939 a lecture series and a publication were added to the  Latin American sector of activities. The "Hispanic-American  Institute" came into being to coordinate Latin American activities under the co-directorship of Owre and McNicoll. A lecture  series was held in 1939, the proceedings being published as  Hispanic-American Studies,10 the University's first academic  publication. The speakers and writers at the first session give  a good idea of the quality involved:  Dr. John Tate Lanning (Head, Hispanic Studies, Duke University).  Dr. Homero Seris   (then direct from Madrid,  Centro de  Estudios Historicos).  ■ 	asu06600000180007001							64657348 Bytes	3822	5637	2289564932	RGB	8	600	asu06600000180007001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/712	712	713.jp2	/asu0660/image/713.jp2

H. Callcott (retired Dean Graduate School, University  of South Carolina).  Dr. J. Fred Rippy (now Emeritus, University of Chicago).  The publication was circulated throughout the Americas and  produced great academic prestige for the program and—very  concretely—enriched the Library with hundreds of Latin American books and journals received in exchange. Impetus given  by the lecture series and the publication was noticeable the  following year, 1940, when the lecturers included Juan Ramon  Jimenez, Spanish poet and the first Nobel prize winner to be  associated with the University. Others were Rafael Pico, Puerto  Rican geographer and destined to become the principal architect  of "Operation Bootstrap" that brought his country out of the  depression doldrums; Victor Lascano, Argentine Ambassador  to Cuba, and others.  During this same period the faculty included as visiting professors Dr. Salvador Massip, Geographer of the University of  Habana, and Mr. Enrique Noble, Latin Americanist now at  Goucher College. Miami offered Portuguese courses at this  time with a young instructor Jose De Seabra, now a senior  interpreter with the Department of State.  After Pearl Harbor and the advent of World War II, Hispanic  Studies at Miami suffered some decline as many faculty members  were involved in a Navy V-12 program for the training of deck  officers while other faculty members went directly into military  or other government service. Between 1945 and 1948 activities  picked up with the return of faculty and the appointment of  new members such as lone S. Wright, Robert S. Chamberlain,  Robert C. Beyer, Harry Stark, and David Stern. Dr. Rafael  Belaunde was among those to return, staying at Miami until  retirement.  One interesting experiment, where Miami was again ahead  of the times, took place in 1945-56 when the Hispanic-American  Institute became a teaching unit rather than a coordinating  agency as it had been.

Latin American Studies at Miami					McNicoll, Robert E.																											asu0660000018	Allen, author of Anthony Adverse and other famous works, Dr.  Ashe had agreed to the establishment of a special training  program for veterans and others who wished to make a career  for themselves in Latin America. The principal study in the  six-months course was Spanish, to which four hours daily was  devoted. The head language teacher was professor Robert  Whitehouse, who came from Birmingham-Southern College for  this purpose. Native informants—all Cubans—included later  professors of the University, notably Dr. Gloria de la Vega,  whose association with the University began at that time. In  addition, lectures were given in Spanish on Latin American  civilization by many authorities, including Latin American  visitors as well as regular faculty members. These included Dr.  Luis A. Baralt, back as Visiting Professor under a special grant  by the U.S. Department of State. The site used was the Koubek  Center, then a new acquisition of the University, still without  the classrooms that were later added. Director of this entire  operation was Dr. Robert E. McNicoll who had returned from  wartime service in the State Department to be presented with  the establishment of the new institute as a required task on his  return. The choice was not difficult—either he undertook the  task or the one who did so would become his boss. After two  cycles of six months each in which twelve students were the  guinea pigs, the project was abandoned when the director requested changes in the building to make it a Casa Hispanoamer-  icana with housing and food services for the students all in a  self-contained unit. Inasmuch as all University efforts were then  directed to moving to the new (present) campus there were no  funds for such luxuries. As housing was the principal need for  the veterans concerned, the project came to an end. As its  epitaph, it may be remarked that it was a pedagogical success  but an economic failure. Despite the GI bill that paid reasonable tuition for veterans, there was no beneficent government  to support "total immersion" in the language which is now  considered a most effective teaching means. Miami, as on  other occasions, was ahead of the currents of the time and so  had to buck its own way.

Latin American Studies at Miami					McNicoll, Robert E.																											asu0660000018	Ralph S. Boggs came to Miami from Chapel Hill to teach  Spanish phonetics, Spanish-American folklore and Old Spanish.  Several years later he became the founder and director of the  International Center which replaced the older Institute. Although Latin America continued to be the principal area focus  of the University, the new Center was in charge of all foreign  students and coordinated all international programs. Dr. Boggs  worked in combination with many civic bodies such as the  Alianza Interamericana, the Coral Gables People-to-People Program, The Chamber of Commerce of the Americas, and many  others. (The number of foreign students at Miami kept rising  until in 1967 Miami with 2067 foreign students was fourth in  the nation among universities. As the 1968 number of foreign  students is reported as more than 2,600, it is possible that  Miami's relative position has improved.)  To bring the account nearer to the present, the following  may be added: In 1964, an Institute of Inter-American Studies  was authorized with the Center for Advanced International  Studies to give inter-disciplinary instruction on the graduate  level. Work started on these courses in 1965 and the first students who are candidates for an M.A. in Inter-American Studies  submitted theses in 1968. Meanwhile, on June 13, 1967, the  Board of Trustees of the University approved the granting of  the Ph.D. in Inter-American Studies, the first to be granted in  June of 1970.

Jose Guadalupe Posada, Mexican "Guerilla Fighter of the Throwaways"					Storm, Larue Stinger																											asu0660000018	Jose Guadalupe Posada,  Mexican "Guerilla Fighter of the  Throwaways"  By  Larue Stinger Storm  This article served as the introduction to a thesis under the  same title offered for the Master of Arts Degree in History at  the University of Miami, awarded in June 1967. A copy of the  thesis is in the University of Miami's Richter Library.  Jose Guadalupe Posada witnessed and faithfully recorded  the social struggle of Mexico during the two decades prior  to the Revolution of 1910. The "guerrilla fighter of the  throwaways" was printmaker, caricaturist, gadfly of the Porfirio  Diaz regime. When Diaz became president of Mexico in 1876,  Posada was twenty-four years of age. He lived almost two years  beyond the old dictator's abdication in 1911, long enough  to portray the triumphal entry of Diaz's successor, Francisco  Madero, into Mexico City.  During the intervening three decades of the Porfiriato, Mexico  had evolved from a debt-ridden, strife-torn, world-isolated republic, into a nation internationally respected for its potential  for further material development. The order and progress in  Mexico, eulogized by its foreign visitors during the Centennial  of 1910, was more apparent than real; they had been bought  at too high a price, as the Revolution of the same year attested.  Order and Progress, the credo of Diaz and his cientifico advisors, appeared to have been fulfilled; nevertheless, many of  the upper and middle classes who had benefited by this credo  were dissatisfied, while the lower class, ninety per cent of the  population, remained alien in its own country, uneducated,  landless, hopelessly trapped by economic, political and social  deprivations.  Considered as a whole, the thousands of Posada's graphics  give us a pictorial view of the Porfirio Diaz regime and the  varied strata of society of which it was composed. In his picture  •   11 	asu06600000180013001							65328416 Bytes	3859	5641	1888290700	RGB	8	600	asu06600000180013001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/718	718	719.jp2	/asu0660/image/719.jp2
Jose Guadalupe Posada, Mexican "Guerilla Fighter of the Throwaways"					Storm, Larue Stinger																											asu0660000018	drama of the Porfiriato we find a full cast of characters: the  protagonist, Diaz, hero or tyrant; the supporting principals comprised of the middle and upper class militarists, jefes politicos,  Church officials, wealthy land-owners, intellectuals, and foreign  investors; and finally the chorus, the lower class peon, the  Indian and mestizo worker. Although Posada brought to life  the devil and the angel in all classes, his sympathy obviously  lay with the underdog; and if in his caricatures the peon fared  badly at times, the political-religious-military-foreign hierarchy  generally fared worse.  Posada was a reporter, and as such his graphics presented  the full panorama of the Porfiriato: executions, crimes, miracles,  inaugurations, anti-reelection riots, social and political events.  Jose Clemente Orozco recalled hearing the newsboys hawking  the Vanegas Arroyo broadsheets illustrated by Posada, with  cries of "Execution of Captain Cota," or "Horrible crime of  the most horrible son who killed his horrible mother." When  the village of Tomochic was levelled by federal troops he protested; when the clergy misused their office he lampooned them:  when a new railroad was inaugurated he hailed it as a sign of  progress; when Madero announced his candidacy for president  he portrayed him as a saint. He also illustrated songs, prayers,  books, secular and religious calendars, children's games, moral  tales, and corridos.  Considering the importance of Jose Guadalupe Posada as  social commentator and artist, comparatively little is known of  his life. A rather tenuous biography has been pieced together  from sources including civil records and birth, marriage and  death certificates; recollections of fellow students in Aguascal-  ientes where he was born; and anecdotes remembered by the  Vanegas Arroyo publishing family with whom he was associated  in Mexico City for almost a quarter of a century. Lack of  biographical data is not surprising since Posada died in 1913.  and it was not until the mid-twenties that Jean Chariot called  attention to the importance of his graphics to contemporary  Mexican Art.  Since then a monograph reproducing 406 prints from the  original plates was published in Mexico in 1930; a folio of 100  •   12 	asu06600000180014001							64609180 Bytes	3801	5664	1829153195	RGB	8	600	asu06600000180014001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/719	719	720.jp2	/asu0660/image/720.jp2

Several decades after his death, Posada's work began to  receive international recognition. Between 1937 and 1944  small exhibitions of his graphics circulated in Spain, France,  New York and Mexico. The Secretary of Public Instruction in  1943 sponsored a comprehensive exhibition in the Palacio de  las Bellas Artes in Mexico City, and established a salon named  for Posada where his works were to be exhibited permanently.  In 1944 the Art Institute of Chicago collaborated with the  Mexican government in organizing an important exhibition of  his work. It circulated in other cities in the United States the  two following years.  While many of the plates have been destroyed, and much of  the original printed material was never considered worthy of  saving, Posada's name and style are now widely recognized.  Consequently, much of what does remain of his thousands of  graphics is being salvaged as it comes to light, and it is hoped  that more biographical material as well will be discovered.  It is evident that Jose Guadalupe Posada is important to the  art historian. One of these, Laurence E. Schmeckebier wrote:  The greatness of Guadalupe Posada lies in the fact that with  regard to both spiritual content and artistic form his work,  rooted as it is in the popular mind and art, reveals the first signs  of a sound integration of ancient and colonial Spanish elements.  The transition from Posada to the monumental frescoes of the  new movement can be seen in the graphic art of Jose Clemente  Orozco ..."  •   13 	asu06600000180015001							65166344 Bytes	3846	5646	2232323543	RGB	8	600	asu06600000180015001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/720	720	721.jp2	/asu0660/image/721.jp2
Jose Guadalupe Posada, Mexican "Guerilla Fighter of the Throwaways"					Storm, Larue Stinger																											asu0660000018	Why then is Posada of interest to the social-political historian  as well?  Posada, a full-fledged artist and social commentator, moved  to Mexico City about 1889, at the beginning of Porfirio Diaz's  third term. From then until his death in 1913 he recorded daily  events, both important and trivial, in the Mexican nation and  in the lives of its people. It has been estimated that he produced  15,000 graphics during that period. Posada has bequeathed  to the social-political historian, then, a comprehensive visual  record of the Porfirio Diaz regime. It included a number of  graphics which were testament to a vociferous opposition which  existed at a time when, according to Hubert Herring, "The  press was muzzled but a few editors . . . were ready to risk  imprisonment or death by writing their minds." Posada was  one of them. He took these risks along with the dissenting  publishers for whom he illustrated. This visual record also questioned the regime's claim to Order and Progress as proclaimed  in the Centennial of 1910; questions sustained by the Revolution of the same year which was caused by many of the regime's  failures as delineated by Posada during the two preceding  decades.  In 1910 there was dissatisfaction at all levels of society.  Many mestizos resented the regime's favoritism shown to Creoles  and foreigners, and they sympathized with the struggle of labor  and small proprietors for economic and social progress. Some  of the Creoles, the favored class during the latter part of the  regime, were fearful of the perpetuation of a cientifico dictatorship, and one of them led the Revolution. The people whose  pesos purchased less and less of the staples of life could anticipate only a wage level approaching starvation. The unrest, the  injustices, the inequalities, the failures of the regime were denounced daily by Posada, and the message of his graphics could  have been considered the "handwriting on the wall" if those  in power had chosen to read it. Posada produced mainly for the  Mexican lower class, consequently it is doubtful that many  of the elite read or took seriously his social comments. Obviously  the people themselves did respond to it.  This thesis is divided into three chapters.

Jose Guadalupe Posada, Mexican "Guerilla Fighter of the Throwaways"					Storm, Larue Stinger																											asu0660000018	material regarding the life of Jose Guadalupe Posada is available  in English, we have presented a brief biography in Chapter  One. Biographical data is integrated with the political background of the regimes during which Posada came to maturity,  and which afforded training for his penetrating observations of  the Porfiriato.  Chapter Two discusses the artistic milieu, both urban and  country, from which he fiinally evolved a style to which the  illiterate masses responded, a natural response because this  style drew mainly upon indigenous art forms as expressed by  the people themselves.  Chapter Three is devoted to the exposition of sixty-three  graphics, part of a larger body, which establish Posada as both  social-political and artistic revolutionary. We can only conjecture  as to the importance of the response of the masses to these  graphics, and to what degree they may have aided in inciting  the Mexican people to revolt in 1910. It is our belief that  Posada's graphics were a factor. We do know that thousands  of them were distributed to far-flung hacienda and rancho.  Eighty-four per cent of the people were illiterate and consequently were primarily interested in the illustrations of the  colored broadsheets which sold for one centavo. Along with  news of sensational crimes and current social events, the  peasants learned of Indian deportations, land grabbing, inhuman treatment of agricultural and industrial workers, executions and other injustices which were taking place. Even a  sampling of Posada's graphics, as demonstrated in Chapter  Three, will support the conjecture that they helped to form  public opinion and awareness of social, economic and political  inequalities, and so aided in fomenting resistance to the Diaz  regime when given leadership. Had Order and Progress existed  for the Mexican masses, the Revolution of 1910 could not  have drawn sustenance from the thousands of peons who rallied  to support the Creoles and mestizos who instigated it. "The  movement, once initiated, soon took a different turn. The  Mexicans, so to speak, discovered themselves and turned their  eyes toward their own people." Mexico eventually was to  oust foreign cultural and economic domination and to draw  •   15 	asu06600000180017001							39340186 Bytes	3833	5700	1318354927	RGB	8	600	asu06600000180017001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/722	722	723.jp2	/asu0660/image/723.jp2
Jose Guadalupe Posada, Mexican "Guerilla Fighter of the Throwaways"					Storm, Larue Stinger																											asu0660000018	upon its own native resources. As artist, Posada had already  taken this step toward Mexican self-awareness twenty years  earlier, when he discarded foreign stylistic borrowings and drew  upon Mexican art forms. In native visual language they understood, he spoke to his countrymen of inequalities which existed  and which demanded repudiation by them. Diego Rivera aptly  evaluated Posada's contribution: "And the monument to Posada;  where is it? who raised it? It lies in those who one day were to  give rise to the Revolution, the workers and the peasants of  Mexico."  Posada's aficionados claim that his greatness may be equated  with that of three renowned European satirists: Jacques Callot,  a seventeenth century graphic artist of extraordinary skill, and  Honore Daumier and Francisco Goya, both satirists of the  eighteenth century. Representations of identical subjects illustrated by these three artists and by Posada make interesting  comparisons. A hanging in Goya's "Disaster of the Wars" reproduced in the Complete Etchings of Goya matches a hanging,  obviously a suicide, drawn by Posada for La Gaceta. Edwin T.  Bechtel, in Jacques Callot, includes the French master's magnificently detailed "The Temptation of St. Anthony" as well as six  individual delineations of the "Seven Capital Sins." Reproductions of both subjects as expressed by Posada merit comparison.  And finally, a Posada graphic depicts a murder victim lying in  almost the identical position of the central murder victim in  Daumier's "Rue Transnonain" as reproduced by Carl Zigrosser  in Six Centuries of Fine Prints.  Today few historians would challenge Posada's place as one  of the great Mexican artists of the nineteenth and twentieth  centuries.  16 	asu06600000180018001							39681414 Bytes	3856	5687	2682785478	RGB	8	600	asu06600000180018001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/723	723	724.jp2	/asu0660/image/724.jp2

Elinor Wylie's Novels, Allegories of Love					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000018	Elinor Wylie's Novels,  Allegories of Love  Evelyn Thomas Helmick  If Elinor Wyiie's contribution to the world had been in  the field of mathematics, or science, or even music, much  of this article could be regarded only as malicious gossip  and might better be spread in a whisper to small groups. But  literary criticism assumes a close relationship between a writer's  life and his work. In the case of Elinor Wylie, whose most  frequent theme was herself—as a great beauty, as a poet, as a  lover—knowledge of the details of her life provides valuable  insight into the creative process, particularly with her prose.  Even her poems, she readily admitted, often were disguised  portraits of herself: "Peregrine" is herself and Horace Wylie,  her second husband; "Peter and Paul" are herself and William  Rose Benet. Benet, her third husband, has said that the reader  can know her really only from descriptions in her poems. Her  prose contains even more revelations, none of them inadvertent.  But they are hidden under layers of allegory. She explained her  extensive use of this device in an essay called "Symbols in  Literature":  If you call a spade a diamond some people will think you are  frivolous and affected, but other people will understand how  much blacker things may be said about spades by the simple  trick of pretending that they are diamonds.1  She was even more specific in an interview granted to a newspaper critic: "Certain things," she said, "are so bitter that I  don't want anyone to understand them—hence fantasy."2 By  the time she wrote her novels—during the last five years of  her life—she had accumulated much raw material for allegory,  drawn from many bitter experiences.  Elinor Wylie lived, in the words of one poem, "under a  sky reversed and evil-starred." Whether the result of heavenly  omen or of her own need to defy society, the events of her  life were spectacular. And the lives of the other members of  her family were no less remarkable. There was Morton Hoyt,  •  17 	asu06600000180023001							40850286 Bytes	3843	5729	182437706	RGB	8	600	asu06600000180023001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/728	728	729.jp2	/asu0660/image/729.jp2
Elinor Wylie's Novels, Allegories of Love					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000018	her much younger brother, who, on the dare of a debutante,  jumped from an ocean liner in mid-Atlantic, was rescued and  spent the rest of the voyage in the brig. Soon afterwards, Nancy  Hoyt, their novelist sister, eloped with one man the day before  her long-awaited Washington society wedding to another was  scheduled. Nancy's love affairs over the next few years were  to fill many newspaper columns. Elinor helped to keep alive  the family reputation as a zany one by appearing one night  at Stonehenge and dancing among the monoliths in the belief  that she was a Druid priestess. She always laughed at this story,  since it was at least partly true. More tragically, another brother,  Henry Martyn Hoyt III, truly gifted as painter, etcher, and poet,  asphyxiated himself after a separation from his wife and child.  But it was Elinor Hoyt who attracted the most attention.  She would have done so if only because of her beauty and  background. Granddaughter of a governor of Pennsylvania  and daughter of Theorore Roosevelt's Solicitor-General, she  descended from families of wealth and social position on both  sides. In addition, her exceptional beauty meant that newspapers and periodicals could print an interesting picture with  each story. Later, when she had become a successful poet and  novelist, lines from her works could be used as indictments  against her. They were hardly needed; the facts were startling  enough in themselves.  Her early marriage to Philip Hichborn, son of a Washington  admiral, was disastrous from the beginning. She married him  after a short acquaintance following a disappointment in another  romance. Most accounts state that Philip and Elinor, both  under twenty-one, were married without their parents' knowledge; but in fact the ceremony was performed in the Hoyt  home by the Episcopal Bishop of Washington and attended  by President Roosevelt. Such august presences could not assure  a happy marriage. Just four years later, when her son Philip  was two, Elinor eloped to England with Horace Wylie, a prominent Washingtonian many years her senior.  They lived for six years in England under the name of  Waring—suggested by Browning's line, "What's become of  Waring since he's given us all the slip?"

Elinor Wylie's Novels, Allegories of Love					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000018	memoir, Portrait of an Unknown Lady, describes their life in  rural cottages, completely independent of other people, "steadily  and intensely happy."3 Occasionally a former acquaintance  would appear, eager to impart her knowledge of the Warings'  irregular alliance to the townspeople, forcing Horace and Elinor  to change residence from time to time. More seriously threatening their happiness was Mrs. Wylie's refusal, for six years, to  permit divorce. Rumor said that she wanted Elinor to suffer  the ignominy of producing an illegitimate child, but in spite  of several stillborn children (reports vary from two to eight),  Mrs. Wylie waited until Horce, a millionaire, settled most of  his fortune on her before agreeing to divorce him. The most  disturbing of all developments was Philip Hichborn's suicide.  Elinor convinced her friends that he had manifested suicidal  tendencies during their marriage, that the two-year interval  since her departure proved her not responsible; nevertheless,  her feeling of guilt over Philip's death and the desertion of her  son haunted her for the rest of her life.  During those years in England Horace taught Elinor a great  deal about language and literature. His instruction resulted in  her first book of poetry, unsigned and privately printed, called  Incidental Numbers. Mostly sonnets with conventional themes,  the thirty-four poems give only the slightest indication of her  later craftsmanship.  In 1916, Horace and Elinor found themselves aliens in a  country at war. Since they could now be married, they returned  to the United States. That same year, William Rose Benet, a  Yale classmate of Elinor's brother Henry, began to visit often.  He introduced her to his friends; Edmund Wilson, John Dos  Passos, and Sinclair Lewis, among others, became early admirers  and lifelong friends. More and more her life became involved  with that literary world, and soon she was spending a great  part of her time in New York. In 1922, she sued Wylie for  divorce, although she continued to write under his name and  they remained good friends, exchanging letters until her death.  A letter to an intimate of Elinor's indicates that she was waiting  for the birth of Benet's child at the time, but, like Horace's  children, it was stillborn. In a letter to Benet several years later,  •   19 	asu06600000180025001							39585530 Bytes	3839	5705	1237943168	RGB	8	600	asu06600000180025001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/730	730	731.jp2	/asu0660/image/731.jp2
Elinor Wylie's Novels, Allegories of Love					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000018	i  she said that the greatest regret of her life was her inability  to bear him a child.  Throughout these personal trials, she was plagued by lesser  problems. One was that of the anonymous "rabbits" as Nancy  Hoyt called them, who holed up in Washington bars to spend  their time in gossip. And Elinor was most sensitive to gossip:  she was known to refuse to read her poetry at a party because  a "lady notorious for her aggressive conventionality"4 was sitting  in the audience.4 The father of William Rose and Stephen  Vincent Benet fled to Paris, according to Stephen's biographer,  when the thought of Bill's imminent marriage to Elinor became  unbearable. Her family and most of her friends, however, remained loyal: Carl Van Doren, Dorothy Parker, Padraic and  Mary Colum, James Branch Cabell, Edwin Arlington Robinson  all accepted her high-strung, eccentric behavior. Sometimes it  took courage. Edna St. Vincent Millay, for instance, challenged  the League of American Penwomen, choosing, appropriately  enough, the pen as her weapon. She wrote:  Believe me, if the eminent object of your pusillanimous attack  has not directed her movements in conformity with your timid  philosphies, no more have I mine. I too am eligible for your  disesteem. Strike me too from your lists, and permit me, I beg  you, to share with Elinor Wylie a brilliant exile from your  fusty province.5  The pen was also being flourished, with less finesse, by the  other side. Two untalented lady writers, Anne Parrish and  Kathleen Coyne, etched portraits in acid disguised lightly as  novels. Newspaper writers attacked continuously, if often inaccurately. Any news—the publication of a new book, her  marriage to Benet, a literary visit to Richmond—became a  pretext for moralizing. At her death, such a cynic as Heywood  Broun wrote a column to lament the treatment given Elinor  Wylie during her lifetime by his colleagues.  These, then, were some of the bitternesses to be dealt with  as allegory when she began, at the urging of Sinclair Lewis  and Henry Seidel Sanby, to write prose. Her alliance with  Benet led to her period of literary growth: from the time she  decided to marry him in 1923 until her death five years later  she wrote four novels and three further volumes of poetry.  •  20 	asu06600000180026001							40708142 Bytes	3876	5695	3540768255	RGB	8	600	asu06600000180026001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/731	731	732.jp2	/asu0660/image/732.jp2
Elinor Wylie's Novels, Allegories of Love					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000018	Nets to Catch the Wind, her first poems, and the occasional  stories for the New Yorker and Vanity Fair were merely adequate work. But from this time on, the critics almost unanimously agreed, "both her prose and her poetry grew perceptibly  from mere brilliance and erudite polish to work of unquestioned  genius."6  Her attitude toward her novels was strange, often ambivalent.  She refused to call them novels, preferring "sedate extravaganza"  for Jennifer Lorn, and "symbolic romance of the mind" for  Mr. Hodge and Mr. Hazard. She liked very much one friend's  description of Orphan Angel as "celestial fooling." That her  material for her prose was very close at hand is revealed by  her method of composition: she wrote a single draft at the  typewriter, seldom changing a word and never bothering to  make a carbon, to the consternation of her publisher. And yet  her books are not casual; her serapbooks now in the Yale  Library show that she took hundreds of pages of scholarly notes  before she began to write. She spent days verifying that a pocket  edition of Plato such as Mr. Hazard read was available in  London during the period she was writing about. She resented  the time that her novels took away from her poetry writing, but  she regretted finishing Orphan Angel because its creation had  so absorbed her. Contradictions about her prose often appear  in her correspondence too. She was capable of saying in one  letter that people took her novels too seriously; in another,  that they could not recognize the meaning in them.  But her inconsistencies disappeared as she became the disciplined artist whose purpose was clear when she could refine  the rather messy experiences of her life into an orderly expression of their meaning. Each of her novels, undoubtedly,  can be analyzed just in this way—as symbolic of the conflict  she felt between the demands of life and the demands of art.  In each one, art is the stronger of the demands.  Her first novel, Jennifer Lorn, explores the period of Elinor  Wylie's early awareness of the need to forge nature into art—  that period of her marriage to Horace Wylie. The story of  Jennifer, as Harriet Monroe said in Poetry Magazine, has "never  a trace of reality in the whole concoction." Jennifer Lorn, we  • 21 	asu06600000180027001							41054798 Bytes	3848	5712	529871850	RGB	8	600	asu06600000180027001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/732	732	733.jp2	/asu0660/image/733.jp2

Gerald  Poynyard, a minor nobleman and collector of objects of art,  decides that she is an exactly suitable object to help furnish  his palace in India. All that is demanded of her is that she  dress only in black or white and pose beautifully in the drawing  room. She is able to languish this way (dreaming, it must be  confessed, of a mildly exciting romance) until Gerald is  wounded and left for dead during a journey through India.  Jennifer is carried to the Khan's palace, where she is told she  must eat mutton fat (she who is accustomed to artichoke hearts  and almond milk) to make her plump enough to please the  Khan or she will be stuffed with pistachio nuts and served to  him for dinner. Faced with these alternatives, she does what  any enterprising woman would do under the circumstances—  she faints. But, luckier than most, she revives in the arms of a  prince.  Prince Abbas is a denial of everything that Gerald represents:  he is young, emotional, completely natural, and impetuous.  Jennifer's lethargy immediately disappears, and the two decide  to escape the palace together. But as Jennifer catches a glimpse  of a revived Gerald, she realizes that escape is impossible. She  returns to the palace, hoping to find her husband, but finds  instead only imprisonment and then death. The Prince dies  of a broken heart on her grave, as Gerald walks slowly through  an eighteenth century garden, dressed in white linen and holding  one perfect rose.  The theme of the conflict between art and nature is obvious  even in this short summary. Less obvious is the tone of the  novel. It manages beautiful lyricism of baroque descriptions  along with a burlesque of many earlier novels—Tom Jones,  Vathek, Orlando, and Rasselas among them. She meant to  emphasize the satirical, even using as a working title, The Lady  Stuffed with Pistachio Nuts. With the title changed to Jennifer  Lorn, many readers missed the satire as well as the pun; so many  that Elinor Wylie wrote to Carl Van Vechten:  You are the most delightful person to like Jennifer, and above  all I bless you for thinking she is funny, instead of piling the  responsibilities of an historical novel upon her porcelain  shoulders.7  •   22 	asu06600000180028001							40634054 Bytes	3849	5712	2412200327	RGB	8	600	asu06600000180028001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/733	733	734.jp2	/asu0660/image/734.jp2
Elinor Wylie's Novels, Allegories of Love					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000018	No one realized that Elinor Wylie was analyzing and satirizing  herself at the same time. Characters and events in the novel  have very apparent parallels in her own fife. Nancy Hoyt wrote  of the physical resemblance of Gerald Poynyard to Horace  Wylie; certainly it was Horace who taught the young, untutored  Elinor the discipline of art and beauty as Gerald taught Jennifer.  Elinor consciously identified with poor Jenny (as she did with  all her leading characters). In a letter to Benet written as she  worked on the novel, she said, "I lay supine—quite like Jennifer  —all day, glad enough to be alone and neither read nor write."  And the romantic Prince Abbas, whom Jennifer had to escape,  most certainly represents Benet. Perhaps the more earthy,  less rarified atmosphere of the world of Abbas-Benet and his  journalist friends explains Elinor's strange need each summer  to escape to England in order to write in the very towns where  Horace Wylie had taught her about art.  Not only do characters and events of Jennifer Lorn force  comparisons with her life; its language was very close to her.  Her first words to Benet about its inception were: "I have found  a certain way to write, and I don't know where it comes from.  Do you think it can be a throw-back to some remote ancestor?"  Benet explains, "She had not so much adopted an eighteenth  century manner as found it deeply interwoven in the fabric of  her mind."8  But whether read as historical novel, satire, or allegory of her  life, the book was successful. Sinclair Lewis cabled from Europe,  "At last, a civilized American novel!" Carl Van Vechten led a  torchlight parade down the streets of New York to celebrate  its publication. And sales were surprisingly good, paving the  way (with gold) for the publisher's eager acceptance of her  second novel.  That was Venetian Glass Nephew, again with an eighteenth  Century setting, this time in the Italy of art, religion, and magic.  The good Cardinal Peter Innocent Bon asks of his old age only  to have a nephew to alleviate his loneliness. Through the efforts  of Chastleneuf (Casanova) and an evil glass blower, Luna, a  glass nephew, Virginio, is created, then vivified. He needs, of  course, a wife, and is married to Rosalba, the natural daughter  •  23 	asu06600000180029001							40105330 Bytes	3897	5724	2341851850	RGB	8	600	asu06600000180029001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/734	734	735.jp2	/asu0660/image/735.jp2

They are fond of each other, but their  marriage is certain to fail, given his rigid glass body and her  warm flesh. Rosalba tries first to die in a fire, then agrees to  be transmuted by means of that fire into porcelain herself.  Elinor Wylie felt that she had undergone the same kind of  transmutation, a kind of purification through emotional pain.  In a poem called "Epitaph" she wrote of herself:  In coldest crucibles of pain  Her shrinking flesh was fired  And smoothed into a finer grain  To make it more desired.  Pain left her lips more clear than glass;  It coloured and cooled her hand.  She lay a field of scented grass  Yielded as pasture land.  For this her loveliness was curved  And carved as silver is:  For this she was brave: but she deserved  A better grave than this.9  In other ways Elinor Wylie resembles Rosalba. Most observers  described the author much as Rosalba appeared after her ordeal:  There was about her an air of perfect calm; she was poised,  composed, and quiet, yet without stiffness; her attitude had the  grace of a bird arrested in flight, a flower flexible, but unmoved by wind.10  The Cardinal is pleased by the change. He "knew instinctively  that her spirit was unstirred by any pang that may not be suffered by an exemplary child of seven." This is among the  lightest of the book's ironic observations that those who seem  most innocent and pious, like Cardinal Innocent, can unin-  telligently cause much evil, and those who seem corrupt, like  Chastleneuf, can know the meaning of the greatest good. Thus,  her allegory serves not only as comparison between art and  Nature, again, but also as an attack on the society she so  despised.  Implicit in this theme is a criticism of her earlier attitude  toward poetry. The most frequent theme of the poems in Nets  to Catch the Wind had been the beauty of the passionless  world of art, stated in the popular poems, "Wild Peaches,"  •  24 	asu06600000180030001							40410822 Bytes	3899	5743	3227312353	RGB	8	600	asu06600000180030001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/735	735	736.jp2	/asu0660/image/736.jp2
Elinor Wylie's Novels, Allegories of Love					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000018	"Winter Sleep," and "Velvet Shoes." Such poems earned for her  a reputation as a brilliant, emotionless craftsman. The novels,  however, suggest that she regretted the circumstances that made  her art so calm. With the next two volumes of poetry, Black  Armour and Trivial Breath, she moved quickly toward a more  personal, less reserved expression.  Two further prose works helped to carry forward her exploration of herself. The Orphan Angel is again a novel of  the eighteenth century. The narrative tells of the rescue of  Shelley during the storm which sank his boat. He is brought to  America, where his European elegance is tested by the hardships of life in the wilderness. Most critics recognize that this  is not a story about America, but most fail to see that it is  not a story about Shelley, either. Although Elinor Wylie's so-  called Shelley obsession is well known, and her longstanding  identification with him as a poet, as a thinker, as an authentic  human being, becomes total in The Orphan Angel, he is only  a part of the subject of this novel. The real subject is Elinor  Wylie herself. Not only is she the aristocratic Shiloh, the Shel-  leyan figure, she is every major character in the book. Davy  Butternut, the simple American who serves as Shiloh's companion, is the most important of these. She had always insisted  that, in spite of her many years abroad, one part of her was  rooted in her family's New England past. She talked often  about her homsespun side, and in "Wild Peaches" she wrote  about the "Puritan marrow of my bones." Davy Butternut is  all of these elements in her nature. In addition, she was gradually  abandoning the baroque language of her earlier works. Dialogue  between Shiloh and Davy demonstrates the extremes of language  possible in the Wylie novels. Neither form of speech is close  to anything a living person would use.  Shiloh's is formal speech filled with erudite references: "The  principle of virtual velocities employed by Lagrange to elucidate  his theory of the libration of the moon . . ."n His criticism of  Davy's language brings a reply in the American idion:  Hold your infernal hush, you blasted son of a gun. Language,  is it?

You're a pretty one so talk about language now; you  could be took up anywhere and jailed for most of the verbs  you uses in an hour.12  The tastes of the two men in food, clothing, recreation, even  women, are, similiarly, on opposite ends of the scale, showing  the polarities of Elinor Wylie's personality. The women Shiloh  and Davy meet on their trek across the continent are also facets  of Elinor Wylie's personality: the very young, naive Melissa  Dangerfield, whom they rescue from an unsuitable life with her  father; Rosalie Lillie, a frontier bluestocking, who represents  what the young Miss Hoyt of Washington society might have  become, the lovely Anne, daughter of missionaries, who becomes an Indian princess; and finally Silver Cross, who is a  symbol of Platonic intellectual beauty. Many critics think she  is the soul sister Shelley sought and finally found through  Elinor Wylie's intercession. But Shiloh rejects Silver Cross, in  fact, after he has found her, as the author herself was rejecting  the purely intellectual life. She advised in "The Minotaur,"  written during this period:  Go study to disdain  The frail, the over-fine  Which tapers to a line  Knotted about the brain.  This only is the cure,  To clasp the creature fast;  The flesh survives at last  Because it is not pure.13  She made her meaning even more specific in terms of The  Orphan Angel when she wrote to a friend, "As a matter of  fact, Shiloh went back to Anne, but this is too dear a secret  to be divulged to the many." To the same correspondent she  revealed how immediate the problems of this novel were to her:  When I wrote my Angel, I built up a world so real to me and  so desirable that I have never been able to escape from it since,  into any sort of conceit with the present. I lived in it too long,  and now I don't feel at home in what is reality.14  She did not want reality enough to try to capture it in her final  novel, Mr. Hodge and Mr. Hazard. In that book, she brought  back to life not just one poet, but a composite of many poets  of the Romantic age, in the person of Mr. Hazard, a poetic  • 26 	asu06600000180032001							38595130 Bytes	3870	5694	2172851561	RGB	8	600	asu06600000180032001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/737	737	738.jp2	/asu0660/image/738.jp2
Elinor Wylie's Novels, Allegories of Love					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000018	failure as the author declared herself to be. Mr. Hazard's attraction to the two daughters of Clara Hunting, Allegra and Rosa,  again reveals two sides of Elinor Wylie's nature. Further, this  novel, like The Orphan Angel, traces the progress of its creator's  language:  Mr. Hazard's hair had been changing from bronze into silver,  the virgin gold of his heart had been mixed with a sad alloy.  If a heart is open, iron may very easily enter it, to alter the first  purity of its metal.15  Elinor Wylie became very fond of "poor Mr. Hazard" as she  described him in her letters. There is no doubt that he is the  author herself, since she made the statement in an interview  for the New York Sun shortly before her death. And Benet  notes that she characterized the whole of her life in one paragraph in that book:  Now Hazard's own mind bloomed with auguries; it was spring,  the jocund freshness of a morning to which high summer will  succeed as noon. The autumnal evening of such a time could  not fail to be a harvest of contentment. Only good luck could  grow in such a land and such a season. Some devil had sown  tares in the garden he had sought to plant in this green valley,  but his impatience had despaired too soon, he had let an army  of wretched weeds drive him out of his inheritance. He had  been infantile in his swift despair; he had never lacked courage,  but he had lacked fidelity and that careless trust in his own  powers which is worth more to a man than the affection of  families and the approval of publics. He should have forgotten  his gibbering peers; he should have ignored the brute commonalty. He should have let the world run softly by, as the  Thames ran softly between water-meadows, until all his songs  were ended.16  Images of death appear frequently in this novel, as in her  final book of poems, Angels and Earthly Creatures. But something more significant occurs in that final volume. With the  nineteen sonnets called "One Person" her work arrives at that  expression of herself which she had explored in her four novels.  "This miracle," as she calls it, of falling in love unexpectedly  produced these poems which have been compared with all the  great sonnet sequences. Prepared for publication the night she  died, they are a fitting final achievement for a poet who struggled  so hard to find her individual voice. "Such a spirit," Edmund  Wilson said, "among human beings can nowhere find itself  •  27 	asu06600000180033001							39737842 Bytes	3823	5704	4041309979	RGB	8	600	asu06600000180033001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/738	738	739.jp2	/asu0660/image/739.jp2

Received in the conventional world with aversion,  suspicion, and fear, it creates in that other world where people  avowedly live by their wits and their imaginations, an embarrassment almost equally uncomfortable."17 Elinor Wylie managed to face both worlds with courage and integrity. A stanza  from "Let No Charitable Hope" shows her strength:  In masks outrageous and austere  The years go by in single file;  But none has merited my fear,  And none has quite escaped my smile.18  Notes — Elinor Wylie  Elinor Wylie, Collected Prose (New York, 1934), p. 879.  2Undated clipping in the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript  Library at Yale University.  3Nancy Hoyt, Elinor Wylies Portrait of an Unknown Lady  (Indianapolis and New York, 1935), p. 27.  4This is Henry Seidel Canby's phrase from American Memoir  (Boston, 1947).  5Edna St. Vincent Millay, Letters.

Recent Gifts and Acquisitions																																asu0660000018	Recent Gifts and Acquisitions  It is not at all surprising that of the most significant additions to the  Library's collections in the past three or four years many were nearly or  completely unattainable just a short time earlier. One development in the  field of publishing has placed research materials within the reach of  libraries whose history covers only a few decades in the twentieth  century; the reprinting efforts of many publishing houses have contributed  titles that until lately could be found only in the older academic institutions and in private collections, whose combined resources could not  begin to satisfy the needs of the nineteen-fifties, let alone the future.  Johnson, Kraus, Burt Franklin, Benjamin Blom, and Gregg are a representative few of such reprint publishers.  Another development—or perhaps here trend is the better word—that  has permitted libraries like our own to afford to our readers the possibilities for serious and broad research is the printing in book form of catalogues of important collections. Some of these publications have been the  work of the academic institution of which the collection is a part, others  have been printed by private publishers.

Chinese Historiography					Knoblock, John																											asu0660000019	THE  CARRE LL  Volume 10 June, 1969 Number 1  Chinese Historiography  John H. Knoblock  IN MOST AREAS of historical scholarship the major problems which the scholar faces result from lack of adequate  records and sources with which to reconstruct the period,  interpret the text, or understand the purport of the argument.  This is not the case in Chinese history, literature and philosophy.  There is rarely a shortage of materials for any period. Indeed,  it is the sheer mass of the sources which overwhelms the scholar  and presents him with virtually insuperable difficulties in locating and utilizing them. Several factors explain this unusual  situation. First there is the long tradition of Chinese scholarship  and the high regard, even veneration, of literacy and writing.  It was expected that a scholar would have total command of  the materials in his subject; he would thus know by memory  the major texts in his field and would naturally recognize an  allusion or quotation.  Though this high ideal was never fully realizable, it does  account for some of the major difficulties of Chinese scholarship:  the lack of identification of sources and quotations; the absence  of indices, punctuation, and other aids to clarify difficult passages. A related problem is the absence of systematic organization of materials. The contents of a work reflect the interest of  the scholar and not any logical or subject divisions corresponding to those common in the West since the departmentalization  of knowledge. The result is that one can obtain no clear idea  of the contents of a large work or know where to look for  information on a given topic unless he is familiar with the  sources at first hand. 	asu06600000190003001							65849944 Bytes	3848	5702	2455614755	RGB	8	600	asu06600000190003001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/749	749	750.jp2	/asu0660/image/750.jp2
Chinese Historiography					Knoblock, John																											asu0660000019	A major aim of modern scholarship is indexing the major  classical texts, encyclopedias, and collections. A first step in  this direction was made in the 1930's by the Harvard-Yenching  Institute Index Series (which the University of Miami Library  possesses), in the 1940's by the Centre franco-chinois d'etudes  sinqlogiques Index Series, and currently by the major index  project of the Research Institute of Far Eastern Studies of Chung  Chi College, Hong Kong, and by a number of Japanese institutions. Despite all the progress, the program outlined by Arthur  W. Hummel, Emeritus Curator of the East Asian Collection  of the Library of Congress, in 1929 remains to be fulfilled. This  program called for:  classified indexes of all the places, names, and facts recorded  in the dynastic histories; we need to facilitate the processes of  finding words in dictionaries, articles in encyclopedias, and  books in libraries; and all the standard literature needs to be  repunctuated, the texts collated, and difficult passages annotated  in colloquial style.  Substantial progress has been made in the fields of philosophy  and literature in preparing punctuated editions of the basic  texts and, recently, on the mainland, editions of the first four  dynastic histories have been prepared with full punctuation and  detailed annotations presented in Western-style footnotes.  The second factor which, in part, accounts for the abundance  of materials is the early invention of paper. Paper was invented  in A.D. 105 by the eunuch official Ts'ai Lun who discovered  tree bark, old rags, and fishing nets could be employed to make  paper suitable for writing. Prior to his time, bamboo strips and  silk had been employed for writing and books were either composed of strips of bamboo bound together with hemp cords or  leather thongs, though sometimes with silk ribbons, to form units  called "p'ien" or sections. Manuscripts written on long pieces  of silk were formed into "chiian" or rolls. The divisions of ancient texts are called today "p'ien" or "chiian" reflecting the  older forms of binding. Both types had obvious disadvantages.  The dynastic history, recording the invention, notes:  In ancient times writings and inscriptions were generally  made on tablets of bamboo or on pieces of silk. But since silk  was costly and bamboo was heavy, they were not convenient  s 	asu06600000190004001							65561864 Bytes	3830	5704	3222512163	RGB	8	600	asu06600000190004001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/750	750	751.jp2	/asu0660/image/751.jp2
Chinese Historiography					Knoblock, John																											asu0660000019	to use. Ts'ai Lun then initiated the idea of making writing  material from the bark of trees, hemp, old rags and fishing nets.  He submitted a report on the process to the emperor in the first  year of the Yuan-hsing reign-period (A.D. 105) and was  praised for his ability. From this time, paper has been in use  everywhere and is universally called the "paper of Lord Ts'ai."  Though substances which were probably quasi-paper were invented as early as 76 B.C., it was not until Ts'ai Lun that the  technique was perfected. The bulkiness of books written on  bamboo strips which, at this time, were about 23 cm. long and  1.3 cm. wide, and were bound into bundles spreading out over  about 122 cm., can be easily seen. Further, with use and from  weathering, the hemp cords and leather thongs often deteriorated or broke and the bamboo strips fell into disarray, accounting  for some of the most severe problems of textual criticism. Silk,  on the other hand, was convenient and usable. Large amounts  of text could be recorded on a roll which took up relatively  little space and which was light. Though it did not cost, as in  Rome of this period, more than its weight in gold, unfortunately  silk was quite expensive. Paper had the advantage of being  cheaper than silk and more convenient than bamboo. It therefore rapidly came to be universally used for writing, even for  important documents. The earliest paper manuscripts date from  A.D. 109 and were found near Chu-yen in western China. Within a century and a half paper had spread through East Asia,  so that the dynastic history observes "from this time, paper has  been in use everywhere." By the third century, different types  of paper had come into use and calligraphers praised some types  for their special aesthetic qualities and usefulness. By the end  of the third century, paper had become the favorite medium of  men of letters and even scented "honey-fragrance paper" was  used for special occasions.  The result was a transference of manuscripts from silk and  bamboo to paper. This was, however, far from being an unqualified blessing. Bernhard Karlgern, an eminent Swedish  sinologist, contends that the invention of paper was a misfortune  because it is so perishable. Indeed, until the invention of printing  some six centuries later, there was no means of duplicating  texts except by hand and manuscripts of paper were more perish-  -.3 	asu06600000190005001							65153188 Bytes	3822	5680	1804957882	RGB	8	600	asu06600000190005001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/751	751	752.jp2	/asu0660/image/752.jp2

Nonetheless,  once printing had been invented, paper made possible the inexpensive duplication and dissemination of texts, the multiplication of libraries, and the consequent preservation of large  numbers of medieval editions of ancient texts.  Printing, then, is the third factor which accounts for the  abundance of Chinese texts. Though printing did not become  widespread until the Sung dynasty, the basic techniques involved had been known for several centuries. Since the use of  stone and bronze seals and inscriptions, dating from the fifth  century B.C. or earlier, rubbings of stone inscriptions had been  common. Of particular importance in this regard was the decision in the Han dynasty to "collate and standardize the text  of the Six Classics" and to engrave them on stones so that they  might be a permanent and standard text. Scholars, anxious to  obtain the correct texts, would often make rubbings of these  stones. These tablets were completed in A.D. 183, but during  the turmoil of the Age of Disunity (220-586) they were lost  so that by the Sui Dynasty (568-618), less than one-tenth  remained. The impetus which these standard texts gave to the  demand for copies and the readily available technique of rubbing seem to have been the background to the invention of  printing.  When actual printing began is, however, unknown. The  earliest mention of the technique dates from 593 when the  Sui Emperor Wen ordered that Buddhist scriptures and images  should be printed, but the process was then certainly in a  rudimentary stage. The first use of printing thus seems to have  been to make inexpensive copies of prayers and charms for use  of the Buddhist laity. The earliest surviving printed document  is such a charm and dates to 764. By the end of the ninth  century, printing had become relatively more common. The  world's oldest printed book is the Diamond Sutra, printed in  868 and now on display in the British Museum. From 877 and  882 we possess printed calendars and from about 900 we possess  a fragmentary dictionary and two other Buddhist works. A  Chinese official, writing in 883, mentions a number of printed  s 	asu06600000190006001							66526808 Bytes	3860	5743	434213739	RGB	8	600	asu06600000190006001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/752	752	753.jp2	/asu0660/image/753.jp2

In 932 the Imperial  authorities decided to print the Confucian Classics and during  the next twenty-one years officials of the National Academy  labored on the work which was printed in 130 volumes. Between  972 and 983 the vast Buddhist Tripitaka was printed in 5048  volumes which had found their way to Japan by 985 and to  Korea by 991. The Taoist Patrologia was printed in 4565  volumes and presented to the throne in 1019. The earliest private  edition dates to 953 when one Ho Ling printed several hundred  copies of his own poetry and graciously presented them to his  friends, relatives, and associates.  It is, however, not only printed editions from the relatively  recent Sung dynasty (960-1274) that account for the vastness  of Chinese source materials. At the oasis of Tun-huang in  western China, a find of 21,000 manuscripts dating from 406  to about 1000, all from a single monastic library, was made in  March of 1907 by the British explorer, Sir Auriel Stein. Stein  obtained more than 7000 manuscripts from this library and  deposited them in the British Museum. These are the most  perfectly preserved specimens. Later, in December of the same  year, the eminent French sinologist Paul Pelliot obtained an  additional 5000 manuscripts, 3000 of which were sent to Paris  and 2000 to the Chinese National Academy. These are generally  considered the most important manuscripts for scholary studies.  Some 400 manuscripts were sent to Japan and 2000 more found  their way into private collections. In 1910 the remainder of the  21,000 manuscripts were obtained by the Chinese government.  These manuscripts constitute an invaluable collection of contemporary sources. These discoveries have been supplemented  by even earlier discoveries of bamboo books and wooden tablets  from the oasis communities of western China, some dating from  as early as the second century B.C. Even earlier is a unique silk  manuscript found at Ch'ang-sha and dating from the fourth  century B.C. More ancient still are inscriptions from bronze  vessels cast to commemorate important occasions and record  important documents. These date from about 1100 to 400 B.C.  The texts of these bronze inscriptions have been collected by  epigraphers since the Sung dynasty and a critical edition of 	asu06600000190007001							65922764 Bytes	3843	5716	1450640969	RGB	8	600	asu06600000190007001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/753	753	754.jp2	/asu0660/image/754.jp2

Still earlier are the oracle bone inscriptions which date from  1300 to 1000 B.C. and were first brought to the attention of  archaeologists in 1898. At that time they were thought by the  peasants of Honan, who had discovered caches of them, to be  dragon bones and were powdered and dispensed by local  apothecaries as an essential ingredient, along with rhinocerous  horn and other exotica, in the aphrodisiacs. The oracle bone  inscriptions are short statements inquiring about the future  written on the plastrons of tortoises. A hot instrument was applied to the bone, causing it to crack. The relation of the cracks  to the inscription gave the diviner the answer to the inquiry.  Sometimes the inscriptions include an exact date, the name of  the diviner, the name of the King for whom the divination was  made, the names of other persons, and other items of interest  to the historian, but there are no connected narratives or records.  Since 1898, scholars have collected the bones and used them to  reconstruct many facets of the life and culture of the Shang  Dynasty. To date, more than 41,000 oracle bone inscriptions  have been published. Despite a great effort on the part of  scholars, the oracle bone inscriptions have not provided the  amount of information about the Shang period that their sheer  number alone would have suggested. Further archaeological  discoveries, when the vagaries of the Great Cultural Proletarian  Revolution permit resumption of serious scholarship, will certainly enrich our understanding of China and enlarge the rich  contemporary resources beyond those we already possess.  It is difficult to grasp the abundance of Chinese sources without some concrete illustrations. Many Chinese works are published in large collections of material, arranged traditionally in  several categories, usually four: Classics, History, Philosophy,  and Literature. Philosophy typically contains works which might  better be called scientific, medical, philological or literary. The  other categories more nearly approximate Western expectations.  One such collection, which our Library possesses, is the Ssu-pu  pei-yao, Essential Writings in Four Divisions. The following  table summarizes the relevant statistics:  S 	asu06600000190008001							66779128 Bytes	3888	5723	2127311086	RGB	8	600	asu06600000190008001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/754	754	755.jp2	/asu0660/image/755.jp2

This estimate is perhaps low, since a page of notes consists of 520 characters  while of one of text is 260 characters.)  Other major collections, which form the core of most Chinese  libraries, are Ssu-pu ts'ung-k'an in 321 titles, Ts'ung-shu chi-  cheng chien-pien in 1026 titles, Wan-yu wen-k'u in 480 titles,  and Kuchhsiieh chi-k'an in 260 titles. Efforts are being made to  obtain these for our library.  Bibliographical studies have prospered in China since the  Han Dynasty when the father and son team, Liu Hsiang and  Liu Hsin, prepared editions of the texts for the Imperial Library  and wrote a detailed catalogue of its contents with each book  classified according to contents and a brief note made about  each author. This catalogue (7 B.C.) survives in the dynastic  history of the Han dynasty, the Han Shu of Pan Ku. It lists 677  works in 11,332 sections (p'ien) by 625 authors. During the  centuries which followed efforts were made to find additional  ancient works and contemporary scholars produced numerous  studies on the classics as well as original works, so that in the  middle of the third century A.D., the Keeper of the Imperial Archives drew up a catalogue of the Library which listed some  29,945 rolls (chiian), a rather significant increase. Turmoil during the Age of Disunity destroyed large numbers of ancient  works and when, in 432, the Keeper of the Imperial Archives  prepared a new catalogue, it listed only 4,582 rolls. At the  beginning of the sixth century, efforts were made to recover  lost books as well as obtain new works.

Books which had been copied on paper in ink were  often found to be defective and a team of expert calligraphers  prepared new versions. The results of their labors are recorded  in another complete catalogue which survives as a part of the  History of the Sui Dynasty. This work lists some 17,000 titles.  By the middle of the eighth century, the climax of the brilliant  T'ang dynasty, the Imperial Collection included 53,951 books  and a collection of "contemporary authors" containing 28,469  books. Shortly after this time, as we have seen, printing became  common with an enormous increase in the number of books.  In the year 1406, we are informed that there were more than  300,000 printed books in the Imperial Library and double that  number of manuscript editions. This enormous mass of material  was seen to overwhelm the scholar and efforts were made to  make the essential information on any given topic more readily  available. In 1407 the Yung-lo Emperor appointed a committee  of 2,316 scholars to collect in one work the substance of all  works hitherto published. This work was described in the Report  of the Librarian of Congress, 1923, as "a universal compendium  of all existing Chinese history, ethics, science, industry, art,  geography, administration, religion, divination, in a word, of  all human knowledge among the Chinese up to 1400 A.D."  When the work was completed in early 1408, it consisted of  11,095 volumes containing 22,877 chapters with the table of  contents alone occupying some 60 chapters. The work quoted  extensively from earlier sources, sometimes quoting whole sections or even entire works, which had been gathered from all  over the empire, copied, and returned to their owners. The work  was entitled the Yung-lo Encyclopedia, after the title of the  Emperor's reign period. When the draft was presented to the  throne, orders were given for it to be prepared for publication  and a copy was prepared, but calculation showed that to publish  the work would be prohibitively expensive and the project was  abandoned. Later two additional copies were made and placed  in libraries at Peking, while the original was housed in Nanking.  •  8  -&gt; 	asu06600000190010001							66775920 Bytes	3903	5701	2627524207	RGB	8	600	asu06600000190010001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/756	756	757.jp2	/asu0660/image/757.jp2
Chinese Historiography					Knoblock, John																											asu0660000019	In the disturbances associated with the end of the Ming dynasty,  two copies were destroyed and 2,422 chapters of the third were  missing. Subsequently during the looting of "barbarian" armies  from the West in 1860 and the destruction of the Yuan Ming  Yuan palace during the Boxer Rebellion (1901), all but 368  volumes were destroyed and these were scattered throughout  the world. The work has recently been printed and it is of  considerable value because it contains 385 ancient and rare  works which are not otherwise preserved.  Though the Yung-lo Encyclopedia is the largest of such works  in Chinese history, in the Ch'ing dynasty other works of comparable scale were prepared during the reigns of the K'ang-hsi  (1661-1772) and Ch'ien-lung (1736-1795) emperors. Several  of these works are of interest. The K'ang-hsi Emperor, wishing  to rival the reputation of the Yung-lo Emperor as a patron of  learning, sponsored the compilation of a new encyclopedia  entitled A Collection of Books and Illustrations of Ancient and  Modern Times (Ku-chin fu-shu chi-ch'eng), consisting of 32  divisions, 6109 topics, and 10,000 printed Chinese volumes.  This is the largest printed encyclopedia in the world. He also  commissioned the compilation of an exhaustive dictionary, the  K'ang-hsi tzu-tien, which contains 47,021 characters (not counting alternative forms). His grandson, the Ch'ien-lung Emperor,  continued the tradition of patronage and ordered that a collection of all major works on all major subjects, whether printed,  out-of-print, or in manuscript, be prepared. The results took  nine years to complete (1773-1786). The collection was entitled Complete Library of the Four Treasuries (Ssu-k'u cKiXan-  shu) contained 3461 works in 93,456 chapters. Each work  adjudged to be important was prefaced by a long descriptive  introduction which gave the nature of the work, a summary,  indications of the work's strengths and weaknesses, and a brief  biography of the author the first time he appears. These annotations are generally considered masterpieces of conciseness and  critical judgment. Seven copies of the work were prepared, and  housed in specially built libraries which, in the south, were open  to the general public. A catalogue of this work includes an  additional 6793 works which were extant at the time of the 	asu06600000190011001							66919320 Bytes	3888	5735	1150061179	RGB	8	600	asu06600000190011001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/757	757	758.jp2	/asu0660/image/758.jp2

Though this undertaking was a major contribution to scholarship, it masks one of  the most unfortunate occurrences in Chinese history, the literary  inquisition of the Ch'ien-lung Emperor. In the process of searching for works for consideration and in reviewing their contents,  the committee took an opportunity to suppress or edit works  which were seditious, critical or simply "trivial" or "nonsense."  The Emperor decreed that "None may remain for later generations in order that our speech is cleansed and the hearts of men  are made straight." In a veritable house-to-house search, the  committee destroyed 2300 works and censured another 350  works. Works which criticized the "foreign" Manchu dynasty,  even in mild terms, were suppressed and destroyed. This prohibition was extended to works from earlier dynasties which  criticized the "foreign" dynasties which were considered ante-  cedant to the Manchus. Considerable arbitrariness was exhibited  on the part of officials in labeling works to be "trivial" or  "nonsense." One official noted that "although there is no evidence of treason in this work, the content, nonetheless, are  frequently nonsensical and fishing for praise. It should be burned." So thorough were the efforts of these scholars that in later  years all memory of the literary inquisition was lost and was  reconstructed only by later scholars. In his attempt to destroy  the intellectual foundations of opposition to his dynasty, Ch'ien-  lung proved himself astute and in later times many Chinese  favored the Manchu dynasty and regarded it as their own.  In 1704 the K'ang-hsi Emperor ordered the preparation of a  phrase dictionary, the P'ei-wen Yun-fu in which any important  word or phrase can be traced to its source and its uses in  classical literature clearly indicated. Another collection of great  significance to scholarship in the Classics, is the collected criticism of the Ch'ing scholars edited and compiled by Yen Chieh  under the patronage of Juan Yuan in 1829. This work, consisting of 1400 chapters, contains the works of more than 180  Ch'ing scholars dealing with the Classics. A continuation of the  work was published in 1888 by Wang Hsien-ch'ien and included  an additional 1430 chapters comprising 59,372 pages. Other  major collectanea were compiled in the Ch'ing dynasty and they  •  10  S: 	asu06600000190012001							67224032 Bytes	3910	5729	127177772	RGB	8	600	asu06600000190012001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/758	758	759.jp2	/asu0660/image/759.jp2

These listings may give some indication of the abundance of  Chinese works, but they do not give an adequate impression of  the difficulties encountered in cataloging and utilizing these  sources. No truly adequate system exists for dealing with collections of Chinese source materials. The rather general categories used in large collections or as topic headings of encyclopedias are entirely inadequate and cannot be employed. But  those developed for use in Western libraries for Western  language materials are not appropriate either. The result has  been that virtually all major libraries in the country have established special libraries for East Asian materials and utilize a  different system of cataloging for these works. Special problems  exist in the use of large reprint collections, such as Ssu-pu  pei-yao and other ts'ung-shu which, in most libraries, are catalogued as a single unit. Efforts are underway at the Library of  Congress to prepare a Chinese Union Catalogue which ultimately will be published in book form. In a recent special  project of cataloging, the Library was able to accumulate approximately 280,000 reports of which 110,000 were completely  alphabetized and the remaining 170,000 were arranged by at  least the first word of the entry, though, in some cases, further.  This project will require years and will vastly simplify many  problems.  A related problem is that of cataloging single titles in some  appropriate subject heading. Because until recent times there  was no departmentalization of knowledge comparable to that  characteristic of the West for some centuries, the contents of  books tend to combine materials not traditionally related in  the West, which poses a number of problems. Further in traditional scholarship works are normally cited by title rather than  author. Many works are written by one scholar, edited by  another, and published under the auspices of yet another. In  references there is, accordingly, some confusion as to whom  the work ought to be attributed. Thus the Huang-ch'ing ching-  chieh was published under the auspices of Juan Yuan who is  often listed as the editor, though in fact he merely subsidized  •  11 	asu06600000190013001							66044340 Bytes	3840	5731	3385748192	RGB	8	600	asu06600000190013001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/759	759	760.jp2	/asu0660/image/760.jp2
Chinese Historiography					Knoblock, John																											asu0660000019	the undertaking. It was edited by Yen Chieh and includes the  works of more than 180 scholars. Other works were prepared  under the direction of numerous scholars, including several  different chief editors, none of whom considered the authors  by Chinese scholars who frequently indicate the actual author  of the section in question. Locating a work is thus quite difficult.  First, there may be doubt concerning the title; secondly, some  question may exist as to who the actual author is; thirdly, the  chief editor of collectanea is often open to question; and fourthly,  such works are normally included in large collections of reprints  (ts'ung-shu) which pose some difficulties in attempting to determine in which reprint series a given title is included. For  these reasons, titles tend to be more important than nominal  editors or authors, ts'ung-shu collections need to be examined  as a unit by the scholar who must become generally familiar  with their contents, and the multiple editions of single works  and their relative merits must be determined from the numerous  bibliographic catalogues which often employ criteria inconsistent  with modern scholarly requirements (e.g. Confucian orthodoxy).  More specialized problems of scholarship can best be illustrated by a single discipline, but the problems are characteristic of  almost all areas of scholarship in greater or lesser degrees. In  historical studies, a major problem which the novice and scholar  both face is confusion of Chinese names. During his lifetime a  Chinese scholar or notable may acquire as many as five different  names and after his death two more may be added. Thus Sun  Yat-sen is known in America by the Cantonese pronunciation  of his "courtesy name." In China, however, he is usually referred to by his "book" name, received upon entering school,  Sun Wen or by an alternative "courtesy" name, Sun Chung-shan.  Had posthumous titles not been abolished with the founding of  the Republic, he would undoubtedly have acquired additional  names. Secondly, the number of surnames in China is considerably smaller than in the West. A tenth century work on surnames  lists 408 common monosyllabic and 30 disyllabic surnames, but  in romanization, some 28 of these are written Chi and 28 are  written CKi, which, to the novice at least, are easily confused.  The result of the small number of surnames is that persons of  •   12 	asu06600000190014001							66325864 Bytes	3867	5715	1728280748	RGB	8	600	asu06600000190014001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/760	760	761.jp2	/asu0660/image/761.jp2
Chinese Historiography					Knoblock, John																											asu0660000019	very different periods may have the same name. Analogous  difficulties exist in the methods of referring to rulers. An emperor  may be referred to by his personal name, as in the case of the  founder of the Ming dynasty, Chu Yuan-chang. He has a  courtesy name Kuo-jui, but he is often referred to by the title  of his reign (nien-hao), thus the Hung-wu Emperor. After his  death he receives a posthumous name, Hsiao-k'ang and a temple  name T'ai-tsu. Further difficulties exist in the use of geographical  names. First there are a number of transcriptions of the names  according to the various systems. Thus Peking, may be Peiching,  Beijing, or, using an alternative form, Peiping Beiping, Peip'ing.  The non-alphabetic character of the Chinese language means  that there is no uniformly adopted way of indexing. It may be  done by topic, by the system of rhymes (which must be memorized and includes at least 76 rhyme characters), by the  system of 214 radicals, by the number of strokes contained in  each character, by the "four corner system" which analyzes  the character, or by the romanization according to one of five  different systems. No one system is universally employed and a  student must eventually master all these methods as well as the  systems of transcription.  Chinese scholars, in the attempt to appear learned, usually  packed their writings with numerous literary allusions which,  if taken literally or not recognized, will lead to serious errors.  The statement that the inhabitants of a certain district were  reduced to eating their children, may mean nothing more than  that there was a severe famine. The hyperbole was intended to  suggest the severity, not to describe the actual occurrence.  Similarly, a heavy snow in June means that an unjust act has  been committed or "three moves" is indicative of concern for  one's offspring's proper upbringing. The first refers to the unjust  imprisonment of the philosopher Tsou Yen by King Hui in the  fourth century B.C., the second to the three moves which  Mencius' mother made to make sure he would grow up in a  suitable environment.  Chinese scholars have no clear, linear method of indicating  dates, so the exact dating of an event is often difficult and always  tedious. But Chinese writers sometimes give not more than the  •   13 	asu06600000190015001							66259912 Bytes	3862	5717	2927706514	RGB	8	600	asu06600000190015001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/761	761	762.jp2	/asu0660/image/762.jp2
Chinese Historiography					Knoblock, John																											asu0660000019	barest indication of dating or do not include sufficient information to make an easy conversion to the Western calendar.  Further there is the habit referent to the age of a person "in his  xth year." Thus a child, at birth, in his first year. Persons not  understanding this convention, suggest that the Chinese consider  a child to be a year old at birth, but all that is meant is that he  is in his first year of life. When he celebrates his "first" birthday,  he has entered his second year of life and would be said to be  "in his second year" by the Chinese, though we would say he  was "one year old."  The long tradition of scholarship is responsible for an enormous literature even in a specialized field apart from the  enormous compilations. A survey of historical works dating  from 589 to 1911 shows 137,162 Chinese volumes. These  sources are often incomplete, from a modern point of view.  Histories generally were compiled by the Confucian bureaucracy  and show all of its prejudices. Buddhism, and, to a lesser extent,  Taoism are simply neglected or ignored. Literature other than  the classical is often omitted. Parties and social groups like  merchants and eunuchs are generally given a highly prejudicial  treatment and "barbarians" and minority peoples are mentioned  only when their customs are particularly "outlandish" or horrifying or when they intrude into Chinese domestic affairs. The  strong humanistic bias of Confusian scholars led to general  neglect of economics, technology, science and mathematics. To  some extent these deficiencies can be overcome by recourse to  other sources, but they give the unwary student a very incomplete picture of Chinese life, history, and culture.  Other features of Chinese scholarship do not accord with  western standards. Chinese scholars always carefully examined  the past. When sources were divergent, they examined them,  decided which one was correct, and suppressed divergent accounts. Interpretations were considered subjective, therefore the  narration was confined to selections of documents and purely  factual accounts. Such comment as was allowed was appended  to a final "eulogy" or "evaluation" of the person. Because history  was considered most objective when it was confined to documentary records, Chinese histories are normally compilations  •  14 	asu06600000190016001							66490832 Bytes	3868	5728	2225484102	RGB	8	600	asu06600000190016001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/762	762	763.jp2	/asu0660/image/763.jp2
Chinese Historiography					Knoblock, John																											asu0660000019	of documents edited and pieced together to form a coherent  narrative. Unfortunately only exceptionally are sources clearly  indicated, and since there is no punctuation, direct quotation  is sometimes difficult to determine. Further, since commentaries  were written directly after the sentence or word which they explained, they often, through later mis-copying or mis-interpretation, found their way into the text. Nonetheless, critical scholarship of the Ch'ing dynasty was a model of precision, careful  investigations, and scrupulous fidelity to established texts.  In stressing the difficulties, the many virtues and the richness  of Chinese texts have been neglected. Taken together they confront the scholar with the richest collection of materials on the  life and development of a major civilization in existence. The  period of the Spring and Autumn Annals (722-489 B.C.) is  more richly recorded than is that period in any other part of the  world. For the later periods we have only begun to grasp the  overwhelming sources at our disposal. Complaint comes not  from deficiencies so much as from abundance. Were the resources fewer, many of our problems would be less critical.  Building a library adequate to permit research into the great  traditions of China and into the present revolution and turmoil  is now underway at the University of Miami. The first steps have  been taken, but much remains to be done. During the last year  the holdings of the library have increased almost ten times, so  that today the Library possesses some twenty ts'ung-shu sets,  including Wan-yu wen-k'u, Ssu-pu pei-yao, Ssu-pu ts'ung-k'an,  and Ts'ung-shu chi-cheng, the complete history of the Ch'ing  dynasty, the monumental Ch'ing shih-lu, and several thousand  individual titles, for a total of about 6,700 titles and 15,000  items. These Chinese language sources are supplemented by 269  Chinese language periodicals, 67 Japanese language periodicals,  375 Japanese language monographs, 100 Western language  periodicals and more than 5,000 titles in Western languages  (excluding Russian) directly relating to China. These purchases  are enough to rank the Library about 15th in the nation in  holdings, but they are not enough to place Miami among the  great institutions, which have libraries of as many as 300,000  Chinese books. Nonetheless a very significant beginning has  •   15 	asu06600000190017001							65339232 Bytes	3817	5704	3747235162	RGB	8	600	asu06600000190017001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/763	763	764.jp2	/asu0660/image/764.jp2

Chinese libraries are  relatively new in this country. The year 1969 is of special significance in this respect, for it is the centennial of the first arrival  of 1,000 Chinese books in 1869. During the next decades we  may expect that Chinese libraries will be a standard part of the  holdings of any library which wishes to be considered major  and wiH be no more exotic and esoteric than Russian sources  are tod?y.  1  16 	asu06600000190018001							66623456 Bytes	3873	5732	4131356312	RGB	8	600	asu06600000190018001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/764	764	765.jp2	/asu0660/image/765.jp2

The Massacre Of Glen Coe					Wellington, James E.																											asu0660000019	The Massacre Of Glen Coe1  James E. Wellington  Oh! tell me, Harper, wherefore flow  Thy wayward notes of wail and woe  Far down the desert of Glen Coe,  Where none may list their melody?  —Scott  ON the first day of January 1692 an old man plodded  wearily through the frozen hills and passes of the Scottish Highlands on his way southward from Fort William  to Inveraray. The winter that year was a Severe one in Scotland,  and he trudged through a bitter, blinding snowstorm. The old  man was Mac Ian of Glen Coe, a descendent of the hereditary  lords of the Isles and of Scottish royalty, leader and patriarch  of his people, chief of Clan Macdonald of Glen Coe; and he  was battling the storm in a desperate effort to meet a deadline.  The deadline had been imposed by King William III of England,  who had succeeded James II (a Stewart of Scottish descent)  after the Whig rebellion of 1688. During that struggle most of  the Scottish clans had remained loyal to the House of Stewart,  as a great many of them had remained loyal to the Crown during  the English Civil War of the 1640's. Clan Macdonald of Glen  Coe had fought side by side with Montrose in the Civil War  and had faced the muskets of Cromwell's New Model Army  with nothing but their bows and arrows. Clan Macdonald had  bled with Dundee at the battle of Killiecrankie in July 1689—  fighting not so much out of devotion to the Stewart cause as  out of enmity to the Campbells of Argyll, who had espoused  the claim of William and Mary, as they had earlier supported  the Covenanters, against the convictions of most loyal Highlanders.  The death of Dundee at Killiecrankie ruined whatever slim  hopes the Highlanders may have cherished of restoring James  and the House of Stewart to the English throne, but they maintained their loyalty to James and secretly kept the hope that  France, locked in war with England at the time, would mount  an invasion led by James on behalf of the Stewart claim.

The Massacre Of Glen Coe					Wellington, James E.																											asu0660000019	dee's army refused to disband, and the clans who had supported  James stubbornly maintained their loyalty to him and their  refusal to accept the accession of William and Mary. William,  in his turn, tried to remove this potential source of danger by  offering pardon to those clans whose chiefs would agree to sign,  before a civil magistrate, an oath of allegiance no later than 1  January 1689 and threatening harsh punishment to those who  refused to take the oath. Several chiefs—men with such ringing  Gaelic names as Glengarry, Keppoch, Appin, and Lochiel—  delayed their signing until all hope of a Jacobite invasion of  Scotland was gone and they should be honorably released by  James from their sworn allegiance to him. Among the last to  capitulate to William was this same Mac Ian, chief of Clan  Macdonald of Glen Coe.  Mac Ian of Glen Coe had presented himself punctually to  Colonel Hill, governor of Fort William, on 31 December 1691,  only to learn that there was no civil magistrate at Fort William  to administer the oath. Hence, despite his tears of entreaty, the  old man was immediately sent southward to Inveraray to make  his deposition before the sheriff of Argyllshire. When he arrived  two days later, after breasting a Highland blizzard, he found  that the sheriff was absent. By the time Mac Ian was finally  permitted to sign his oath to William III, the date was 6 January  1692, six days after the deadline imposed by the Crown. The  sheriff, however, wrote to Colonel Hill at Fort William that Mac  Ian had signed late but under extenuating circumstances and  asked that the Macdonalds of Glen Coe be exempted from punishment. The important thing to remember at this juncture is  that Mac Ian had signed, that he had gone to a great deal of  trouble to affirm in writing the loyalty of himself and his clan  to William HI. But it is also important to remember that the  council at Edinburgh subsequently refused to consider Mac Ian's  case, since technically he had signed late, and deleted his name  from the certificate.  Now, the Macdonalds of Glen Coe had powerful enemies,  both personal and political. They were a rough, proud, and independent people, like most of the Highland clans of the period;  and, like many of their neighbors, they were occasionally cattle  thieves and pilferers.

The Massacre Of Glen Coe					Wellington, James E.																											asu0660000019	be regarded as an excuse for the horrors subsequently visited  on the Macdonalds; and they seem to have lived, for the most  part, a decent, uncomplicated life. John Buchan has described  some of their more innocent pleasures:  The life in the glen . . . had its refinements and its hours of  merriment. On the summer evenings on the haughs there would  be tossing the caber, and races among the young men and fierce  games of shinty. Up in the shieling huts in the twilight the girls  would spin, or dance to the pipes, or listen to old tales or  harpers' tunes. In the winter nights, when the birch billets made  the peat fires leap, and the doors were shut, there would be snug  gatherings; the old men at their tobacco, the wives at the spinning, and the young folk at their songs and tales.2  The Macdonalds were, in all probability, no more lawless than  their Highland neighbors, but they had offended the wrong  people. Six months before Mac Ian's storm-ridden journey, Sir  John Campbell, Earl of Breadalbane, a powerful Scottish nobleman, had accused the Macdonalds of having stolen some of his  cattle and had threatened to seek vengeance. This raid had been  a military foray, not an act of private theft; but the difference  was of no consequence to the Earl of Breadalbane. Moreover,  marching home from Killiecrankie in 1689 and needing provisions, the Macdonalds had plundered the lands and stolen  some of the livestock of Robert Campbell, laird of Glenlyon  and a fellow clansman of the Earl of Argyll, in another military  raid. The action ruined Campbell of Glenlyon, though he had  long been in difficult financial straits, and as a result he found  it necessary to accept a commission as captain in their majesties'  army. In this capacity he will be heard from again in this narrative. The third and most powerful enemy of Clan Macdonald  was Sir John Dalrymple (1648-1707), Master of Stair and King  William's secretary of state for Scotland. The animosity of the  Master of Stair toward the Macdonalds seems to have arisen  not so much from political enmity against the Jacobites as from  a rankling zeal to destroy the whole of Highland society as a  hotbed of lawlessness, ferocity, and civil disorder.  In the dreadful events which followed Mac Ian's tardy oath  of allegiance to William, the Master of Stair played a decisive  role. Even the Whig historian Macaulay speaks of him in the  following words, echoing a terrible phrase—"rooted out"—  • 21 	asu06600000190023001							66164788 Bytes	3847	5731	2062699072	RGB	8	600	asu06600000190023001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/769	769	770.jp2	/asu0660/image/770.jp2
The Massacre Of Glen Coe					Wellington, James E.																											asu0660000019	I  which sounds and resounds throughout the correspondence of  those who sealed the doom of the Macdonalds:  He hated the Highlanders, not as enemies of this or that dynasty,  but as enemies of law, of industry, and of trade. In his private  correspondence he applied to them the short and terrible form  of words in which the implacable Roman pronounced the doom  of Carthage. His project was no less than this, that the whole  hill country from sea to sea, and the neighboring islands, should  be wasted with fire and sword, that the Camerons, the Macleans,  and all the branches of the race of Macdonald, should be rooted  out.3  It is therefore hardly surprising that upon the late signing of Mac  Ian there followed a complex and curious exchange of letters  and directives involving the king, the Master of Stair, Sir Thomas  Livingstone (Commander-in-Chief in Scotland), Colonel Hill  and Lieutenant-Colonel Hamilton (in charge of Fort William),  Major Robert Duncanson and Captain Robert Campbell of Glenlyon (in command of the troops subsequently sent to Glen Coe).  The first of these letters was written by the Master of Stair to  Livingstone on 7 January, one day after Mac Ian's submission,  informing Livingstone that he would shortly be ordered by the  king to  . . . destroy entirely the country of Lochaber, Lochiel's lands,  Keppoch's, Glengarry's and Glencoe's. Your power shall be  large enough. I hope the soldiers will not trouble the government with prisoners.4  This could not have been a direct order from the Master of Stair  to Livingstone, since the Master, as secretary of state for Scotland, was a civil official and not authorized to issue orders to  the military. It was only a way of putting Livingstone on notice  and of making his own wishes (and doubtless those of Argyll  and Breadalbane) known to the commander-in-chief. Two days  later, however, he had learned that all the dilatory chiefs except  Glengarry had taken the oath, and he wrote to Livingstone his  regret "that Keppoch and M'Kean [sic] of Glencoe are safe."5  Two days after this (11 January) the Master of Stair forwarded  to Livingstone an order from King William commanding military action against those chiefs who had not yet signed the oath.  To accompany the king's order he enclosed a letter of his own  in which he gleefully remarked:  •  22  |MHHMH|[BBHH||MMMH|BBH|| 	asu06600000190024001							66360384 Bytes	3847	5748	47835770	RGB	8	600	asu06600000190024001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/770	770	771.jp2	/asu0660/image/771.jp2
The Massacre Of Glen Coe					Wellington, James E.																											asu0660000019	Argyle tells me that Glencoe hath not taken the oath, at which  I rejoice. It is a great work of charity to be exact in rooting out  that damnable set.6  A few days later an order went out from the king to Livingstone  directing that terms be offered to Glengarry, who actually refused to sign the oath; but of Mac Ian of Glen Coe, who had  signed it, this same order went on to say:  If M'Kean [sic] of Glencoe and that tribe can be well separated  from the rest, it will be a proper vindication of the public justice  to extirpate that sept of thieves.7  Oddly enough, the king saw fit to sign this order twice, a very  unusual procedure. To the king's order the Master of Stair added  in his own accompanying letter:  ... for a just example of vengeance, I entreat that the thieving  tribe in Glencoe may be rooted out in earnest.8  Thus did the Master of Stair once again make his desires known.  He became even more explicit on 30 January, when he wrote  to Livingstone that, since Mac Ian had signed late and presided  over a gang of vagabonds anyway, the Macdonalds should not  be merely tormented; they should be utterly destroyed:  I think to herry their cattle or burn their houses is but to render  them desperate, lawless men, to rob their neighbours: but I believe you will be satisfied it were a great advantage to the nation  that thieving tribe were rooted out and cut off. It must be quietly  done, otherwise they will make shift for both the men and their  cattle.9  To Hill he wrote of the impending attack on Glen Coe, "Let it  be secret and sudden."10 In view of this pretty parcel of letters  it is small wonder that Livingstone, in his turn, could have written  to his subordinates at Fort William the following echo of the  Master of Stair's wishes:  I understand that the laird of Glencoe, coming after the prefixed time, was not admitted to take the oath, which is very  good news here seeing that at Court it's wished he had not taken  it so that that thieving nest might be rooted out, for the Secretary in three of his last letters hath made mention of him and  it is known at Court he has not taken it. So, Sir, here is a fair  occasion for you to show that your garrison serves for some  use; and seeing that the orders are so positive from Court to  me not to spare any of them that have not timely come in, . . .  ♦ 23 	asu06600000190025001							66624572 Bytes	3865	5744	1168892565	RGB	8	600	asu06600000190025001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/771	771	772.jp2	/asu0660/image/772.jp2
The Massacre Of Glen Coe					Wellington, James E.																											asu0660000019	I desire you would begin with Glencoe, and spare nothing which  belongs to him, but do not trouble the Government with prisoners. 11  Livingstone's letter was acted on within ten days. On 1 February 1692 a company of 120 men of Argyll's regiment, under  the command of Captain Robert Campbell of Glenlyon, were  quartered on the people of Glen Coe under the pretense of establishing a base from which to gather taxes in the neighborhood.  The glen in which they found themselves, subsequently famous  from the Ossian tales, was (and still is) a wild, forbidding, and  strangely beautiful valley situated where the River Coe—Ossian's  "dark Cona"—flows between stark, naked precipices of stone.  Macaulay, who mistakenly believed that Glen Coe meant "Glen  of Weeping" in Gaelic, called it ". . . the very Valley of the  Shadow of Death. Mists and storms brood over it through the  greater part of the finest summer; and even on those rare days  when the sun is bright, and when there is no cloud in the sky,  the impression made by the landscape is sad and awful."12 Robert Louis Stevenson, in his novel Kidnapped, described the glen  as "a prodigious valley, strewn with rocks, where ran a foaming  river." Charles Dickens called it "perfectly terrible ... an awful  place." Andrew Lang, by contrast, thought of Glen Coe as "one  of the most beautiful valleys in the beautiful West Highlands . . .  The Coe is as clear as the Itchen; the loch [Loch Leven] lies a  sheet of silver washed with gold; the inhabitants are an industrious populace, great as volunteers, full of old traditions, and  not too incredulous about the second sight."13 Throughout the  year the mists are ever swirling and flying across the waters of  "echoing Cona"; herds of red deer nibble quietly at the sparse  vegetation on the hillsides; and the great golden eagle wheels  and soars over the summit of Stob Dearg. For a few short weeks  in June the grass is spangled with violets, hyacinth, and celandine; and in July the gold-and-red bog asphodel shoots its small  flame along the riverbanks. In good weather, men say, the fairy  music can be heard faintly sounding within the hills. But in  February 1692 the snow and sleet howled through the passes  of the glen; and the soldiers of Clan Campbell warmed their  hands, played games of cards, and ate and drank their fill beside  the chimney fires of Clan Macdonald—hereditary enemies but  •  24 	asu06600000190026001							66845260 Bytes	3905	5704	3516802086	RGB	8	600	asu06600000190026001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/772	772	773.jp2	/asu0660/image/773.jp2
The Massacre Of Glen Coe					Wellington, James E.																											asu0660000019	honored guests, according to the strict Highland code of hospitality, in the gray, thatched cottages of stone and timber that  the people of the glen called home. The poet Thomas Campbell,  himself a descendent of the Argyll Campbells, has described the  cottages of Glen Coe like this:  The Jacobite white rose festoon'd their door;  The windows sash'd and glaz'd, the oaken floor,  The chimney graced with antlers of the deer,  The rafters hung with meat for winter cheer.14  (The Pilgrim of Glencoe, lines 82-85)  Amid these hospitable surroundings the soldiers of the Argyll  Campbells lived for twelve whole days, from the first to the  twelfth of February 1692, accepting the food and drink and  entertainment of the people of the glen. Glenlyon himself, whose  niece was married to Alexander Macdonald, the younger son  of Mac Ian, took his morning draught every day at Alexander's  cottage, and on the evening of 12 February played a friendly  game of cards with Alexander and his elder brother.  Also on 12 February Colonel Hill, with considerable reluctance, ordered eight hundred more troops to Glen Coe, half of  them from Argyll's regiment, under his second in command at  Fort William, Lieutenant-Colonel Hamilton, and one Major  Robert Duncanson, who has been described by Aytoun as "a  morose, brutal, and savage man."15 Hamilton ordered Duncan-  son to attack the Macdonalds before daybreak the following  morning. He commanded, in effect, that there should be a total  massacre, with no one spared and no prisoners taken (another  echo of the Master of Stair)—and added that "the old fox and  his sons" should on no account be allowed to escape. Duncanson  dutifully relayed these instructions to Campbell of Glenlyon in  the following incredible directive:  ballacholis, 12 February, 1692  SIR,—You are hereby ordered to fall upon the rebels, the  M'Donalds of Glencoe, and putt all to the sword under seventy.  You are to have special care that the old fox and his sons doe  upon no account escape your hands. You are to secure all the  avenues, that no man escape. This you are to put in execution  att five o'clock in the morning precisely, and by that time, or  very shortly after it, I'll strive to be att you with a stronger  party. If I doe not come to you att five, you are not to tarry for  me, but to fall on.

Expecting you will not faill in the fulfilling  hereof as you love yourself, I subscribe these with my hand.  ROBERT DUNCANSON  For their Majesties' service.  To Captain Robert Campbell of Glenlyon.16  This dreadful letter was never placed before the commission  which subsequently investigated the Glen Coe massacre. The  strong wording and veiled threats which it contains suggest the  possibility, at least, that Glenlyon may have had little stomach  for the job which his superiors were ordering him to perform.  It is likely that the common soldiers of the regiment felt the  same way. They were apparently not told until 12 February  what their work was to be the next morning, and the tradition  persisted for years afterward throughout the Highlands that they  tried in various timid ways to warn their hosts of what was  coming. One soldier is supposed to have said aloud to a great  stone, known as Cleach Enruig (still standing in the glen), "Gray  stone of the glen, though great is thy right to be here, if thou  knewest what would happen tonight thou wouldst no longer tarry  here." Another is said to have uttered a similar warning aloud  to his host's dog. According to a third story, the Argyll piper,  all of a sudden and for no apparent reason, struck up a sad old  tune of war and lamentation called Wives of the Glen.17 And  it is not a tradition but a fact that John Macdonald, Mac Ian's  elder son, was awakened before daybreak by soldiers calling at  his windows in an effort to warn him.  Neither the qualms of Glenlyon nor the warnings of his soldiers did the slightest good. Not long after hearing the outcry  beneath his windows, John Macdonald was awakened by his  servant to see a party of twenty soldiers marching toward his  cottage with fixed bayonets. He immediately escaped with his  brother Alexander to the hills, whence they could hear repeated  shots of musket fire from the glen settlements of Inverrigan and  Achnacon. At Invercoe, about five in the morning, a group of  soldiers led by Lieutenant Lindsay and his brother, knocked at  the door of Mac Ian's cottage. They were instantly admitted;  •  26  Hi) 	asu06600000190028001							67173360 Bytes	3929	5697	3782854522	RGB	8	600	asu06600000190028001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/774	774	775.jp2	/asu0660/image/775.jp2
The Massacre Of Glen Coe					Wellington, James E.																											asu0660000019	and, as the old chief climbed out of bed and turned to order  refreshments for his guests, they shot him in the back. His wife  was stripped naked, and the rings were torn from her fingers by  the soldiers with their teeth. Her life was spared for the moment,  but she died the very next day of shock and exposure.  These atrocities quickly expanded into a general massacre;  and in every corner of the glen, men, women, and children were  butchered in their beds or at their breakfast tables or on their  knees begging for mercy. At Inverrigan, Glenlyon's party tied  up nine men and shot them in cold blood; and at the same place  a thirteen-year-old boy, a woman, and a five-year-old child were  shot in their tracks by order of Captain Drummond. At Ach-  nacon, the soldiers of Sergeant Barbour fired point blank into  a little group of men sitting around a fire and killed five of them.  At another settlement a man of eighty was calmly shot, and another man escaped only by throwing his plaid into the faces of  the soldiers as they approached to kill him. Only the blundering  incompetence of those who planned and executed the slaughter  prevented the entire clan from being wiped out: the soldiers  neglected to block the dark passes through which some of the  clan escaped, and by their use of firearms they gave the alarm  that danger was close at hand. It even seems that several of the  soldiers actually helped their intended victims to get away. One  of the few appealing stories to emerge from the whole fearful  episode is that of a soldier who was ordered to stab a Macdonald  infant to death. Instead, he surreptitiously cut off the baby's  finger so that he could show to his commanding officer the bloodstained bayonet. Years later (the tale continues) the same soldier chanced to be traveling through the Highlands and sought  shelter in a cottage for the night. During the evening he told  the story to his host by the fireside. After he had finished, his  host stared at him silently for a few moments and then held up  his hand—with one finger missing.  During the massacre the entire glen was laid waste—cottages  were burned to the ground; provisions carefully laid up for the  winter were destroyed; the sheep and the goats, the black Angus  cattle, and the little shaggy Highland ponies were either killed  outright or driven off with the departing soldiers. As a result,  those who did escape and did not perish in the snow and cold  •  27 	asu06600000190029001							66146148 Bytes	3856	5716	2692360921	RGB	8	600	asu06600000190029001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/775	775	776.jp2	/asu0660/image/776.jp2
The Massacre Of Glen Coe					Wellington, James E.																											asu0660000019	of the bitter Highland winter returned to a scorched and devastated valley and literally died of starvation. According to  Macaulay,  When the troops had retired, the Macdonalds crept out of the  caverns of Glencoe, ventured back to the spot where the huts  had formerly stood, collected the scorched corpses from among  the smoking ruins, and performed some rude rites of sepulture.  The tradition runs that the hereditary bard of the tribe took his  seat on a rock which overhung the place of slaughter, and poured forth a long lament over his murdered brethren and his  desolate home. Eighty years later that sad dirge was still repeated in the populations of the valley.18  Such was the massacre of Glen Coe, an act of butchery in  which, out of an adult male population of about 150, thirty-  eight were killed by the soldiers, including old men of seventy  and eighty. The number of victims—especially women and children—who subsequently died of exposure and starvation will  never be known. And the crowning irony of the whole business  is that for this brutal act of sheer treachery and vengeance no  one was ever punished and no real blame has ever been laid.  Three years later a royal commission, including Lord Tweedale  and other members of the Privy Council, was appointed to inquire into the Glen Coe massacre behind closed doors; and  several representatives of the surviving Macdonalds were permitted to appear and state their case. The commission concluded  by declaring that "murder under trust" had indeed been done  and requested that Glenlyon and other subordinate officers involved be prosecuted for murder. The prosecution never took  place. Glenlyon was later promoted to colonel, though the memory of the Macdonalds of Glen Coe, it is said, haunted him to  his death. Colonel Hill, who disliked his orders from the start  and actually succored many of the survivors after the massacre,  was knighted. Hamilton fled the country. Livingstone was elevated to the peerage as Lord Teviot. The rest pursued their  military careers and distinguished themselves in various ways  for bravery in action.19  Of the higher personages involved, the Earl of Breadalbane,  who hated the Macdonalds and obviously abetted and encouraged the Master of Stair, was accused by the commission of high  treason; but he was never brought to trial.

The Massacre Of Glen Coe					Wellington, James E.																											asu0660000019	covered by the commission was an unsuccessful attempt by  Breadalbane to gain from the Macdonalds a written statement  exonerating him from complicity in the massacre.20 The Master  of Stair, the man most directly responsible, was censured by the  commission and relieved by the king of his office as secretary  of state for Scotland. This, however, was the merest wrist slapping; and in 1703 Sir John Dalrymple was created an earl—he  became first Earl of Stair. Even William III himself—who  thought so little of the massacre of Glen Coe that he left the  country a few weeks afterward and was also out of the country  three years later when the commission sat—even William played  a role in the massacre which is both ambiguous and strange. The  double signature itself is hard to explain; and William is known  to have been hostile to the Highland clans for their Jacobite  sympathies, having once projected a plan, later revoked, for their  total extermination. If he did not realize the interpretation that  was to be placed upon his vaguely worded orders regarding the  Macdonalds of Glen Coe, he must be said to be guilty of criminal stupidity and neglect of the welfare of his people. However  all this may be (and historians are divided on the point), William's name, "the Whig deliverer," has remained for generations  anathema to the people of the Scottish Highlands; and his name,  along with those of Sir John Campbell, Earl of Breadalbane,  and Sir John Dalrymple, Master of Stair, will forever be associated with a breach of hospitality, a violation of common humanity, an act of remorseless treachery and slaughter, which has  never been punished by any mode of human justice and can  never be measured in the words of any language known to man.

Juan Ramón Jiménez and Zenobia					Owre, J. Riis																											asu0660000016	THE  CARRELL  Volume 8 December, 1967 Number 2  Juan Ramon Jimenez and Zenobia  Their association with the University of Miami  J. Riis Owre  In our midst for three years (1939-42), there lived one of  Spain's—one of the world's—greatest poets in our century,  Juan Ramon Jimenez. When he came to Florida (January  29, 1939), fleeing from a Spain in chaos, Juan Ramon was of  course known the world over. He had been warmly received in  New York, in Cuba, and in Puerto Rico. In Miami, except for  a few at the University, his presence went almost unnoticed. That  did not displease him. A retiring person always, he was now  seeking peace, solitude, a chance to rebuild his thoughts and his  emotions after the horrible experience of the bombardment of  Madrid. What I shall try to set down here is the close and cordial  association which Juan Ramon and Zenobia developed with the  University of Miami.  Soon after his arrival, the poet was appointed Lecturer in  Spanish; his name is thus listed in the General Announcement  of the University for 1940-41 through 1944-45. A course in  Contemporary Spanish Poetry (Spanish 442) was especially  created for him. It was a series of nine informal talks (charlas).  The poet taught it twice: in 1940, from February 13 to April 9;  and in 1942, from February 10 to March 31. The first announcement of this course in the Bulletin of the Adult Education  Division (Vol. 13, no. 6, January 15, 1940) bears the notation  "Registration only after consultation with Dr. Owre." I suppose  this is one of the few cases on record in which admission to one  faculty member's course was granted only by another. The rea-  •  1 	asu06600000160003001							65163116 Bytes	3847	5643	1669013052	RGB	8	600	asu06600000160003001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/786	786	787.jp2	/asu0660/image/787.jp2
Juan Ramón Jiménez and Zenobia					Owre, J. Riis																											asu0660000016	son was that the poet wanted in his course only those students  who understood and loved poetry. He had no patience with  mere credit-seekers. It was my duty to screen them out.  This course—Juan Ramon Jimenez's first teaching experience on United States soil—was an exciting thing for us: contemporary Spanish poets as seen by the greatest of them all.  (Of this—of my notes of it—I shall write on another occasion  more at length.) The course was first listed in the bulletin of the  University for 1940-41. It was kept in the bulletin through  1946-47. In that year, Juan Ramon was invited to come back  to Miami permanently, but he declined the offer. The course  was then eliminated from the curriculum.  Juan Ramon also honored the writer's own class in Survey  of Spanish Literature (Spanish 402) with a reading of nine of  his own poems, some of them not yet published at the time.  (This was in April of 1940.)  In those days we had at the University an annual lecture  series, the Hispanic-American Intitute. A spiritual descendent of  the then-famous Winter Institute of Literature, which started in  the first year of the University's existence, it brought to the  campus during the winter season important lecturers from many  lands.* Juan Ramon lectured six times before the rather large  audiences we had, always in Spanish, always speaking slowly  and clearly, as was his custom, and always being interpreted—  perhaps "paraphrased" is a better word—into English by members of the Spanish faculty. Here is the schedule:  Fifth Session of the Institute (January 1940):  January 15: Poesia y literatura  January 16: Aristocracia y democracia  January 17: Ramon Maria del Valle-Inclan  Sixth Session (March 1942):  March 5:    El trabajo gustoso  March 6:    Limite del progreso  March 16: Sucesion de la democracia  ♦The present Winter Institute of the Arts represents a continuation of the same  tradition. 	asu06600000160004001							64057964 Bytes	3788	5635	4227640316	RGB	8	600	asu06600000160004001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/787	787	788.jp2	/asu0660/image/788.jp2
Juan Ramón Jiménez and Zenobia					Owre, J. Riis																											asu0660000016	These lectures were unforgettable. They were, if anything, sombre; there was no baroque Hispanic glitter; but there was wit,  substance, emotion, philosophy.  The three lectures of the fifth session of the Institute subsequently appeared in print in the University of Miami Hispanic-  American Studies (Number II, January 1941). The lectures  on Toesia y literatura' and 'Aristocracia y democracia' were  first editions, which caused a good deal of comment in the literary world. The University still receives occasionally requests  for these, but this number of the Studies has been long out-of-  print and the special reprints we had made for the poet have  also disappeared. Incidentally, the reprints of these three lectures were among the documents submitted by the faculty of  the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures of the  University of Maryland, in recommending the poet for the 1956  Nobel Prize in Literature.  Juan Ramon's series of aphorisms, 'Estetica y etica estetica',  was published in Number III of the Hispanic-American Studies  (March 1942).  The last publication dealing with the poet to appear with the  University imprint was Number XIII of the Studies (February  1956), Professor Donald Fogelquist's monograph The literary  collaboration and the personal correspondence of Ruben Dario  and Juan Ramon Jimenez'.  While the connection between the University and the poet  meant much to the institution, it was not without significance  for Juan Ramon, either. On August 6, 1943, in a letter to Enrique Diez-Canedo, he wrote: "My courses and lectures of the  years 1940, '41, and '42 at the Universities of Miami and Duke,  have produced a major book for me, Modernism, subtitle An  epoch."*  Zenobia, too, developed with the University a close relationship—that of a student. Feeling that sometime she might need  to increase the small income they already had, she began pre-  *Juan  Ramon   Jim6nez,   Pdjina  escojidas:   Prosa,   Madrid,   Gredos,   1958,   p.   256.

From the fall of 1940  through the spring of 1942, she completed the equivalent of  about one year of full-time study. Her record is a very good one.  Zenobia was granted a tuition scholarship. This is the only  thing the couple ever accepted from the University. The modest  honoraria which Juan Ramon received for his lectures and his  teaching were spent, to the last penny, on books for the University  Library, which was a primary interest for him and for Zenobia.  The Spanish collection was then pathetically small, and housed  in depressing quarters in the old Anastasia Building. Zenobia  was frequently seen among those old wooden shelves, checking  books. The selections were carefully made, to fill the gaps and  avoid duplication, a luxury which could by no means be afforded at that stage in the University's development. These two  Spaniards enriched the library with many scores of volumes.  Today, a quarter of a century later, many fine books in the  Spanish collection bear their dedications and signatures.  After Pearl Harbor, the poet became very restless. He felt he  was doing nothing to help the United States, and could find  nothing to do in Miami. In the nation's capital, perhaps, some  appropriate outlet for his energies could be found? He spoke  often of the possibility of having some connection with The  Voice of America. Perhaps thus he could talk to Hispanic America, and help us in our cause. His love for the United States and  his gratitude to the nation were great. Finally, he decided to go  to Washington to live; it was on November 19, 1942 that Juan  Ramon and Zenobia left Miami. Zenobia revisited Coral Gables  several times, but only briefly. Juan Ramon, I believe, never  returned.  Who can forget that association, short though it was? The El  Greco face of Juan Ramon, the gay laughter of Zenobia, the uncomplaining and grateful adjustment of these two from the Old  World to the ways of the New, the thoughtfulness, the concern  for all that is beautiful and deep in the human spirit, the underlying note of sadness in both of them—these remain with us  always. They were two really noble persons; they gave us something which has enriched us forever. 	asu06600000160006001							64431068 Bytes	3808	5638	3014402927	RGB	8	600	asu06600000160006001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/789	789	790.jp2	/asu0660/image/790.jp2

The Haven School					Spirer, Jess																											asu0660000016	7  The Haven School  Jess Spirer  *\HE RECENT announcement of the establishment of  the multimillion dollar University of Miami Facility for  the study of Mental Retardation serves to remind us  how quickly and from what small beginnings we have come so  far in this community's concern for the mentally retarded.  It seems but yesterday that Florence Williams phoned to ask  if I would be interested in helping to organize a school for intellectually retarded children. She said she had already spoken  to Laura Sutter (then in charge of special education programs  in the Dade County Schools) and Dr. Jean Jones Perdue, a  prominent Dade County physician, and had arranged a meeting  at her home. It was nineteen years ago that we met and heard  both Florence and Franklin Williams talk of the almost unbelievably miserable level of care provided retarded children in  our community. And that night as we discussed and evaluated  and took stock of our resources, the idea of the Haven School  came into being.  Our initial goals were quite simple for a day which had grown  accustomed to hearing of multipurpose, complex, multidimensional programs. We were to create a school which would provide a healthy educational experience to students, and could give  the parents and siblings of these students a sense of peace and  security.  My memory of the next two years is packed tight with wispy,  pleasure-giving pictures of innumerable and interminable meetings of our small group, which seems to have been dominated  by the spirit and determination of two women—Florence Williams and Jean Perdue. It was not long before we moved with  vigor among our friends, seeking help. Almost immediately, we  faced the challenge of developing a governing board, and we  decided to select men and women who would reflect the breadth  of socioeconomic and cultural interests of the community, and  would also be willing to make personal sacrifices of time and  energy. So there were John McCudden, real estate broker; Dr. 	asu06600000160009001							64151320 Bytes	3800	5624	2513659531	RGB	8	600	asu06600000160009001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/792	792	793.jp2	/asu0660/image/793.jp2
The Haven School					Spirer, Jess																											asu0660000016	Paul Kells, pioneer psychiatrist; Earl Bowser, plumber; Earl  Schurtz, banker—all of whom are now gone. Among the women  leaders and workers, one thinks of Sylvia Levin, Judge Mattie  Belle Davis (her late husband, Troy, drafted our charter and  papers of incorporation), Miss Gladys Green, and the poet  Hannah Kahn, who has done so much for retarded children in  Dade County.  One of the more fortunate events in Haven's history occurred  the day Michael Shores, attorney and unsung civic leader, became a member of the Board. He has been President of the  School since 1963, and his leadership and strength have given  stability during periods of strain and stress. He has helped the  School to seek new programs and to broaden areas of service  to families of Dade County.  The actual construction of the school soon became a total  community enterprise. For example, it did not take us long to  understand that we needed land in sufficient quantity to take  care of growth for fifteen or twenty years. And being without  funds, it seemed only reasonable that we seek governmental assistance for a project which must honor and render noble service  to our community. Fortified by this rationalization, we began  meeting with all of the members of the County Commission, and  especially with thoughtful and supportive Preston Bird. We soon  had title to thirty-five acres of land situated near the County  Hospital at Kendall.  Then came conferences with the Central Labor Union which  resulted in the gift by organized labor of this county of all labor  required for the construction of the first three buildings on the  new campus. Simultaneously, we met with contractors and suppliers of building materials and we received gifts of sand, blocks,  roofing, nails, lumber, concrete, flooring, bathtubs and all the  hundreds of other items which go into the making of a modern  building.  And then there were our talks with community leaders, with  social agencies, with plain citizens, with fraternal organizations,  with service clubs (especially Kiwanis, Civitan, and Exchange  Clubs which have been helpful for so long). 	asu06600000160010001							64133264 Bytes	3783	5649	522504067	RGB	8	600	asu06600000160010001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/793	793	794.jp2	/asu0660/image/794.jp2
The Haven School					Spirer, Jess																											asu0660000016	Those of us who were lucky enough to be offered the opportunity to give leadership to this project soon understood that  the Haven School literally belonged to this community; that this  was something many people believed worthwhile and with which  they wanted to become involved.  We wanted to create a school for South Florida, available to  all families in which there were retarded children. Our leaders  were a group of hardheaded, adamant idealists, and we were  especially certain that we did not want to make family financial  status a major criterion of eligibility. The school was to be for  those who had to have it; and if the families concerned were  unable to meet our minimum levels of tuition, it would be our  responsibility to help them find the required funds. This continues to be our philosophy although increasing costs of operation place a heavy burden upon the School and threaten its  financial stability. At the time of this writing, there are eighty-  two residential students enrolled at the School, approximately  thirty of whom receive financial assistance toward tuition.  Students first entered Haven on September 1, 1950. We knew  there was no residential training program in effect at any school  for the retarded in Florida, not even at the state institutions,  and we were determined that Haven School would not become  another custodial institution in which our students would spend  their time sitting around dully, idle, bored, staring and seeing  nothing. In retrospect, it seems that we were preoccupied with  many of the same issues and goals which are now associated with  programs of culturally deprived areas.  Our first objective in our educational program was and is to  help students learn to face the responsibilities of self-care. We  therefore deal with such matters as toilet training, dressing and  undressing (do you realize how complex are the skills involved  in buttoning and unbuttoning?), bathing, feeding, taking care  of one's clothing, learning to recognize simple dangers, and  many other necessary, elementary behaviors of equal importance.  We are also interested in teaching the student to meet the  routine demands of simple, loosely-supervised group life. This  means training children to eat at a table with other children, to 	asu06600000160011001							64630368 Bytes	3813	5648	1238726828	RGB	8	600	asu06600000160011001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/794	794	795.jp2	/asu0660/image/795.jp2

Initially, we experimented with instruction in reading, writing  and arithmetic, but we have come to understand that formal  education in these traditional classroom subjects has limited  value to the severely retarded, and that greater gains in personal  growth may often result when instruction is directed toward the  development of work skills. Consequently, we have both types  of programs available to our students—academic instruction offered by three full-time certified teachers, arts and crafts for the  younger children, and a variety of on-the-job training opportunities, both part-time and full-time, for the older students.  As our school grows older, the age of our population keeps  apace. The average age of our students is over sixteen years,  and thirty of our students are clearly beyond school age. Aging  of our students has forced us to consider and develop new types  of programs in order to avoid the creation of an atmosphere of  apathy so typical of many so-called schools for the retarded.  Our Executive Director, James Clark, a professional educator,  who holds the master's degree in Education, carefully surveyed  the school and found that there were a number of spots in which  older students could fit quite easily. On-the-job training programs were developed in short order, and in time our students  have learned to work in the kitchen and laundry and to carry  out janitorial and maintenance tasks. We have also developed  a homemakers program for older girls which prepares them to  function as cooks' assistants and to assume a variety of housekeeping chores; four girls have learned to be assistants to classroom teachers.  The Executive Director decided that it would be wise to  start a small farming program, and we now have twenty-five  acres under cultivation, with rows of green stuff coming out of  the ground for all to see and take pride in.  Visitors to Haven School are usually delighted with our small  store at which students are able to make purchases of candy,  cookies and a variety of trinkets and gadgets.

At specified hours, the store is  open for business, and students stand around, holding their  tokens, carefully examining the stock of merchandse from which  they will make their selections.  By this time, it should be clear to the reader that Haven is  a "reward oriented" rather than a "punishment oriented" school.  It is our belief that humans learn better when they are treated  with dignity and consideration, and are not abused or degraded.  We therefore try to reward healthy, non-destructive behavior,  and do all we can to produce an environment which is conducive  to effective group living.  We have plans for the future. At the moment, for example,  there are thirty children enrolled in our day-care, non-residential  program. We hope, by improving our transportation facilities  and by finding new sources of financial support, to double or  even triple this number within a short time. We have already  completed arrangements for the necessary physical facilities and  staff for the expanded program, and our faith in the importance  of what we offer leaves little doubt that the necessary financing  will inevitably appear.  The building of a sheltered workshop holds a high place on  our list of needs and priorities. Many of our students are capable of learning a variety of routine, uncomplicated skills which  may be applied to any number of tasks. The training spectrum  is narrow, but there is a spectrum. This fact may eventually open  the way to negotiating typical sheltered workshop contracts out  of which it becomes possible for seriously handicapped young  men and women to become productive people, not only capable  of contributing in some measure to their own support, but also  finding satisfaction in the process of accomplishment.  There is obviously much more one might say about a place  as vital and exciting as the Haven School. I would like to close  this statement with an invitation to visit and see for yourself.  This is how believers are made. 	asu06600000160013001							65118436 Bytes	3833	5661	2600744124	RGB	8	600	asu06600000160013001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/796	796	797.jp2	/asu0660/image/797.jp2
The Organization For Tropical Studies					Leigh, W. Henry																											asu0660000016	The Organization For  Tropical Studies  W. Henry Leigh  THE TERM "tropics" usually conjures up images best  exemplified by hot, humid, lowland jungles, swamps,  and forests. However, the tropics also include high  montane forests, cool plateaus, snow-covered mountains, and  some desert areas. This diversity of habitats is partly responsible  for the fact that an estimated four-fifths of all known species of  organisms live in the tropics. However, the most important distinguishing feature of the tropics is an abundance of sunlight.  In ways that the biologist does not yet thoroughly comprehend,  the intense and almost constant solar radiation on either side  of the equator creates many structural, physiological, and behavioral side effects in the plant and animal species that have  evolved in this region. In general, there are many more species  of organisms per unit area and great diversity as compared with  the species of more familiar temperate zones. The total productivity in terms of plant and animal mass per unit area is greater,  and the environmental niches which support diverse types of organisms are more numerous and varied. The dynamics of interactions of the many plant and animal species are highly  complex, and the adaptations of organisms to each other and  to this environment are more striking here than in any other  environment. Yet, stangely enough, these most highly organized  and complex biotic communities on earth are the least thoroughly studied and understood.  We have to confess, in an era of great emphasis on the biological sciences, that we are largely ignorant of the basic species  composition and ecology of vast tropical areas. Why are there  so few persons trained to do the necessary work? Fewer biologists in recent years have been trained in the multi-disciplinary  science of ecology because of the exciting developments in the  fields of molecular and cellular biology. Those biologists who  have specialized in ecology have been trained in universities  located in the temperate zone, and their knowledge of temperate  •   10 	asu06600000160014001							64629868 Bytes	3813	5648	745050935	RGB	8	600	asu06600000160014001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/797	797	798.jp2	/asu0660/image/798.jp2

Biologists have compelling and urgent reasons to study the  biota and ecosystems of the tropics since they are so poorly  understood at present. Biotic communities and ecosystems are  much more complex than those of temperate areas. In vast  areas of the tropics a large percentage of the species of plants  and animals has never been described. The even more important interplay among the many tropical species that determine  the dynamics of the natural communities cannot be studied until  we know the basic species composition of the communities. The  physical aspects of tropical environments, such as climate, soil  structure, water resources, and their relationships, are not well  understood. Scientists have only scratched the surface in our  understanding of the tropics.  In February, 1963, representatives of seven North American  universities and the University of Costa Rica met on the campus  of the University of Miami and formed the Organization for  Tropical Studies, Inc. (OTS), which was incorporated under  the laws of the State of Florida. The original North American  institutions were the University of Florida, Harvard University,  University of Kansas, University of Miami, University of Michigan, University of Southern California, and the University of  Washington. Shortly thereafter, the University of California  (all Campuses) and Louisiana State University joined. Within  the last two years the University of Hawaii, University of Indiana, Michigan State University, University of North Carolina,  Smithsonian Institution, Texas A & M, Texas Tech and the University of Wisconsin have been added. This makes a total of  twenty North American universities and one Latin American  university joined in a common effort to add to the information  about the tropical regions of the world and to train students to  effectively attack unsolved problems of the tropics.  The rapid rise in institutional memberships in OTS reflects  the growing interest and concern on many U.S. campuses over  the fact that the tropics are the last great frontier for human  occupancy left on this planet. Knowledgeable observers see  happening in the tropics a repeat performance of what man  •   11 	asu06600000160015001							64444840 Bytes	3798	5654	2770415992	RGB	8	600	asu06600000160015001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/798	798	799.jp2	/asu0660/image/799.jp2
The Organization For Tropical Studies					Leigh, W. Henry																											asu0660000016	has done to the temperate zones in drastically altering environments under the pressure of population increases and the exploitation of natural resources. Just as our North American  ancestors saw the wilderness area as an enemy to be destroyed  by burning and the axe, so now do the expanding human populations in the tropics alter and destroy their natural environments at an alarming rate. At most levels in tropical societies,  including the governmental, there is little knowledge of or  interest in the future consequence of man's actions in destruction of forests, water resources, native soils, and wildlife.  Why should there be an organization that specifically concerns itself with the tropics? What most clearly distinguishes  the tropics from the temperate areas to the north and south  of the tropics? Why are the tropics suddenly taking on such  importance to scholars in a number of disciplines? Why are  we so ignorant of the natural characteristics and human ecology  of so vast an area, and why are there so few persons knowledgeable and adequately trained to work effectively in their respective disciplines in the tropics?  It became apparent prior to 1962 that there was a need for  a consortium of universities to work in a more organized fashion  towards common objectives. Representatives of a number of  North American universities were independently attempting to  make arrangements with Latin American universities—the University of Costa Rica in particular—to serve as a base of operations for their separate programs. Making separate cooperative  arrangements with the University of Costa Rica created problems since that institution's resources were limited.  The majority of individuals making requests for funding tropical programs went to the National Science Foundation, and this  agency encouraged tropical scientists to explore the possibilities  of working together in a more organized fashion by supporting  a conference in 1962 on "Problems of Education and Research  in the Tropics." This conference was held on the University of  Costa Rica campus, and set the stage of the 1963 meeting at  Miami and the formation of OTS. Since its formation, OTS has  been engaged in the promotion of the study of tropical science,  principally biology, and conducting programs of graduate train-  •   12 	asu06600000160016001							63978912 Bytes	3792	5622	2132399369	RGB	8	600	asu06600000160016001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/799	799	800.jp2	/asu0660/image/800.jp2
The Organization For Tropical Studies					Leigh, W. Henry																											asu0660000016	ing and research on tropical problems. Its graduate training  program has been funded by the National Science Foundation  and by the dues and assessments of member institution. The  Organization has also served as a national and international  agency for coordinating programs and aiding individuals and  groups who are carrying on tropical studies.  OTS does not limit participation in its program to member  institutions. Its objective is to serve the entire scientific community. It accepts qualified graduate students into its courses  from non-member institutions, supports research on tropical  problems by individuals from any institution, and facilitates independently funded studies of individuals working in the tropics  even though they have no formal identification with OTS.  There is ample justification for an organization of academically oriented persons to concern themselves with the tropical  region. A little more than one-quarter of the earth's land area  lies within the tropics, and it is an area of dense human populations. A vast ocean area, incompletely understood and with a  great potential for the benefit of mankind, also lies within the  tropics. Dr. Harrison Brown has estimated that the world population by the year 2,000 will have increased from its present  numbers in excess of 3 billion to approximately IVi billion. Of  this number, 6 billion persons will be living in what are now  commonly referred to as the "underdeveloped nations," many  of which lie within the tropics.  With expanding human populations it is inevitable that without a check, what were, a few years ago, regarded as almost  endless areas of tropical wilderness will be totally destroyed or  drastically altered. Only the few persons who are specialists in  tropical biology can really comprehend the speed at which  forests are being cleared, watersheds destroyed, swamps drained,  and animal and plant species eliminated. Without preservation,  in a few years, or at the most a generation or two, the few remaining natural environments will be gone. These changes are  being made in most cases in response to immediate needs for  more agricultural land, but without any comprehension of the  long term consequences to future human populations and with  no knowledge of the necessity of establishing and maintaining  •   13 	asu06600000160017001							64465788 Bytes	3808	5641	3091446250	RGB	8	600	asu06600000160017001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/800	800	801.jp2	/asu0660/image/801.jp2
The Organization For Tropical Studies					Leigh, W. Henry																											asu0660000016	enduring ecological relationships with the land on which man  depends for his sustenance. Little comprehension exists of the  fact that social and economic problems are inextricably entwined with the complex web of land-plant-animal-man relationships.  OTS strives to give professionally trained biologists and their  graduate students the tropical experience which will interest  them in a life long commitment to tropical research and training.  It will take many years to understand the tropics as well as we  do the temperate zones, and the outlook is not a hopeful one  at the present rate that tropical environments are being destroyed by unwise man-land relationships. Basic agriculture and  therefore the national economies of tropical nations depend in  part on their wise use of the land. Social and political stability  depend to a large extent on the linkage between man and his  understanding of the limitations and the potential of his environmental resources. Ignorance of these fundamental concepts  can have long term, catastrophic results.  Since 1964 OTS has had over 300 graduate students from  many institutions in intimate contact with the tropics in organized training activities. The faculties of many United States and  Latin American universities have become more knowledgeable  of the tropics as they share in the training of graduate students.  Many graduate students have indicated a desire to return to  carry out research activities. OTS now has both National Science  Foundation and Ford Foundation support for its research programs. There is little doubt that the level of educational and research activity will steadily increase.  The Organization for Tropical Studies, in the form of twenty  major North American universities and the University of Costa  Rica, has dedicated itself to the important task of trying to prevent in the tropics, as far as possible, the mistakes we have made  in the more "enlightened and progressive" temperate zone which  most of us call "home."  OTS was formed in response to a need—to build a solid base  of scientific information about the tropics by an organized attack on major problems delineated by many individuals repre-  •   14 	asu06600000160018001							63995072 Bytes	3782	5637	3344989058	RGB	8	600	asu06600000160018001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/801	801	802.jp2	/asu0660/image/802.jp2

Henry																											asu0660000016	senting several universities, and to train other individuals to join  in an effort to preserve tropical ecoystems and reduce and repair the damage to them as it becomes possible. The initial  effort of OTS has been made in the area of tropical ecology.  More recently the training program has been broadened to include the disciplines of geography and forestry. It is anticipated  that scholars in other disciplines, such as meteorology and anthropology, will avail themselves of the opportunity to develop  their own programs of tropical studies under the "umbrella"  of OTS.

Four Generations of Cuban Painters, 1895-1940					Castro, Martha de																											asu0660000016	Four Generations of Cuban Painters,  1895-1940  Martha de Castro  The Spanish philosopher Jose Ortega y Gasset introduced the concept of generation in history. Each is  represented by a group of men who both give character  to a period and reflect its unique qualities. It is their double mission to assimilate the past and to express their own personalities.  The late Professor Luis de Soto who founded the chair of art  history at the University of Havana, applied the concept to  Cuban painting and observed four clearly distinguishable generations between 1895 and 1940.  The first of these was romantic and impressionist, the second  in the early twenties was profoundly realistic with deep Spanish  roots, a third appearing in 1925 reflected a crucial antagonism  between traditionalists and innovators, and the fourth in 1940  was representative of the contemporary expressionism and abstractionism assimilated through the baroque heritage.  A later development among Cubans at home and in exile  might be called the generation of 1950. In art it evolved from  concrete and abstract forms toward an international trend of  surrealist expressionism. Communist Cuba has not yet produced  a first rate artist to give identity to a generation, nor have Cubans  in exile.  To commemorate the inauguration of the Cuban Republic on  May 20, 1902, an art exhibit to illustrate the evolution of Cuban  painting through its first four generations was prepared at the  Koubek Center of the University of Miami and opened on May  18, 1967, as part of the Cuban Culture Program of the Division  of Continuing Education. The paintings came from artists themselves and from private collectors at Miami and Palm Beach.  Although there were omissions because of the dispersion of  Cuban artists throughout the United States and the unavailability  of the works of many others in Cuba, it was possible to put to-  •   16 	asu06600000160020001							64453828 Bytes	3808	5640	4156345653	RGB	8	600	asu06600000160020001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/803	803	804.jp2	/asu0660/image/804.jp2

Four Generations of Cuban Painters, 1895-1940					Castro, Martha de																											asu0660000016	gether a representative show.  The first generation of 1895 was representative of the turn of  the century tendencies. The artists of that age emerged from the  Academy of Painting and Sculpture named "San Alejandro" in  Havana. Paintings of Armando Menocal and Leopoldo Roman-  ach showed the romantic landscape of the nineteenth century.  Romanach turned also in his last years toward impressionism  with a deep preoccupation with light and gray shades. Both were  representative of the academic learning.  The generation of the early twenties was represented by a  general trend toward the Spanish realism as seen in the work  of Eugenio G. Olivera. The individual temperaments began to  appear and Cuban tropicalism is seen in the landscapes of Antonio Rodriguez Morey. Emerald greens appear in the fields  which are surrounded by royal palms and bohios, the primitive  dwelling of the Guajiro, or farmer. A masterful presentation of  squalls, rain and ponds was typical in Morey, as were the characteristics of a tropical landscape washed after the rain.  One of the highest moments in the growth of our artistic production was reached by the generation of 1925, expressed mainly  by Victor Manuel, Ponce, Carlos Enriquez and Gattorno. The  schism between innovators and traditionalists occurs here, pointing out for the first time in the history of Cuban painting the  liberation of the painter from the importance of the subject matter, the pathetic literature, and the academic monochromatism.  Among the ones who remained traditionalists but with an outstanding knowledge of the metier are Domingo Ramos and Gum-  ersindo Barea, the best exponents of the Spanish impressionism  showing always a romantic content.  In the flowers of Sara Martinez Maresma there is a delicate  realism. Esteban Valderrama, Mercedes Carballal de Remos and  Felix Cossio represent the realist idealized portrait related to the  English School.  But the rupture with the Academy and the appearance for  the first time of the School of Paris is seen in the primitivism  of Victor Manuel, the emotional expressionism of Fidelio Ponce,  the surrealism of Carlos Enriquez and Antonio Gattorno.  •   17 	asu06600000160023001							65217940 Bytes	3824	5683	1628691035	RGB	8	600	asu06600000160023001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/806	806	807.jp2	/asu0660/image/807.jp2
Four Generations of Cuban Painters, 1895-1940					Castro, Martha de																											asu0660000016	The group of 1940 was mostly self-taught and also deeply  influenced by Picasso and the Mexican school of painting. The  well developed Indo-Americanism—a particular trend of Latin  American painting—appears in Cuba for the first time through  a rich expressionism where the tropical color and the splendor  of light was seen. The artists are drunk with color and light.  Influences: our tropical sun, the richness of our flowers and fruits,  the rhythm of Afro-Cuban music and costumes, the gold and  polychromy of baroque church ornaments, the color of colonial  stained glass, the lithography of cigar boxes. The result: a subjective expressionism as a form of Indo-Americanism. The color  is always brilliant, daring, exhuberant, naive   Baroque style which is a tradition in the country appears not  only in subject matter but in the form and content. Baroque  abstractionism is one of the best expressions of the period showing the beginning of a national trend. Perhaps the best representatives are still in Cuba but Cundo Bermudez, Rafael Soriano  and Jose M. Mijares are good examples of this. This was also  seen in the paintings of Enrique Riveron, who belonged first to  the previous generation but who has joined the youngest one.  Another artist who is older but still active today is Maria Cap-  devila, represented in the exhibit by a sample of neo-realistic  expressionism.  Eberto Escobedo and Guillermo Mesa are still representatives  of the English School in portraits. Escobedo was perhaps the only  pupil of Ponce who has received from the master the delicate  palette through a subjective expressionism.  Mario Carreno, who is one of the principal artists of this generation, has cultivated all the international "isms." Here he was  represented as surrealist.  Felix Ramos is the best well-known painter among the exiles.  He has inherited from his father Domingo a taste for the Cuban  tropical landscape but has also achieved a tentative and cautious  expressionism.  More than four hundred people visited the exhibit of "Four  Generations of Cuban Painters" at the Koubek Center, which  lasted only one day.  •   18 	asu06600000160024001							39061690 Bytes	3808	5633	3541567145	RGB	8	600	asu06600000160024001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/807	807	808.jp2	/asu0660/image/808.jp2

The Library has recently acquired the manuscript journal kept by  Dr. Cathcart Garner during a journey from Cairo to Mombassa in the  year 1901. This is of special interest to the University of Miami because  the expedition passed through the Lake Rudolph country which was the  territory covered by the Maytag Ornithological expedition under the  direction of Dr. Oscar Owre of our Biology Department in 1958-59 under  the auspices of the University of Miami.  The journal records day by day the experiences of the expedition. The  first entry is dated December 14, 1900, and the last is dated September  6, 1901. The journey was an extremely strenuous one. The loss of life  among the personnel as well as the livestock was appalling.  In a later issue of The Carrel, we plan to publish a more detailed  account of the expedition written by Dr. Owre, whose familiarity with  the locality will make his commentary meaningful.  19 	asu06600000160025001							64403300 Bytes	3801	5646	726909124	RGB	8	600	asu06600000160025001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/808	808	809.jp2	/asu0660/image/809.jp2

Meyer Gold					Owre, J. Riis																											asu0660000020	THE  CARRE LL  Volume 10 December 1969 Number 2  Meyer Gold*  J. Rns Owre  I FIRST MET Meyer Gold in 1939, when my wife and I  moved into a house on Alhambra Circle which overlooked  Mr. Gold's garden. He was an enthusiastic amateur gardener then, working with prodigious energy—he had just turned  sixty—and I was only learning to grow things in Florida. We  talked a lot as we spaded and pruned, first about gardens and  plants, then about almost everything. Soon we became friends as  well as neighbors. Frances and Meyer Gold were ideal neighbors  —cordial and helpful, but not demanding, sincerely interested in  these "youngsters" as they called my wife and me, but never  obtrusive.  The first contribution Mr. Gold made to the University of  Miami came, I believe, in December, 1945. One day just before  Christmas he came over and asked me to come out into the  patio. I realized there was "something up"—something he did not  want to discuss before anyone else. He asked me to introduce  him to President Ashe, so he could personally present a gift to  the University. Then he showed me what he had in his hand: a  stock certificate and a memorandum, which directed that the  stock "be held by the University as it will be called soon at a  higher value than the market." It also stipulated that $1000  "be allocated immediately for the Library Fund and designated  for . . . the purchase of Spanish and Portuguese books ... by  Dean Owre."1 The rest of the money—the total value as of the  *A number of friends have aided in the preparation of this article.

Meyer Gold					Owre, J. Riis																											asu0660000020	date of the gift was $5,520—was for the Expansion Fund.  I was much moved. Mr. Gold had known, of course, of my  struggle to build up a Spanish major with almost no books in  the Library. This was a graceful way to express not only his  interest in the University, but his affection for the young professor who was his friend. Surely he can have had little interest  in Spanish per se—he knew not a word of the language. But  he did realize the importance of Spanish for the University of  Miami, and as the years passed the Spanish collection became  something of a hobby with him. He made gifts especially for  Spanish for many years, amounting to something like $15,000  eventually. He used to come over to the University and ask me  "what we have been buying lately" and I would show him the  new volumes, with the bookplate "Gift of Frances and Meyer  Gold." One day he told me he wanted us to have "the best  Spanish library in the U.S." I explained that this was not possible: the term was not very meaningful, and anyway we had  started too late; with a huge expenditure our embryonic library  could eventually become unique in some special field of Spanish;  it would take a lot of time. This discouraged him. He was used  to working with collections in business and economics, but he  was not familiar with the quite different problems of building a  collection in a field like Spanish, with the vast coverage necessary.2 Soon he began to think of working in other areas. He was  already interested in the drama department collection. What  about a business library? Of this, more later. Now, a little about  Meyer Gold himself.  He was born in Poland on June 20, 1879. He came to the  U.S. when he was about seven years old. Growing up in New  York, he knew poverty and hunger. From his childhood, he  worked by day and attended school by night. What kind of  work he did at first I do not know, but as a young man he was  a bookkeeper for a brokerage house; later, he became a margin  clerk for Hirsch & Co. He began to save money and to invest  for himself. It was a humble beginning, but eventually Meyer  Gold was a member of the New York Curb Market (now the  21 shall discuss Mr. Gold's contribution to the Spanish collection in more detail  in The Carrell for June 1970. 	asu06600000200004001							65943300 Bytes	3857	5697	2589947631	RGB	8	600	asu06600000200004001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/816	816	817.jp2	/asu0660/image/817.jp2
Meyer Gold					Owre, J. Riis																											asu0660000020	American Stock Exchange), and enjoyed a reputation as an outstanding market analyst and financial advisor to many corporations. Here was the old story of the immigrant who prospered:  the proper combination of energy, ability, and willingness to  labor. Meyer Gold was one of the most talented men in his field  at the time; and he was known as a man of integrity. So conscientious was he that he refused to give financial advice to friends;  changing conditions might change his views, and he might  forget to tell the friend. Several times I asked him for advice on  investments; he pointed out to me how to study the market, and  how to reach decisions; but he would make none for me, nor  comment specifically on mine. For him, finance and friendship  were not to be mixed.  On reaching the age of twenty-one, Meyer Gold became an  American citizen. This must have been an important moment  for him, I am sure. He was a patriotic person, imbued with a  great love of the country which had given him his chance. On  the desk in his study, there stood always a small American flag.  On October 5, 1923, he married Frances Schwartz, a native  Chicagoan, who then resided in New York City. The couple  made their home there until 1937. Then they moved to Coral  Gables, buying a home on North Greenway Drive. Here they  lived rather quietly. They had many friends, and entertained  occasionally. They both played golf. Each business day, Mr.  Gold went for a couple of hours to a broker's office in Miami,  to watch developments in the stock market. Almost every day,  too, he worked strenuously in his garden. He interested himself  in the experimental work on various tropical fruits which was  being done then at the University's South Campus.  Mr. and Mrs. Gold had their favorite charities and good  works, of which they spoke little. Increasingly, they took an  interest in the University of Miami—"our University," they  called it. As the years passed, Frances Gold's health declined  and they saw fewer of their friends, living almost entirely to  themselves. By the time Meyer Gold died (August 17, 1960),  Frances was a helpless invalid. She survived until October  5, 1964.

Meyer Gold					Owre, J. Riis																											asu0660000020	These are the bare facts in the lives of two people, but they  do not tell the story; they say little of the great human feeling of  these two, of the rare qualities for which their friends remember  them.  Once, in Meyer Gold's youth, he had no place to go for  Christmas dinner except the Salvation Army. He never forgot  that, and in his later years he gave the Army $500 each Christmas, to provide dinners for the needy and homeless. They both  liked to provide Christmas cheer. It was in 1940, I believe,  that they set up a sumptuous Christmas dinner for a number  of the Royal Air Force cadets who were then in navigation training at the University. Most of these homesick young men had  been invited to Coral Gables homes for the occasion, but a  number—about a score, if my memory serves—had not. So the  Golds arranged for them to have dinner together in a private  room at the Coral Gables Country Club—but they themselves  did not go. "They will be more at ease by themselves," Frances  said. "If we went, it would just be for them to thank us and that  would be embarrassing."  One of my most cherished memories is that of a few words  with Meyer Gold one evening in 1943, when I had just received  my Navy commission. He asked me to come out to talk to him  —he always liked to talk seriously in a garden. His words moved  me so deeply that even now I can recall them almost exactly.  "You are a young man and you are going to war. I am an old  man and I have nothing to offer my country but money. I want  you to know that if your wife has any sudden needs while you  are gone, she can call on Frances and me for any amount. I  want you to feel that your family is secure while you are away."  I suppose nothing like this will ever happen to me again. Meyer  Gold would not have wanted me to tell it; but I can think of  nothing that shows better the thoughtful kindness that his sometimes brusque manner concealed. I am sure that other friends  remember similar incidents.  After the War the University of Miami developed with almost  incredible vigor, and Mr. Gold found this exciting. He supported  several activities at the South Campus, particularly work on red  guavas and on tangelos. He helped build up the drama library, 	asu06600000200006001							67152996 Bytes	3912	5720	139799876	RGB	8	600	asu06600000200006001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/818	818	819.jp2	/asu0660/image/819.jp2
Meyer Gold					Owre, J. Riis																											asu0660000020	and he and Frances were original "Members of the Ring Theatre." He also contributed to the building funds for the Ashe and  Merrick buildings. He gave sizable sums for medical research.  Gradually, the support of education became a passion with  Meyer Gold. Schooling had been a struggle for him; he had  never attended a university and I doubt that he had finished  high school. He had, really, educated himself, and he had done  a good job. When I knew him, he read widely, and his comments on his reading—like his comments on men— were  shrewd, original, perceptive. Now, he was wealthy enough to  indulge his passion; he could help others to educate themselves.  No one had helped him. . . Many students, I know, were the  recipients of his aid. But he did not keep records of this, and  he spoke little of it.  Above all, it was books which excited Meyer Gold most. The  library seemed to him the center of the educational process; and  it is his contributions to several libraries for which he will be  especially remembered, on this Florida campus and elsewhere.  Three institutions were of particular interest to him: New York  University, the Technion in Haifa, Israel, and the University of  Miami. At New York University, there was a close friend, Professor Jules Bogen, who gave advice on building the business library  of that institution, which received large contributions. Professor Bogen was also sent to Israel to report on the needs of the  Technion; and that institution also received significant support.  Mr. Gold liked the direct approach; he was a man of few  words. There is a delightful story of how he called on the president of the American Technion Society (to whom he was a  total stranger), took him to lunch, asked him a lot of questions  about the Haifa Technion, and suddenly handed him a cheque for  $10,000.3 (This was before Professor Bogen went to Haifa, I  believe.) It is characteristic of Meyer Gold that he went to the  luncheon well prepared. His guest was amazed at how much he  knew about the Technion. It is also characteristic that he did  not bother to speak of himself. That did not seem important  to him.  3"$1,000,000 bequeathed by Meyer Gold Estate" in Technion Review, Summer of  1965, pp. 3-4. 	asu06600000200007001							67486424 Bytes	3915	5744	1971339975	RGB	8	600	asu06600000200007001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/819	819	820.jp2	/asu0660/image/820.jp2
Meyer Gold					Owre, J. Riis																											asu0660000020	I  Mr. Gold soon began to concentrate on the business library  at the University of Miami. He contributed generously to what  was now called the "Gold Fund," stating that he wanted to see  this library the equal of other great business libraries in the U.S.,  such as that of the Wharton School. A faculty committee was set  up to supervise book selection, and the library burgeoned. The  practical effects were not slow in appearing. In 1957, when the  American Association of Collegiate Schools of Business instituted  a program for the accreditation of graduate programs in business, the University of Miami was among the first group approved. The dean of the School of Business Administration  wrote to Mr. Gold: "One of the largest single factors . . . was  the excellence of our library . . . [And] our library is largely the  creation of Meyer Gold."4 This must have been a great satisfaction to one who was always impatient for results.  Later, at Mr. Gold's request, outside experts were invited to  evaluate the work of the faculty committee, and he had additional  evidence that his purpose was being accomplished. Edward T.  Coman, Jr., librarian of the University of California (Riverside),  and a recognized authority on business libraries, reported on  April 13, 1959:  The School of Business Library of the University of Miami  has made excellent progress in building toward a distinguished  business library. The Gold Fund purchases have made possible  the strengthening of weak spots and the laying of a firm foundation of essential materials. If the development of the collection continues along present lines . . . this business collection  should soon rank with the important libraries in the field.5  A second report by Mr. Coman about a year later showed that  progress continued:  From the point of view of general usefulness and support  of the program of the School of Business, this collection now  compares very favorably with those of the older and larger  schools of business.6  In December, 1959, a survey by Laurence J. Kipp, Associate  Librarian of the Harvard School of Business, echoed these find-  4 Letter, Grover A. J. Noetzel to Meyer Gold, dated May 7, 1957.

Riis																											asu0660000020	ings and made valuable suggestions for future development.7  When Frances Gold died, in 1964, it was revealed that her  husband's entire estate (which had been left in trust for her),  and most of her own estate, were to go to the three educational  institutions which the two had supported for so many years:  twenty per cent to New York University, thirty to the Technion,  and fifty percent to the University of Miami. Mr. Gold's will  stated ". . . the purpose of creating a Meyer Gold Memorial  Library Fund ... to be principally used for the benefit of the  School of Business Administration." The income from the fund  was—and is—to be used principally for purchase of business  publications, but provision was also made for the expenditure of  a limited portion of the principal "in the event that technological  advances introduce new types of equipment, machinery, or  similar devices for use in business education." The objectives  of the donor were emphasized: "It shall always be borne in  mind that my major purpose in establishing the Meyer Gold  Memorial Library Fund is to ensure that the School of Business  Administration of the University of Miami has the means to  obtain the latest and best library facilities for the education of  the students ... so that the facilities available to them will continue in the front rank of schools of business in the United  States."  •       •       •  Meyer Gold will always be counted among the major contributors to the growth of the University of Miami. For many  years—"lean" years when supporters of the institution were not  numerous—he gave support that was effective, loyal, and encouraging; encouraging, particularly, because of its recognition  of the potential and promise of the University.  Meyer Gold's monetary contribution was in the neighborhood  of two million dollars, but this does not really tell what he did  for the University. Future generations of students will be in his  debt, always. His gifts were wise and good; they will continue to  grow in significance, and to bear good fruit—like the trees he  loved to plant.  7Ms report in Library archives, dated December 11, 1959.  wmmmrngmmm 	asu06600000200009001							66470580 Bytes	3905	5672	3298268180	RGB	8	600	asu06600000200009001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/821	821	822.jp2	/asu0660/image/822.jp2
Constance Fenimore Woolson: First Novelist of Florida					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000020	Constance Fenimore Woolson:  First Novelist of Florida  Evelyn Thomas Helmick  IN THE Atlantic Monthly of 1875 appeared a series of  papers called "An English Sportsman in Florida," describing this exotic peninsula in precise detail. Such description  was not a novelty, for men had written accounts of their journeys  into Florida from the beginning of its exploration: the list includes Sidney Lanier, John James Audubon, John Bartram,  Jonathan Dickinson; it reaches back to Cabeza de Vaca's Ad-  ventures in the Unknown Interior of America published in 1555.  But immediately preceding the English sportsman's article in  that March 13 issue of the Atlantic was something truly new in  literature—a short story with a Florida setting. The significant  fiction of the state, in fact, begins with the author of that story,  Constance Fenimore Woolson, who captured in novels, short  stories, and poems the genius loci of northern Florida.1 The  Florida fiction is the best work of a writer highly praised in her  day by such critics as Henry James and William Dean Howells  and judged as late as 1929 "one of the finest novelists that America thus far has produced."2  Miss Woolson—or Fenimore, as her friend Henry James called her and as her great-uncle, James Fenimore Cooper had  been called—began to publish in national periodicals in 1870  with stories of the Lake Country near Cleveland, where her  family had moved a few months after her birth in New Hampshire in 1840. Her first collection of stories (after the prize-  winning Old Stone House for children) was Castle Nowhere:  Lake Country Sketches in 1875. Before that time, however, she  and her mother and sister had begun to spend much of each  year in St. Augustine, with frequent visits to the Carolinas, Tennessee, and Georgia. From this experience came her second collection, Rodman the Keeper: Southern Sketches, in 1880. After  her mother's death she sailed for Europe, where she lived  in Italy and England, producing an astonishing number of books  before she died in 1896. These works include the novels Anne,  •  8 	asu06600000200010001							65572824 Bytes	3857	5665	3289751622	RGB	8	600	asu06600000200010001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/822	822	823.jp2	/asu0660/image/823.jp2

As the titles of the story collections indicate and even a cursory  examination of the novels reveals, Miss Woolson was fascinated  with places. And through the whole of her life, the place that  seemed to mean most to her was Florida. Soon after she arrived  in St. Augustine in 1873, she wrote to a friend:  The life here is so fresh, so new, so full of certain wild freedom. I walk miles through the hummocks, where it looks as  though no one had ever walked before, gathering wild flowers  everywhere, or sitting down under the pine trees to rest in the  shade . . . You know the ocean is new to me and I am so fond  of it already that I feel as if I never cared to go inland any  more.3  Her admiration for the area continued undiminished during her  residence there, so that she could write to her literary mentor,  Edmund Clarence Stedman, just a month after her arrival in  Europe that she wanted to return to Florida to live as soon  as possible:  I am only waiting to store up a little more money; then I shall  return; buy a wee cottage down there; set up a crane and three  orange-trees; & never stir again.4  No wonder, then, that some of her most vital work sprang from a  Florida background.  Her earliest writing about the state appeared in verse form  in Harper's Magazine, Galaxy, and Appletoris Journal soon  after she settled in St. Augustine. The poems, written in careful  rhythm and rhyme and full of inversion and nineteenth-century  poetic diction, nevertheless evoke some remarkable pictures. The  fourth stanza of "Pine Barrens," is one example:  Abroad upon the Barrens the saw-palmetto reddens  The ground with armed ranks that firm for centuries have  stood;  They kneel and pray to Heaven that their sins may be forgiven,  Their long green knives in readiness, bold outlaws of the  wood! 	asu06600000200011001							66792576 Bytes	3904	5701	855798344	RGB	8	600	asu06600000200011001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/823	823	824.jp2	/asu0660/image/824.jp2
Constance Fenimore Woolson: First Novelist of Florida					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000020	That the pine barrens were more than mere landscape to her is  apparent in the last stanza of "The Florida Beach":  Alone, alone, we wander through  The southern winter day.  The ocean spreads his mighty blue,  The world is far away:  The tide comes in,—the birds fly low,  As if to catch our speech—  Ah Fate! why must we ever go  From the beautiful Florida Beach?  Other descriptive poems about the Florida landscape, all published between 1874 and 1876, are "Yellow Jessamine," "The  Ancient City," and "The Ocklawaha." "Dolores" is a narrative  poem about a Minorcan woman and a surgeon in the Union  Army who saves her child.5  Miss Woolson soon turned to short stories as the way to relate  her Florida experience, a fortunate change because of her greater  skill and originality in prose than in poetry. There are four  stories with north Florida settings,6 and they grow progressively  more permeated with a sense of the mystery of the natural surroundings and of the role of environment in men's lives. "Miss  Elisabetha" is the story of a proud northern spinster who rears  her lover's son to be a gentleman in the town of Beata along  the Warra River. Two other women challenge her for control  of Theodore; Miss Elisabetha is victorious over the prima donna  who wants to teach him opera in Europe, but is defeated by the  beautiful, uneducated Minorcan girl who marries him, provides  him with a large brood of lazy, ignorant, happy children, and  sends him to an early death. They tolerantly regard Miss Elisabetha, who tirelessly works in the household, as a "species differing from theirs, but good in its way, especially for work."  Here is Miss Woolson's constantly recurring theme of the way  in which men's origins confer certain life-long character traits.  The Minorcan character is treated again in "Felipa," a story  of a wild southern child who falls in love with a northerner and  tries to kill both herself and him when she learns of his impending marriage to a northern woman.

Constance Fenimore Woolson: First Novelist of Florida					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000020	em and southern temperaments is important in the next Florida  story Miss Woolson wrote, "Sister St. Luke." Pedro, a lighthouse  keeper, is married to Malvyna, a New England woman, whom  his Minorcan friends and relatives regard as a "woman of wonder  —of an energy unfathomable." Even her seven-year-old New  England bonnet is trimmed with a "durable" green ribbon and  a "vigorous" wreath of artificial flowers. The characterization of  Pedro and Malvyna provides most of the interest in the story,  whose plot focuses on the heroism during a storm of Sister Luke,  a timid nun from a nearby convent who is nursed by Malvyna  during an illness.  The most powerful of the Florida short stories without doubt  is "The South Devil," which moves quickly toward the skillful-  ness of the novels, and which contains the germs of the themes  developed more fully in them. Contrast between the northern  and southern character is central to the plot. Mark Deal, a  northerner, works from daylight until dusk ("and was probably  the only white man in the State who did") to create order and  beauty in his plaza and to care for his southern step-brother  Carl, whom he has only recently met. Carl sleeps most of the day,  works not at all, and gambles away Mark's savings in one card  game. But his strongest and strangest vice is an attraction to the  evils of the South Devil, the poisonous cypress swamp nearby.  Mark's two excursions into the swamp to rescue Carl give Miss  Woolson an opportunity to display her powers of description.  They passed under the gray and solemn cypresses, rising without branches to an enormous height, their far foliage hidden  by the moss, which hung down thickly in long flakes, diffusing  the sunshine and making it silvery like mist; in the silver swung  the air-plants, great cream-colored disks, and wands of scarlet,  crowded with little buds, blossoms that looked like butterflies,  and blossoms that looked like humming-birds, and little dragonheads with grinning faces. Then they came to the region of the  palms; these shot up, slender and graceful, and leaned over the  stream the great aureum ferns growing on their trunks high in  the air. Beneath was a firmer soil than in the domain of the  cypresses, and here grew a mat of little flowers, each less than  a quarter of an inch wide, close together, pink, blue, scarlet,  yellow, purple, but never white, producing a hue singularly rich,  owing to the absence of that colorless color which man ever  mingles with his floral combinations, and strangely makes  sacred alike to the bridal and to death . . .

The atmosphere was hot, and heavy with perfumes. It was the heart of the swamp, a riot of intoxicating,  steaming, swarming, fragrant, beautiful, tropical life, without  man to make or mar it. All the world was once so, before man  was made. (pp. 191-192)  Her ambivalent feelings toward the tropical land, so prominent  in the novels, begin to become apparent in this tale, even slightly  in the description of the swamp. The end of the passage quoted  reveals another of Miss Woolson's themes: the awareness of  the long history of the Florida peninsula. One paragraph of  "The South Devil" prods the reader into an immediate awareness  of that history; as Mark notices fifty-year-old furrows in his field,  the author comments:  There are many such traces of former cultivation in Florida;  we come suddenly upon old tracks, furrows, and drains in  what we thought primeval forest; rose-bushes run wild and distorted old fig-trees meet us in a jungle where we supposed no  white man's foot had ever before penetrated; the ruins of a  chimney gleam whitely through a waste of thorny chaparral. It  is all natural enough, if one stops to remember that fifty years  before the first settlement was made in Virginia, and sixty-three  before the Mayflower touched the shores of the New World,  there were flourishing Spanish plantations on this Southern  coast,—more flourishing apparently, than any the indolent  peninsula has since known. But one does not stop to remember  it; the belief is imbedded in all our Northern hearts that because  the narrow, sun-bathed State is far away and wild and empty,  it is also new and virgin, like the lands of the West; whereas it  is old,—the only gray-haired corner our country holds, (p. 175)  The consciousness of the past and of the beauties of the unspoiled  land are two ever-relevant themes for readers of Miss Woolson's  fiction. A final theme of "The South Devil," one recurring frequently in her stories, is consummately Victorian and dates her  work for the contemporary reader. The idea of sacrifice, often  to no purpose, appears again and again. In this last Florida short  story, Carl takes a fatal walk through the swamp to post a  letter, thinking perhaps he can redeem his worthless life by informing his cousin that Mark loves her. Often such sacrifices  seem to be made only to prove strength of character.  Such unattractive, if not improbable, martyrs are perhaps  part of the reason Miss Woolson's work is seldom read today.  •   12 	asu06600000200014001							66388292 Bytes	3905	5665	1164788748	RGB	8	600	asu06600000200014001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/826	826	827.jp2	/asu0660/image/827.jp2
Constance Fenimore Woolson: First Novelist of Florida					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000020	The problems with her books are undoubtedly those characteristics which made them popular in her own day. Her characters, in exercising a restraint admirable to the Victorian mind,  seem wooden and unreal; the endless feminine analysis of  emotions and motivations becomes comic after a while; the plots  become too circumstantial to bear. If, however, the reader is  able to recognize and isolate the Victorian elements, as, for  example, a playgoer might recognize the conventions of British  comedy, he can still find much to enjoy and appreciate in a  Woolson novel. The humor alone often makes her stories worth  the reading. Much of her humor is very subtle, and mildly malicious, as in her description of Felicite, the French woman, who  looked as though she would like to be wicked. "In reality, however, she was harmless, for one insatiable ambition within her  swallowed up all else, namely, the ambition not to be middle-  aged. As she was forty-eight, the struggle took all her time."  (p. 228) Another example in the same novel, Horace Chase,  is the party given by a local St. Augustine do-gooder for the  Indians held prisoner at Fort St. Marco. The company commander has wisely chosen only six of the Indians for the party,  and the hostess tries to convert them.  "If I could only speak to them in their own tongue!" she said,  yearningly. And the long sentences, expressive of friendship,  which she begged the interpreter to translate to them, would  have filled a volume. The interpreter, a very intelligent young  man, obeyed all her requests with much politeness. "Tell them  then we love them," said Mrs. Kip. "Tell them that we think of  their souls.''9  The interpreter bowed; then he translated as follows: "The  white squaw says that you have had enough to eat, and more  than enough; and she hopes that you won't make pigs of yourselves if anything else is offered—especially Drowning Raven!  (pp. 183-184)  The reader who values a subtle wit, or one frequently not so  subtle, will find much in Woolson.  But her real accomplishment is in her evocation of that  sense of place that is an accomplishment confined to a few:  Thomas Hardy with the heaths of England, Sarah Orne Jewett  with Vermont, Willa Gather with Nebraska, and Marjorie Kin-  nan Rawlings with rural Florida.

Such scenes as the  annual search for the first jessamine in early St. Augustine not  only add flavor to her novels, but serve to reinforce both character and structure, as Hardy's Egdon Heath so often does. The  Florida settings in two novels—East Angels entirely and Horace  Chase in part—control the characters, the action, the morality,  the tone of the stories. Miss Woolson, so often labeled a local  eolorist, does much more than skilfully describe an unknown  region. For her, a sense of place pervades every area of life.  True, by the time of East Angels of 1886 and Horace Chase  of 1894, her powers of descriptive writing are developed fully  enough to be pleasurable in themselves. She can describe the  movements of a character in East Angels:  He went to look at some camellias, whose glossy leaves formed  a thicket at a little distance; on the other side of this thicket he  discovered a crape-myrtle avenue, the delicate trees so choked  and hustled by the ruder foliage which had grown up about  them that they stood like captives in the midst of a rabble,  broken-hearted and dumb. (pp. 48-49)  She is able to weave her descriptions into the very fabric  of her story without intrusion upon the action or change in  pace. A trip in a canoe from East Angels, for example, shows  her skill:  Lightly it sped out towards deep water, the slightest motion sent  it forward; its sides were of such slender thickness that the two  men could feel the breathing of the great soft stream, which  had here a breadth of three miles, though in sight, both above  and below, it widened into six. These broad water stretches  were tranquil; from shore to shore the slow, full current swept  majestically on; and even to look across the wide, still reaches,  with the tropical forests standing thickly on their low strands,  was a vision of peace for the most troubled human soul.  Kildee plover flew chattering before the canoe while they  were still near land. Far above in the blue a bald-headed eagle  sailed along. Lanse chose to go out to the centre of the stream  —Lanse never skirted the edge of anything; reaching it, he  turned southward, and they voyaged onward for nearly an  hour. (p. 410)  Such scenes interested northern readers of 1886, many of  whom, like one of the characters in East Angels, must have  supposed there was nothing worth their personal consideration  south of Philadelphia.  •   14  _ 	asu06600000200016001							67255884 Bytes	3929	5704	4081646376	RGB	8	600	asu06600000200016001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/828	828	829.jp2	/asu0660/image/829.jp2
Constance Fenimore Woolson: First Novelist of Florida					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000020	With her two Florida novels, both popularly and critically acclaimed, Miss Woolson was able to capture the interest of northerners in the state. The novels, like the stories, are conventional  and somewhat sentimental in characterization and plot. East  Angels tells of the romances and marriages of two women: the  shallow southerner Garda Thorne who marries unthinkingly  twice, the second time to a Spaniard whom she respects little, and  the patient, noble northerner Margaret Harold who stands by  a husband even after he has deserted her twice, although she  loves another man. Horace Chase, only partly set in Florida,  is the story of a young woman married to an older successful  man. When a younger colleague encourages her infatuation, it  is the husband who sacrifices his pride after a near-indiscretion  confessed by his wife. It would seem nearly impossible to make  such slim plots interest a reader in 1970; yet they do, chiefly  because Miss Woolson's appreciation of surroundings and her  insight into the relationship between place and character make  fascinating study.  Beyond her ability to describe clearly those exotic sights and  smells which intrigued her in Florida, she brings to the novels  careful observation of the groups of people she found there.  The Minorcans appear as colorful embodiments of an indolent,  sunny landscape. The southern Negroes, particularly in East  Angels, are carefully and attractively drawn. Their speech, at  times as incomprehensible in Miss Woolson's printed version as  it is aurally, has been called a "careful philological study." She  observed with care the new immigrants to Florida, sometimes  with admiration, sometimes with disdain, as in East Angels:  This new class counted within its ranks at present the captains  and crews of the northern schooners that were beginning to  come into that port for lumber; the agents of land-companies  looking after titles and the old Spanish grants; speculators with  plans in their pockets for railways, with plans in their pockets  for canals, with plans in their pockets and sometimes very little  else) for draining the swamps and dredging the Everglades,  many of the schemes dependent upon aid from Congress, and  mysteriously connected with the new negro vote. In addition  there were the first projectors of health resorts, the first northern buyers of orange groves: in short, the pioneers of that busy,  practical American majority ...

Constance Fenimore Woolson: First Novelist of Florida					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000020	Of special interest to the modern reader is Miss Woolson's  wide knowledge of Florida history. Her awareness of the region's  past expressed in "The South Devil" pervades most of her southern stories. In "Sister St. Luke" the structure of a lighthouse affords the opportunity to tell the history of Pelican Island as each  alteration and addition to the lighthouse is analyzed. In East  Angels the tracing of a deed back to the original Spanish settlers becomes an informative lesson. Miss Woolson tries to make  the reader as conscious of Florida's history as is Evert Winthrop  in that novel:  There was—he could not deny it—a certain comparative antiquity about this southern peninsula which had in it more  richness of color and a deeper perspective than that possessed  by any of the rather blank, near, little backgrounds of American history farther north. This was a surprise to him. Like  most New Englanders, he had unconsciously cherished the belief that all there was of historical importance, of historical  picturesqueness even, in the beginnings of the republic, was  associated with the Puritans from whom he was on his father's  side descended, was appended to their stately hats and ruffs,  their wonderful perseverance, their dignified orthography, the  solemnities of their speech and demeanor,  (p.  15)  In Horace Chase, the "ancient city," as Miss Woolson calls St.  Augustine, provides historical comment, with much focus on  Fort San Marco and the Indian past.  The Florida environment exerts its influence on the present  just as much in these novels. Miss Woolson's major theme in all  her southern work is the contrast between the northern and  southern temperaments. East Angels opens with a contrast between the regions and soon adapts the doctor's point of view:  "to him the difference between New England and the South was  as wide, whether considered geographically, psychologically, or  historically, as that between the South and Japan." The indolent,  sweet-natured Garda Thorne of that novel is a natural product  of the pine-barrens who lacks the fortitude to cope with adversity. Her mother, described by Henry James, as "the little  starved yet ardent daughter of the Puritans, who has been  condemned to spend her life in the land of the relaxed," expends  her dying breath in an attack on the region:  Oh! I so hate and loathe it all—the idle, unrealizing, contented  life of this tiresome, idle coast. They amounted to something  •   16 	asu06600000200018001							66473532 Bytes	3899	5681	2541562213	RGB	8	600	asu06600000200018001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/830	830	831.jp2	/asu0660/image/831.jp2

They don't know it; you couldn't make them believe it even if  you should try. That is what makes you rage—they're so completely mistaken and so completely satisfied! (p. 219)  Florida is variously referred to in these stories as the land of the  lotus eaters, the land of the alligators, and "this miserable little  half-afloat land." And its shortcomings affect its inhabitants. In  Horace Chase, the infatuation of the young wife Ruth occurs in  St. Augustine "by fatality." Her comment that the winter in that  town was the happiest of her life is ironic, since her infatuation  destroys both her health and her happiness. In East Angels, Evert  Winthrop behaves impulsively during a ride through the Monn-  lungs swamp and declares that a man is not responsible for his  actions in such a place.  Miss Woolson's ambivalence makes her observations of Florida more interesting than unmitigated praise might. Perhaps she  was trying for the balance of a Thomas Hardy, whom she admired as a writer and of whom she wrote, "his landscapes have  no moral meanings." Her final personal judgment appears in a  letter to Stedman from Europe in 1877:  I hardly appreciated myself, until I was separated from it, how  much I loved that warm hazy peninsula where I spent five long  happy winters . . .  Her admiration was combined with her skill to capture a spirit  of early Florida which we might otherwise never know.

Yeats: What Method? An Approach to the Performance of the Plays					Johnson, Josephine																											asu0660000020	Yeats: What Method? An Approach  to the Performance of the Plays.  Josephine Johnson  On Tuesday, May 9th, 1899, The Irish Times lambasted  W. B. Yeats's The Countess Cathleen as follows: "It is not a play.  It is without action, without definiteness in characterization, without consistency in the dramatic development, without truth in  its reflection or Celtic temperament of life, and, like all inferior plays, it fails to excite the smallest genuine interest."  The critic failed to recognize Yeats's break with European  dramatic theory. In 1969 a play excites genuine interest without action: witness Harold Pinter's Landscape; without definiteness in characterization: behold Eugene Ionesco's The Bald  Soprano; with inconsistencies in dramatic development: Samuel  Beckett's Embers; while honest reflection still confuses the  common lot.  Nevertheless, seventy years after the performance of The  Countess Cathleen it remains fair game to challenge Yeats as  playwright, to cubbyhole him as Irish playing Japanese Mogul,  and worse, Anglo-Irish patronizing fairy myths all "covered up  with a lonely tune." Karl Shapiro declares him magus of a  Secret Lodge, Pope without power of a style which embodies  all the phoniness of the art: the creator of the poem as idol whose  ritual Yeats commands us to dance.1 George Brandon Saul defers  to Yeats in nine or ten of the plays but manages to brand the  delightful Cat and the Moon, for example, as a tiresome, fragmentary expository sketch, a pretentious triviality.2  Yet Yeats is not only the precursor of the best that happens  in twentieth century theatre, the theatre of the absurd, the  theatre of cruelty; he is a visionary in life and art who labours  long to be beautiful, and approaches in The Countess Cathleen  by chance and choice what he simplifies in later plays purely by  choice. How to interpret his choice is a particular problem in  performance: how to interpret indefiniteness of characterization,  how to play inconsistency in dramatic development is the point  of this inquiry.  19  • 	asu06600000200021001							66239616 Bytes	3848	5736	984042461	RGB	8	600	asu06600000200021001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/833	833	834.jp2	/asu0660/image/834.jp2
Yeats: What Method? An Approach to the Performance of the Plays					Johnson, Josephine																											asu0660000020	Vivian Mercier is correct when he writes that Yeats needs  directors who are humble and intelligent enough to read all that  he writes about production and who faithfully submit to his  wishes.3 But Yeats is oblique in his instructions and his sixty-  four word sentences reveal longing as well as regrets for his  design. "The players must move a little stiffly and gravely like  marionettes." "Where there are no words there is less to spoil:"  "the dancing will give me the most trouble, for I know but  vaguely what I want;" or referring to a certain composer's music  he has some "vague memory" of an anticipated score. And of  his musicians: "I think the great thing is to make everyone understand that we don't want professionally-trained singers but  the sort of people who sing when they are drunk or in love. I  think professional musicians have a corpse factory, mankind  melted down and poured out of a bottle."4  Yeat's ideas for performance are more reasonable to interpret  grounded in other frames of reference; his ideal programme for  his idea of the No, begun several years before he met Ezra  Pound, appears less remote in the company of other Asiatic and  European anti-naturalists. Unfortunately, the director blinded  by spiritual belief in "method" confronts these sources as helpless superstition, and especially with Yeats he sees his Noism as  an integrity like Crazy Jane's, one that nobody wants.5  The pattern for Yeats's style in all but five of the published  plays occurs in the Japanese theatre. There the audience attends  not to be moved by images made to resemble those occurring in  actuality but by images clearly distinguished from reality by  extraction from and manipulation of life. This contrived design  is theatre reality, its credibility not indebted to verisimilitude,  illusion or delusion, to imitation or representation, but to an  agreement between the performer and the audience that whatever is aesthetically valid is real. The audience comes without its  willing suspension of disbelief: it interprets and accepts the design of the play as a vision of life. Earle Ernst has an analogy  for this sort of theatre reality.6 He compares it to the bonsai, a  miniature tree which resembles a real tree only indirectly. The  artist fashions the design of the bonsai to its simplest, most direct form from nature, bending, manipulating and pruning it  •  20  is.rzz"* 	asu06600000200022001							67973952 Bytes	3944	5743	1172066715	RGB	8	600	asu06600000200022001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/834	834	835.jp2	/asu0660/image/835.jp2

Regard Yeats: "An action is taken out of all other  actions; it is reduced to its simplest form, or ... to as simple a  form as it can be brought to without our losing the sense of  its place in the world."7  Arthur Waley's description of the No suits Yeats's idea for  design which Yeats uses to transcend piddling, bourgeois human  characteristics. "The No does not make a frontal attack on the  emotions. It creeps at the subject warily."8 There is no possibility  of crude realities; a vision of life but painted with colours of  memory, longing and regret; and with the realization that material phenomena are thoughts, not facts.9 Look to Yeats's The  King's Threshold.10  Seami Motokiyo, fourteenth century master actor and playwright of the No, describes in his treatises exactly what Yeats instinctively outlines for his actors and musicians in performance.  The performer, above all else, must interpret the poet's vision  and not his own observations of life since the poet creates a  more perfect picture of nature than the actor sees in reality.  The No actor minimizes the activities of his ego11 in order that  he may interpret the poet's picture. He exchanges his subjective  identification with the character for an objective observation  explained through the poet's eyes which permits him to transform reality into art. He learns that he does not express individuality through the imitation of superficial characteristics because the poet perceives the identity of all men to exist in man's  sub-conscious mind:12 Jung's collective subconscious or Yeats's  Spiritus Mundi. The actor discards realistic characteristics of  character for more subtle imitation. Seami does not use the word  imitation in the Aristotelian sense, an imitation of an action;  but symbolizes by the word the theatre reality Ernst speaks of  in the analogy to the bonsai. Seami: "In imitation there should  be a tinge of the 'unlike.' For if imitation be pressed too far it  impinges on reality and ceases to give an impression of likeness."13 His qualification of unlikeness resembles the illustration  in the story about the young actor and the old woman that  Yeats found in the Fenalossa manuscripts.

If the actor notices that  old men walk with bent knees and back and shrunken frame,  and simply copies these actions, he does so at the expense of the  "flower."14 The flower is the quintessence of the actor's skill:  Yeats's "the wine breath". Compare Yeats's criticism of Florence  Fair's characterization of the nurse in The Hippolytus. "Why  do you play the part with bent back and a squeak in the voice . . .  you who belong to a life that is a vision?"15  Instead of imitating surface characteristics, the No actor  probes the "true intent" which is the core or the character's personality. For example, a frenzied man expresses mental derangement with gestures that are overt manifestations of his madness,  but the actor must interpret the obsession which causes the  madness and his knowledge and portrayal of the obsession or  the cause will be the true intent.16 Such wisdom, restraint, and  subtlety are necessities for an audience who is expected to withhold sympathy and to control emotion, and not to delight in  all things equally. Seami's audience finds time for repose and  for observation.  Yeats might have written the description of the perfect unity  of words and music that Seami explains. The musician achieves  the unity of sound indemic to the No by listening to the actor's  voice. He follows its rhythms, and its cadence (obviously different to Western line reading), and shadows it with notes which  have no independent existence as melody. The music is simply a  complement to the recitation and later to the dance at the moment when it becomes an outgrowth of speech. The dance expresses the thoughts beyond the conscious level of character for  what the protagonist wishes to express cannot be stated in logical  terms so that the word cannot symbolize it.17  Meanwhile, the drummers who with the flute players accompany the recitation and the chanting create an atmosphere  of tension with monotonous, rhythmic taps. Yeats borrows the  device for The Resurrection; here, the musician verbally imitates  the drum to indicate the tension created by the crowd who approach the building where Christ will appear. "Barrum, barrum,  barrum."  •  22 	asu06600000200024001							68573508 Bytes	4006	5704	3161899081	RGB	8	600	asu06600000200024001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/836	836	837.jp2	/asu0660/image/837.jp2
Yeats: What Method? An Approach to the Performance of the Plays					Johnson, Josephine																											asu0660000020	It is Oswald Sickert's description of the No, written in a letter  to Charles Ricketts18 that most nearly synthesizes the style  Yeats wants in performance. Sickert writes that No recitation  eliminates direct expressiveness. The chorus chants, the actors  intone but both are aware that it is the poem which is the important accomplishment. The performers express its meaning indirectly by a deliberate withdrawal from it. Compare Yeats's  words about the speaker of poetry who must be a messenger as  interesting and exciting as all purveyors of important news. He  speaks with a peculiar animation, never losing speech to song,  and his words, however impassioned, are always at a distance  from that which he describes. Thus he permits himself "every  kind of nobleness."19 The actor, Yeats is saying, describes passion more than he becomes it.  The Irish Times in 1899 had also called The Countess Cathleen a costume recital of a poem but The Irish Daily Independent  understood what Yeats wanted. "The great charm of the acting  was the manner in which the music of the poem was presented.  The rhythmic beat and cadence of the verse stole on the ears  like music sweetly played. And through it all ran the true dramatic fervour which gives force and passion to the words."  How unfaithfully Yeats interprets the structure and design  of the No is not relevant to his success as playwright, but what  he imagines as significant to it is, and must appear in performance. He does not understand how to choreograph the dance  but he knows that the dancer is the dance "immersion, of intellect in body, and character in ecstasy"; a moment too impassioned for words. He does not understand what he wants in  music and admits that although it impresses him he can no more  judge its quality than he can thunder. He senses the subtle No  combinations of instruments that add dimension to the verse  without destroying its rhythm and cadences but, accepts from  his composers music not suitable to his design, Antheil's and  Dulac's, for example. He does not reserve the mask for the  main player and his assistant, but distributes them at will to suggest images of "those profound emotions that exist only in  solitude and in silence": sensuousness under an impassioned  surface; more practically, to obscure the distorted grimaces of  23  • 	asu06600000200025001							66207448 Bytes	3865	5708	622021335	RGB	8	600	asu06600000200025001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/837	837	838.jp2	/asu0660/image/838.jp2

Yeats does understand that he wants actors  who are perfectly in possession of themselves and whose speaking of passionate words describes character at a fixed moment  in time. He writes: "We must get rid of everything that is restless, everything that draws attention away from the sound of  voice, or from the few moments of intense expression, whether  that expression is through the voice or through the hands; we  must from time to time substitute for the moments that the eye  sees the nobler movements that the heart sees, the rhythmical  movements that seem to flow up into the imagination from  some deeper life than that of the individual soul."20  Obviously the actor is at an impasse when he reads that he  must describe character more than become it, speak passionate  words but contain his passion, stand at a distance from that  which absorbs him. And if the words are more important than  the motivation necessary to build character, how does he apply  the "method." Stanislavsky's belief that only art that was immersed in human, personalized experience could reproduce  the impalpable shadings and depths of life necessary to absorb  the audience but slightly fits Yeats's poetic vision. To reproduce feelings, Stanislavsky said, the actor must be able to  identify them out of his own experience. With this process of  identification Stanislavsky's play becomes a theatrical reality,  but unlike the No, a mirror of life as the actor sees it and not  a poet's design. Stanislavsky asks his actors and audience not  only for empathy but total subjective commitment. Vision obscured by emotion: art beggared by life. Yeats's refusal to accept this theatre is not isolated from other mainstreams of  European thought. Meyerhold, Copeau, Dullin are a few of  those who reject Stanislavsky's theatre of intimate involvement,  and not the least of the dissenters is the playwright Bertold Brecht.  In 1926 Brecht might write the prologue for The Death of  Cuchulain. "I aim at [a] highly intellectual style of performance;  I'm not writing for the scum who want to have the cockles of  their hearts warmed"21 is tongue away from Yeats's "opinionated  bitches." True that Brecht's development of alienation (the  actors' and audiences' ability to qualitatively observe their emotion through reason) stems from political necessity more than  •  24  V  '..     * 	asu06600000200026001							66700184 Bytes	3902	5696	1125944204	RGB	8	600	asu06600000200026001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/838	838	839.jp2	/asu0660/image/839.jp2
Yeats: What Method? An Approach to the Performance of the Plays					Johnson, Josephine																											asu0660000020	it is true that Yeats's stress for remoteness exists to revive romantic Ireland. The importance of the comparison is not within  their nationalistic objectives but within their artistic methods  for achieving style.  Brecht: "We need to get right away from the old naturalistic  school of acting. . . The actor doesn't have to be the man he  portrays. . . Nobody gets raped by character. . . He has to describe his character just as he would be described in a book,"  and like the Chinese actor, "he expresses his awareness of being  watched. . . . [This] does not in any way demand an unnatural  way of acting. . . The actor does not allow himself to become  completely transformed into the character he is portraying. He  is not Lear .... Actors will know what it means if I say that a  typical kind of acting without this complete transformation  takes place when a producer or colleague shows one how to  play a particular passage. He is not his own part, so he is  not completely transformed."22  Closing the door to empathy Brecht believes that spectator  and actor ought not to approach one another but to move apart.  The spectator never loses himself in the character completely.  He is not "fobbed off" with an invitation to identify with the  hero. Describing, for example, the servant's reaction to her  mistress's suicide in a production of Oedipus he writes; "She did  not abandon her voice to horror, but perhaps her face, for she  used white make-up to show the impact which a death makes  on all who are present at it." Contrast, he says, this gesture  to the actor who plunges himself and his audience in self identification; they become lost in the protagonist's feelings. Observe  Yeats's use of dialogue for the Blind Man in On Baile's Strand  when he receives the news of Cuchulain's fate. "There will be  nobody in the houses. Come this way; come quickly! The ovens  will be full. . ."  Brecht's theatre directs itself to a more sober, sachlich aesthetic than Yeats's. It is Hindemith more than Debussy: Grosz,  Beckmann, intead of Burne-Jones and Rosetti. But neither innovator denies emotion; Brecht contains it in sober discovery,  Yeats uses it for withdrawal and not for sympathy.  25  • 	asu06600000200027001							66304776 Bytes	3870	5709	712602886	RGB	8	600	asu06600000200027001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/839	839	840.jp2	/asu0660/image/840.jp2
Yeats: What Method? An Approach to the Performance of the Plays					Johnson, Josephine																											asu0660000020	Seami and Brecht illuminate Yeats's method for performance:  the subtlety of recitation, the actor's description of character;  whether their practicum functions, remains.  Calvary, a synthesis of Yeats's so-called broken action and  characters drawn in late Picasso line, suits the discussion. The  play is often second in choice to The Resurrection which critics  qualify the stronger of the two. It is stronger only because it is  less fragile; and since the ideas are dissimilar in the significance  of the Christs the choice is questionable. One critic would find  the protagonist in Calvary neither "full-bodied nor red-blooded,"23 and another wonders why Yeats concerns himself with  a Christ as a dramatic figure whose sympathy necessary to insight is lacking. Moreover, he questions the "loaded" reading  of Lazarus.24 Calvary was directed by James Flannery at a  Dublin Theatre festival and the production later recorded by  him.25 This is how he appraises the play. He finds its form  too static for a Western audience, the words not vital enough  to hold their attention, much less to move them. The eye to the  audience is Flannery's first mistake. If the director interprets  a play with the audience in mind instead of the text, he must  produce a distorted image of the author's work. Flannery admits that from an acting standpoint he directed possibly the  first Stanislavskian production of Yeats ever attempted. Rather  than pursue the remoteness that Yeats sought to establish by  mask and stylized movement Flannery attracts the audience's  attention through full-bodied characterization, and also represents characters on stage whose physical presence is not indicated  in the script. His concern with the audience's withdrawal during  the musical interludes in the play logically induces him to portray  the mockers and the Holy Women. The mockers, for example,  become so motivated during the Soldiers' dance that they  strip Christ of his clothes. Flannery attempts to actualize suggestion, to bring forward the dreaming-back. Obviously he attempts to create visually what he believes Yeats cannot do  verbally. The actors are spared the challenge of standing away  from character; the audience is denied the opportunity to imagine  and to reflect, it is welcomed into the arena of naturalism.

A doomed figure, unable to preserve his love and hence  his life in Judas and Lazarus who represent lonely, subjective  man; unable to share nature's earthly passions with the soldiers,  or those who have no need for his compassion, he realizes his  moment only in the love he shares with the weak, the Holy  Women, or those who represent the need for a cause in life or  an object for self-realization.  The drama occurs in Christ's dream during which he relives  his Agony. The dream supposes a perpetual purgatory; he is a  Christ not expected to rise again. Lazarus and Judas enter this  dream in agons which are quarrels with their own beings more  than with Christ's for understanding does not accompany his  love. Lazarus claims Christ's death for his own to preserve the  spiritual and intellectual isolation of death denied him in Christ's  gift of unwanted, perpetual life. Judas despairs at the frustration  of a life determinism which denies him even the choice of  betrayal. "You cannot even save me" derrogates Christ as the  puppet son who must play out the irreversible will of his Father.  Christ is reduced to a pawn, his life proves little, his death less.  The play is a vision of man's eternal quarrel with himself in a  creation he cannot control. To interpret it only as a confrontation  with dogma would make of it rhetoric, not poetry. The action  moves steadily toward the epiphanic dance symbolizing the crucifixion. The pattern suggests the nonverbal gesture of the Japanese  when made to deny Christianity: he trod on a religious image.27  At no point does the chorus suppress the action, as Flannery  reads the play. The refrain throughout the songs confirms from  the beginning that the insufficient Christ will be unable to communicate with those he wants most to convince. The first song  describes man's narcissistic preoccupation with himself while  27  • 	asu06600000200029001							66761740 Bytes	3889	5720	67526679	RGB	8	600	asu06600000200029001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/841	841	842.jp2	/asu0660/image/842.jp2

The crescent moon or nature's cyclical rebirth shall  determine his fate.  The song which concludes the play contrasts man's intellectual  and sexual satisfactions to Christ's Agony;  Lonely the sea-bird lies at her rest,  Blown like a dawn-blenched parcel of spray  Upon the wind, or follows her prey  Under a great wave's hollowing crest.  God has not appeared to the birds.  The ger-eagle has chosen his part  In blue deep of the upper air  Where one-eyed day can meet his stare;  He is content with his savage heart.  And finally the musicians express the unchristian choice, freedom from life through eternal death.  But where have last year's cygnets gone?  The lake is empty; why do they fling  White wing out beside white wing?  What can a swan need but a swan?  The verses sing and question man's release as well as God's  useless sacrifice. "God has not appeared to the birds."  The director who approaches Calvary with vision instead of  revision will touch upon the simplicity of style so implicit in the  play. The ideas are revealed by evocation and not by statement;  the actor does not create character as much as he expresses his  insight of the drama played. He probes and reveals the poetry  behind the words; he discards superfluous characteristics for the  gesture which will embody Yeats's biography of the man Judas  or the man Lazarus. He speaks his words without the intonations indicative of daily extraneous conversation and with the  passion that befits an idea of such a Lazarus and such a Christ.  He does not regard the musical interludes in the play as interpolations but realizes them as Yeats conceives them to be,  moments too weighty in thought for continued action. The  actors are frozen into a mie or tableau of character captured in  one moment of time; the audience is released from the dramatic  •  28  v 	asu06600000200030001							66501432 Bytes	3929	5640	2177095121	RGB	8	600	asu06600000200030001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/842	842	843.jp2	/asu0660/image/843.jp2

Lazarus's last impassioned or "loaded" dialogue with  Christ, more accurately his address to the audience:  Make way for Lazarus that must go search  Among the desert places where there is nothing  But howling wind and solitary birds.  is relieved by the chorus's description of the crowd's fear of  the death-stricken, death-hungry Lazarus and its reminder to  Christ that his life had its only meaning in the mutuality of  love with the Holy Women whose kisses he remembers on his  arms and whose hair he feels about his feet. This moment when  Christ remembers their presence permits the actor to mime the  recall of Christ's only moment of delight. Christ now is much  like the protagonist in Beckett's Embers who knows he exists  if he can believe himself to exist in the thoughts of another's  mind.  The concluding dance explains the ecstasy of the action in  the one moment that Yeats expects total commitment to character. All that is mind and all that is emotion is expressed. The  soldiers now reveal their personalities; they deface the cross  which is the antinomy of their earthly lust as well as the meta-  morphosized symbol of their desire. The dancers' controlled  frenzy extinguishes the spiritual idea of a Christ and establishes  his life and death as only historical fact. Uttered after the climax  of the dance, "My Father, why hast Thou forsaken Me" excites  wonder, not shame at the crucifixion. If the director must observe  the audience he can conclude that Yeats's play is a drama for the  imagination and Margaret Bradbrook's eulogy fits. The poetry  "will repel those who cannot accept the brutal and archaic laws  within their own being" and those "who expect to find in another's symbolic forms the exact reflection of their own. . . Yeats  appeals to the deep of the mind and not to the level of simple  routine; . . .28 The No and Brecht's theatre illuminate the search  for method: the practicum works.

Yeats: What Method? An Approach to the Performance of the Plays					Johnson, Josephine																											asu0660000020	actor is the stuff to "round a mighty scene." His understanding  of gesture is infinitely suitable for Yeats's characters. Clumsy,  personalized characteristics must only complicate the simplicity  of the diction. That so much can be borrowed from the No and  from Brecht does not preclude the element of naturalness which  fact Brecht reassures the unsure. The style is not purely the  school of Coquelin which creates the character for the first  performance but mechanizes the creation for all subsequent performances. Yeats is nearer to Stanislavsky than to Coquelin  but closer to the No and to Brecht in the idea of theatre and  a design for it. The Land of Hearts Desire, Cathleen ni Houlihan,  The Pot of Broth, and The Words Upon the Window Pane  most nearly fit Stanislavsky's school of naturalism, if at all, but  all of the dance plays and the plays proceeding them which anticipate Yeats's programme for the No are properties of manipulated design, even Purgatory is subject to this pattern. The  Old Man never doubts that he is being observed by an audience.  He functions at three levels; in a dreaming-back with his parents;  in a vision of reality with his son; and in the "epic" style of narration with his audience. The killing of the boy in no way  arouses empathy. Yeats designs the deed to withdraw emotion,  its suddenness incites wonder, not fear. The characters do not  wear masks and there is no chorus or a dance but the play is  a vision of life, not an imitation or representation of it, not an  illusion to delude. The actor's energy is devoted to passionate  words and ideas, not to Irish characterization. He sacrifices  "gross effects to subtle effects;" he practices "an asceticism of  the imagination."  Yeats knew that the audience as well as the actor required  training to come to terms with his plays. He realized that  "modern" acting indulged in gesture and intonation that copied  "the accidental surface of life." He knew that all imaginative  art must remain at a distance from its audience to be experienced  in the deep of the mind through style that is unmechanized,  "most human, and most delicate."  It may be necessary to broaden the concept of what is structurally right or what is psychologically sound to interpret Yeats  as he is and not as a director would make him to be.

Virgil Baker (1890-1965)					Fleisher, Roland																											asu0660000011	THE  CARRELL  Volume 6 June, 1965 Number 1  VIRGIL BARKER (1890-1965)  By Roland Fleischer  WITH THE PASSING of Virgil Barker on January  30th, the academic world was deprived of one of its  ablest scholars, whose contributions to the study of  art history won him international fame and respect. His professional career, spanning more than forty years, began in the field  of museum work, in which he served on the staffs of major museums in Washington, Pittsburgh, and Kansas City. His interest in  scholarship and art criticism led him into the area of editorship,  and he spent several years on the editorial boards of professional  periodicals. In 1931 he began his career in formal education  when he accepted a position as professor of art history at the  University of Miami, where he taught until his retirement in  1959. In addition to his teaching duties, he served as the first  director of the University's art gallery.  Although it is difficult to single out any one of Virgil Barker's  achievements in art as his most significant, it is probably through  his writings that he was able to make his most widespread contributions. His numerous articles, many of them written as an outgrowth of his editorial assignments, appeared in such periodicals  as The Arts, Art and Decoration, Creative Art, Yale Review,  North American Review, Magazine of Art, Parnassus and Art in  America.  In 1926 he published an article in The Arts on Pieter Bruegel  The Elder, the sixteenth century Netherlandish painter. This 	asu06600000110003001							63484264 Bytes	3762	5623	2247578909	RGB	8	600	asu06600000110003001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/852	852	853.jp2	/asu0660/image/853.jp2
Virgil Baker (1890-1965)					Fleisher, Roland																											asu0660000011	article, largely prepared during his assignment as European Editor of The Arts, met with such success that it was expanded and  published as a monograph the same year. It was the first comprehensive work on Bruegel to be published in the English language.  And although subsequent publications by other scholars have  increased the body of factual material concerning the painter  and his work, the brilliance of the interpretive and estimative  aspects of the monograph has shown no signs of dimming during  the nearly four decades since its appearance.  Virgil Barker's interest in the art and mind of Pieter Bruegel  always remained strong, but it was in the field of American  art history that he was to make his most extensive contributions.  In 1931 he published a monograph on Henry Lee McFee as well  as A Critical Introduction to American Painting. But undoubtedly Virgil Barker's greatest single contribution to art history  scholarship is his monumental work, American Painting: History  and Interpretation, which was published in 1950. It was the first  comprehensive one volume history of American painting to appear since the publication of Samuel Isham's The History of  American Painting forty-five years earlier. In its organization,  Dr. Barker retained Isham's first two major time divisions of  Colonial and Provincial, but, by limiting the volume to American  art produced before about 1880, omitted the third or Cosmopolitan period. This later period was left to be treated in another  book.  As the secondary title implies, the work has a dual nature. It  is American painting seen first against the background of history  and seen secondly through the author's personal insights into  the nature of the paintings and the qualities of minds which created them. It is this very dual nature of the book which gives us  an understanding of Virgil Barker's basic approach to art history  in general. He saw the art of the past, first of all, as a visual  record of man's passage through time, a permanent reminder of  how people felt and thought and of what they valued. In this  sense he regarded art as the visual memory of the human race,  analogous to the memory of the individual. The visual arts, then,  were thought of as history in visual terms. Recognizing the visual  arts as an expression of the social milieu in which they were  created, Virgil Barker discusses in his work such influences on 	asu06600000110004001							63145056 Bytes	3741	5623	2155031961	RGB	8	600	asu06600000110004001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/853	853	854.jp2	/asu0660/image/854.jp2
Virgil Baker (1890-1965)					Fleisher, Roland																											asu0660000011	American painting as Protestantism, the emergence of an upper-  class in the early eighteenth century and its disruption near the  end of the century, political independence, the cult of the  genteel in the era of Jackson, and the corruption and dynamic  growth that characterized the post-Civil War period. In this  respect, he never embraced the philosophy of those art historians  who regard the history of art as an evolution of art forms quite  independent of social, economic, political, and religious influences. Thus while some art historians feel that the development  of art forms is an expression of an inner will of those forms,  Virgil Barker always recognized the fallacy of separating the  history of art from general history.  But if Virgil Barker was mindful of the interrelationship of  art and history, he was equally aware of the limitations inherent  in using the visual arts merely as tools for the study of history.  While recognizing the fact that artists are first of all products of  their specific eras and social milieux, he took special delight in  discovering those qualities which reflect differences of mind and  vision between individuals. And he was aware that the visual  arts are probably the only means through which we are able to  preserve the physical presence of the individual's spiritual nature.  It is in this probing to uncover and understand individual expression that Virgil Barker makes his greatest contribution to  the literature of art history. His primary aim in this respect is to  discover the specific vision and quality of mind of each individual  artist. His purpose is not so much to evaluate the works of art  as it is to understand the nature of the mind and the mode of  seeing that produced the work. Virgil Barker's American Painting, therefore, was conceived not as an end in itself but rather as  a means through which the author leads the reader to fresh insights into the nature of the various works of art discussed. And  this quality of the book, even more than the author's authoritative and perceptive presentation of American art within its historical context, will assure it a permanent place of distinction in art  history scholarship.  An example of the kind of writing I refer to is to be found in  the discussion of the art of Thomas Eakins. The layman often  sees Eakins simply as a naturalistic painter who records on canvas with extraordinary skill the subjects of his paintings. While 	asu06600000110005001							64015728 Bytes	3803	5609	2609096697	RGB	8	600	asu06600000110005001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/854	854	855.jp2	/asu0660/image/855.jp2
Virgil Baker (1890-1965)					Fleisher, Roland																											asu0660000011	admiring his skill as a craftsman, the average viewer would not  regard Eakins as a painter who in any sense relied on imagination. But as Virgil Barker points out, a truly naturalistic painter  is content to rely exclusively on his vision of the subject, while  Eakins was driven to an intellectual understanding of why forms  appear as they do. And Eakins' scientific study of perspective  and anatomy was the means through which he was able to reconstruct the surface and substance of forms in his mind before he  recreated them on canvas. Virgil Barker helps us, then, to discover the nature of Eakins' imagination.  The operation of his mind did not seem imaginative to  others because it did not obviously transform appearances;  yet his way of rendering appearances relied primarily upon  acquired knowledge of what lay beneath them, and the  complete thing was re-constituted in the mind in the act of  being painted. In that process the imagination is used to  validate the researches of the intellect, and it constitutes  the renewal of nature in terms of paint.  And just as he gives us an insight into the nature of Eakins'  creativity, so he helps us see both the strengths and limitations  to be found in the provincial but ingenious mind of John Singleton Copley, America's most significant colonial painter. In the  following passage, chosen here for its lucidity as well as for the  breadth and depth of understanding it evinces, Virgil Barker  relates Copley's handling of pastels to his mental make-up.  The pastels are not uniformly successful, but the best of  them display striking brilliance and vivacity of color; and  practically all of them are marked by an overly emphatic  handling which is perhaps traceable to his positive handling  of oil. A provincial mind will sometimes push things a little  too far from a fear of being insufficiently clear; though sophistication is no cure for provincialism, and is often a  very poor substitute, one virtue in sophistication can be  tact—in handling an art medium as well as in human association.  While earlier writers usually displayed little knowledge of  American Colonial painting, Virgil Barker gives an extensive and  coherent account of the painting of that entire period. He not  only greatly increases the amount of known factual material, but 	asu06600000110006001							63640864 Bytes	3776	5616	3973316728	RGB	8	600	asu06600000110006001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/855	855	856.jp2	/asu0660/image/856.jp2
Virgil Baker (1890-1965)					Fleisher, Roland																											asu0660000011	helps dilute the general notion that painting in Colonial America  was limited to portraiture.  In the preface to his American Painting, Virgil Barker stated  that a detailed account of the painting of the Cosmopolitan era  —that is, the painting from about 1880 to the present—would  have to be treated in another volume. During the last years of  his life, he worked on such a volume, which unfortunately he  did not live to complete. However, in 1959 he published a small  book entitled From Realism to Reality in Recent American  Painting which was partially based on a series of lectures he presented at the University of Nebraska the previous year and which  gives some indication of his thoughts on twentieth century painting. The profundity of his ideas and the lucidity with which they  are expressed make all the more regrettable the fact that the  larger work remained incomplete.  A few quotations from the small volume will suffice to illustrate how thoroughly Virgil Barker was in tune with the major  forces of the present day—philosophical, scientific, esthetic.  The complete man, the complete artist, the complete scientist—all want imagination at work because the human spirit  is most completely itself when reaching for what is beyond.  The imagination in art, as in science, finds that appearances  are an incomplete account of reality. What is visible is  caused by what is invisible; and the imagination in both art  and science, wants to penetrate to that.  The relativistic viewpoint of his esthetic is apparent in the  following passage in which he points out that an art object is  valueless without viewers for whom it has value.  The total reality of art must include an audience, and the  audience must be renewed down the generations if the art  is to become part of a culture. The self-subsisting character of the universe is not repeated by art. The cosmos  will lose no inherent reality even if man, by destroying  himself, is no longer here to be aware of it. But art has no  such independent life; the material survival of St. Peter's  Cathedral or Pollock's Autumn Rhythm will have meaning, will possess full reality, only so long as men and women  stay around and value the experience it gives them. The  work of art gives out life by receiving it.  But after all and on the other hand, there is no compelling 	asu06600000110007001							63935968 Bytes	3772	5648	3278529589	RGB	8	600	asu06600000110007001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/856	856	857.jp2	/asu0660/image/857.jp2
Virgil Baker (1890-1965)					Fleisher, Roland																											asu0660000011	reason, either moral or esthetic, why every picture, or any  picture, should be permanently effective or should last forever. The ephemeral is as appropriate in art as this age  thinks it is in other possessions. In a civilization whose dynamics seem to require that things be replaced even before  they are worn out, temporariness in paintings may be an appropriate virtue. To be sure, human nature is much older  than this century; and even the most venturesome artist  may have difficulty in adjusting to the fate of being contemporaneous only. As a member of the audience I think it  quite sufficient if a contemporary picture gives me a momentary freshness; even if I can't retain it for renewed satisfaction, I have still had it once. So I shall not be either  surprised or chagrined if action painting proves to be almost as evanescent as art criticism itself.  Virgil Barker was indeed an outstanding scholar who made  numerous and lasting contributions to the field of art. And while  we mourn the passing of Virgil Barker the man, Virgil Barker  the scholar will live on through his accomplishments. But, no  real distinction can be made between the man and the scholar;  the values of the man live on in the accomplishments of the  scholar. And if you would know Virgil Barker the man, look  to the painting of those figures in art history whom he especially  admired—because they expressed, in pigment, values that were  his as well as theirs. Find in the art of Thomas Eakins that penetrating intellectual curiosity and concern for thoroughness. Find  in the art of Copley that honesty, clarity, and strength. And find  in the art of Pieter Bruegel that limitless scope of imagination  that desires to experience life in full—its humor and its pathos.  Find these qualities—and you will have glimpsed Virgil Barker. 	asu06600000110008001							63718692 Bytes	3776	5623	1665200528	RGB	8	600	asu06600000110008001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/857	857	858.jp2	/asu0660/image/858.jp2

The Impossible Possible Philosopher's Man: Wallace Stevens					Buhr, Marjorie																											asu0660000011	THE IMPOSSIBLE POSSIBLE  PHILOSOPHER'S MAN:  WALLACE STEVENS  By Marjorie Buhr  WALLACE STEVENS is not one of those tender-  minded poets who feel that philosophy will "clip  an angel's wings," nor that a philosopher is one who  "peeps and botanizes on his mother's grave." On the contrary,  he values the man who has had the time to think enough, "the  impossible possible philosopher's man," because, as he sees it,  "life consists in propositions about life." It is with these  propositions that he is chiefly concerned in his poetry.  One of the most influential propositions of Stevens' age was  the Nietzschean idea that God is dead. But unlike some of his  contemporaries, Stevens did not therefore turn away from a  world too full of weeping for us to understand nor did he see  man as a hollow reed in a spiritual wasteland. Like Nietzsche,  he saw the death of the traditional god as an occasion to affirm  life. Nietzsche disliked Christianity because it valued the herd  above the exceptional individual; because of its hostility to nature; because the passions are thought to be sinful and confidence  in oneself godless. Stevens too rejects the conventional piety, the  hypocrisy, the weak femininity of a religion suitable only for "a  high-toned old Christian woman." William James once said that  the appeal of Christianity for some people was the human god  that they could "cuddle up to." Stevens refuses a "too, too  human god, self pity's kin and uncourageous genesis." But Stevens  liked his irrationality well seasoned with irony—Nietzsche was  too much the fanatic of one idea to appeal to a man who could  find thirteen ways of looking at a blackbird.  It is balance that Stevens admires, a quality amply found in  one of his teachers—the philosopher who poises himself expertly  on the tensions arising between animal faith and scepticism,  George Santayana—who has no categorical imperatives in his  philosophy and asks no one to think in his terms if he prefers  others.  Santayana was a rebel against the Puritan elements of religion. 	asu06600000110011001							63659388 Bytes	3787	5600	2875137952	RGB	8	600	asu06600000110011001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/860	860	861.jp2	/asu0660/image/861.jp2
The Impossible Possible Philosopher's Man: Wallace Stevens					Buhr, Marjorie																											asu0660000011	Even as a child he rejected the idea that the human imagination  was an evil faculty rather than the good one his instinct  told him it was. He came to the conclusion that there are no  truths as valid as those the myth-making imagination gives us,  that the vision of philosophy is imagination and as such is sublime. For Stevens too the imagination is sublime, the one reality  in this imagined world, "the magnificent cause of being."  Santayana disliked Protestantism for trying to make the world  respectable when it is not; it is "mortal, tormented, confused  and deluded for ever; but it is shot through with beauty, with  love, with glints of courage and laughter." As Stevens puts it,  both the ugliness of the crow and the beauty of the oriole are  a part of the world—the aspic nipples of his mother earth occasionally vent honey.  The most striking parallel between Stevens' and Santayana's  thought is their faith in art as a religion in a world which doubts  supernatural absolutes. Nietzsche thought it part of the terrible  order of existence that man must invent and embody abstractions  in order to survive. Santayana and Stevens felt that it was precisely these creations which offered compensations for the lost  gods. Since infallible truth has never made itself known to man,  his truth must be symbolic rather than literal. Santayana seeks  to disprove no religion, but wishes rather to "honour the piety  and understand the poetry embodied in fables."  Stevens believes that after man had abandoned a belief in the  possibility of a positive truth "beyond all truths," poetry has to  become that essence which redeems life. "The final belief is to  believe in a fiction which you know to be a fiction, there being  nothing else." It is the spiritual task—one which Stevens felt  keenly—of the poet to create this "supreme fiction." Though  supreme, it is not eternal: one of its imperatives is that "it must  change." When mythical systems decline, says Santayana, it is  not because they are false, but because mankind begins dreaming "in a different key." Every age has its own revelation, says  Stevens, for there is an "ennui of the first idea," and an age  throws off its out-worn beliefs "as morning throws off stale moonlight and shabby sleep."  According to Santayana, the artist has a keener insight into  8 • 	asu06600000110012001							63190968 Bytes	3756	5606	292097558	RGB	8	600	asu06600000110012001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/861	861	862.jp2	/asu0660/image/862.jp2

Since substance and force  cannot be known, appearances alone are actual. The artist grasps  appearances, embodies form in matter and thus justifies whatever may underlie appearance and puts reality to some use.  Stevens' chief concern in his poetry is this relationship between  appearance and reality: "The search for reality is as momentous  as the search for God." He knew that philosophy had dismissed  the idea of substance—that the appearance that common sense  gives the world is a hoax—and that physics had endorsed this  dismissal. He quotes Berkeley in his prose and toys with esse est  percipi in his poetry:  It is as if being was to be observed  As if, among the possible purposes  Of what one sees, the purpose that comes first,  The surface, is the purpose to be seen.  Stevens struggles mightily with what he calls the anti-poetic idea  that man cannot experience reality. Can he ever transcend the  "blue infected" vision and attain that perception where what is  "real and what is imagined are one?" Is it the poet's function  to portray "things exactly as they are?" Or do men know reality  only by transcending it through the imagination?  Whatever Stevens may have learned about reality from other  philosophers, it is most likely from Bergson that he learned that  " it must change." In his "A Collect of Philosophy," he speaks  of Bergson as a poetic philosopher, and the parallels between  the two men are obvious: both were intellectuals who mistrust  intellectualism. Stevens asserts that we have grown weary of the  "sterile rationalist," the man who thinks too much: we need to  exalt the "subman" (Bergson's man of instinct) who is aware  of the spontaneities of life.  Bergson not only exalts the myth-making instinct in man  which creates the "supreme fiction," but he insists that this  faculty constantly changes. Man has never been sufficiently aware  of the radical nature of change. Mankind's error, says Bergson,  is Platonic—the attempt to abstract from a constant flux a set  of permanent, absolute entities when nothing of the kind exists.  All of Stevens' poetry asserts that knowledge must be seen "sub 	asu06600000110013001							63797316 Bytes	3788	5612	445001844	RGB	8	600	asu06600000110013001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/862	862	863.jp2	/asu0660/image/863.jp2

The immobile, the rigid, the permanent are  absurd and unreal. The only reality that man knows is a "permanence composed of impermanence."  The yearning for immutability in Spenser and Donne and Eliot  is foreign to Bergson and Stevens. The heart's desire can never  be fulfilled in a still point in a restless world. What makes "The  Auroras of Autumn" so beautiful as well as so obscure is the  constant metamorphosis of the nature of reality. No sooner does  Stevens define the source of reality than he immediately negates  his vision, and then negates his negation. Not only the created  but the creative force itself has its being in incessant change.  Although Stevens never left America as did Eliot and Pound,  he was, like them, influenced by foreign poets and philosophers.  The phenomenologists, especially Heidegger and Husserl, were  popular when Stevens was young, and his affinity with a philosophy whose prime concern is a faithful description of the given  is obvious:"the theory of description matters most." The phe-  nomenologist emphasized the significance of the imagination as  the basis for exploring experience and asked the eternal philosophic question "What am I?" in a spirit that did not so much  demand an answer as it hoped for a deeper understanding. Gabriel Marcel wants to experience the "bite of reality" just as Stevens  wants to effect a "blissful liaison" between man and his environment by attaining that state in which the real and the imagined  are one. If, like Stevens' Comedian, they both end up with the  world as the "same insoluble lump," the experience is nonetheless  "worth crossing seas to find."  The phenomenologists seek to explain man without recourse  to a transcendent power. Man must let things be what they are  —which is a great deal more difficult than it seems. Man, says  Stevens, must learn to be "in the difficulty of what it is to be."  Man should not seek to find God's purpose in the universe; rather  he must give the world value, because certain experiences are  peculiar to him and to nothing and to no-one else. As Martin  Heidegger says:  The being that exists is man. Man alone exists.  Rocks are, but they do not exist. Trees are, but  they do not exist, horses are, but they do not  10 • 	asu06600000110014001							63452660 Bytes	3781	5592	3304095931	RGB	8	600	asu06600000110014001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/863	863	864.jp2	/asu0660/image/864.jp2

Stevens also recognizes the unique nature of man in the world.  Natural objects have an inhuman nature. The leaves may cry,  but "it is not a cry of divine attention . . . nor human cry. It is  the cry of leaves that do not transcend themselves." Angels may,  by chance, exist, but, since "the greatest poverty is not to live  in a physical world," they experience nothing that we know. And  whatever gods may be do not exist as humans do. "Jove in the  clouds had his inhuman birth./No mother suckled him." God,  Stevens asserts, does not experience nor share human pain. How  then does this unique creature, man, find joy in a world not made  for him? The solution does not lie in assuming a "too-human  god," but in accepting the human condition, "the unalterable necessity/Of being this unalterable animal." Like the existentialists,  Stevens is proud of the courage that this takes: "The way through  the world/Is more difficult to find than the way beyond it."  Another factor in man's uniqueness is his knowledge of his  own death. Heidegger believes that death not only intensifies  experience but is a crucial factor in individuality, since man  faces death alone. Even though there is no immortality and death  is the ultimate experience, man, by willing his own finitude, can  alleviate the terror of death and see his life as a totality, thus  modifying the dualism caused by the necessity of perpetual self-  transcendence. Stevens too emphasizes the totality that death  gives to life. When the woman in "Sunday Morning" realizes  that "death is the mother of beauty," she is no longer forced to  be dualistic in her thinking, with one eye fixed on the birds in  the misty fields and the other on the bliss of some transcendent  world.  Man alone, says Heidegger, knows through dread the meaning  of time, being, and non-being. When Stevens speaks of the listener  in "The Snow Man," beholding the "nothing that is not there and  the nothing that is," he is contrasting modes of non-being and  implying that nothingness—a non-entity—is an entity, which is  contradictory. But Heidegger too makes a distinction between  the nothing which is merely nonexistence, "das Wesenlose," and  the that-which-is-not, "das Nicht-Seiende," which functions as  • 11 	asu06600000110015001							65262404 Bytes	3844	5656	876512138	RGB	8	600	asu06600000110015001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/864	864	865.jp2	/asu0660/image/865.jp2
The Impossible Possible Philosopher's Man: Wallace Stevens					Buhr, Marjorie																											asu0660000011	Being. When Stevens speaks of nothing's "wax-like blooms," or  tells us that it is in the "single emptiness" that we reach "the  last purity of the knowledge of good," or equates non-being and  being, "It is and it/Is not, and therefore is," he is saying, like the  phenomenologists, that the realization of nothingness gives an  insight into the nature of being that can be gained in no other  way.  Finally, Heidegger exalts the poet above the philosopher, for  it is his task to name the gods that men live by. He is the inaugural "namer of gods and the essence of things," and the universe  receives its structure from this creative force. Stevens says that  man invents the gods, thus the poet's "description is revelation."  Among English-speaking philosophers, it is apparently Alfred  North Whitehead who influenced Stevens most. The chief reality  and value for Whitehead lay in what he called "emergent pulsations of individuality." Opposing cosmological theories which  divide man in the way the woman in "Sunday Morning" is divided, Whitehead insisted that our experience of a world of  "throbbing actualities" is the most significant fact of our existence and that he who rejects this sensual world loses the root of  his being.  Man is beset by two conflicting desires, says Whitehead: the  desire that the future should bring variety, and his simultaneous  need for an immutable absolute. Whitehead solves this difficulty  by having God contain both novelty and permanence in his nature. Speaking of such apparent contradictions as "the final good  of immediate joy," Whitehead insists that the concrete and particular experience is absolute. Stevens sees the same conflict:  man does not want the ripe fruit to hang in the trees in that perfect sky forever, yet he yearns after an "imperishable bliss;" the  solution is to see that "the green fish pensive in green reeds/Is an  absolute ..." Whitehead uses the term "objective immortality"  to describe an object or event after it has "perished." It "dies"  but future ways of feeling will reclothe it with the flesh of "real  being." Stevens says that "the body dies; the body's beauty lives."  Whitehead asserts that the central problem of modern philosophy is how to relate the one and the many.

In an analysis of monism versus  pluralism, Stevens uses the piano player as symbol:  . . . Did he play  All sorts of notes? Or did he play only one  In an ecstasy of its associates,  Variations in the tones of a single sound,  The last, or sounds so single they seemed one?  Although there are almost no philosophic concepts on which  Stevens does not touch, from Plato's to Whitehead's, he satirizes  those who insist on absolute answers or who are pleased with  themselves when they succeed in making the irrational rational.  Each philosophy creates a different view of life just as each  candle sheds additional light in a room; man becomes absurd  only when he believes that the final candle has been lit or that  he has conquered reality (like the President who ordains the bee  to be immortal). The world may be just a theatre or even the  idle dream of an indifferent creator, but what difference does  it make if the mind, just once, fulfills itself? Is it not enough  to have lived a sensuous life, to have experienced the "bouquet  of being?" Both the poet and the philosopher search for reality  but the poet, says Stevens, must not adapt his experience to that  of the philosopher for the latter usually insists that reason is  supreme in that search; the poet has the imagination which brings  him the supreme fulfillment.  13 	asu06600000110017001							38603470 Bytes	3844	5723	3115309378	RGB	8	600	asu06600000110017001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/866	866	867.jp2	/asu0660/image/867.jp2

Somewhat  smaller than Lake Ontario, Lake Rudolf was not discovered  until 1888.  To the north of Lake Rudolf, within sight of its shores, rise  the great mountains of the Abyssinian Plateau. Its inhabitants,  organized and disciplined in warfare, obstructed explorations  through this most extensive of the African Montanes. To the  east, all the way to the Indian Ocean, stretches a waste of semi-  desert, trackless, largely devoid of water, food, or shelter, and  peopled by fierce Somali who defied its crossing. Approach from  the west led through the mysterious interior of the Continent.  Rudolf was discovered from the south. By 1880 Arab trading  caravans had reached Lake Baringo only 140 miles away. In  1884 the famous explorer Thomson, himself at Baringo, wrote  (R. Young, ed., 1962, Through Masailand with Joseph Thomson)  of the rich reward awaiting the adventuresome traveller who would  explore to the north. But the appalling desolation of recent volcanic activity and of aridity that stretched away from Lake  Baringo, had discouraged the most indefatigable, temptations of  ivory and slaves and rumours of a huge lake notwithstanding.  Today the explorations of Count Samuel Teleki von Szek are  virtually forgotten. His accomplishments rank high, however, and  his journey was, really, the last great expedition of discovery in  that Continent. In January 1887, more than 400 porters, some  200 Zanzibari, Ascaris, Somals, guides, two Europeans, and  livestock including 23 donkeys, began a trek that was to last  approximately twenty months. Among the loads the porters struggled under were 100 entirely of glass beads, 22 of sections of  both a canvas and an iron boat, 65 of camping gear and clothing, and one of spirits. The long, serpentine line of march pushed  inland from the mainland opposite Zanzibar.

More than a year after departure, on March 5,  1888, Teleki bestowed upon the lake before him the name of  the Crown Prince of Austria, benefactor of the Expedition.  The unknown had been breached. Enthusiasm for African exploration now at its crest, a rush of expeditions made for the  Rudolf region. Second to arrive was an American, A. Donaldson  Smith. This expedition, and his succeeding one, came, not without incident, through Somalia. The insects, fish, amphibians,  reptiles and birds he brought home formed the first representative collections from the area. Before the ashes of the campfires  of Smith's first exploration became entirely scattered, an Englishman, a professional elephant hunter, arrived at the foot of the  Lake. Arthur H. Neumann hunted the length of the east shore,  nursed himself back to health after being both trampled and  gored by an elephant, and then retraced his steps southward.  Most ill-fated of the early expeditions was that of the Italian,  Captain Vittorio Bottego. He, at last, broke through from the  mountains of Abyssinia. Bottego established that only one river,  the Omo, furnishes inlet to the Lake, and his explorations along  the unexplored west side of Rudolf made it a certainty that this  vast lake is landlocked, with no outlet1. Returning northwards,  both Bottego and his geologist were slain by the Ethiopians.  Reading the narratives of these expeditions produces an  appreciation of African exploration as well as of the African  explorer. Smith (1897, Through Unknown African Countries,  London, Edward Arnold), an M.D. by profession, was a biologist imbued with the importance of specimens, data, and exact  locations. Unlike many of his contemporaries, he apparently  sought to anticipate, not antagonize reactions of the Africans.  Neumann's account (1898, Elephant Hunting in East Equatorial Africa, London, Rowland Ward) is the diary of a com-  panionless man, a man who enjoyed lingering, uninterrupted  sojourns in lonely places. The Bottego Expedition was chronicled  by its two survivors, Lambretto Vannutelli and Carlo Citerni  (1899, Seconda Spedizione Bottego. UOmo.

There is a  tempo in these pages one does not find in the accounts by north  Europeans. Lt. Ludwig von Hohnel, Teleki's only European companion, authored reports of the expedition of discovery. Published in German, an illustrated English translation (1894, Discovery  by Count Teleki of Lakes Rudolf and Stefani, vols. 1 & 2. London, Longmans, Green, and Co.) was made. It remains one of  the most absorbing accounts of African exploration. Acutely  conscious that he was describing a new land, von Hohnel could  hardly have presented a more detailed and precise introduction  to the Rudolf area. Members of the Robert E. Maytag-University  of Miami Expedition recognized landscapes and localities, even  anticipated certain experiences from descriptions this explorer  wrote many decades ago. Credit for the lasting significance of  these accounts, however, is due not only to Germanic thoroughness, but to characteristics of the area as well. Lake Rudolf lies  within the valley of the eastern branch of the Great Rift. Gigantic  escarpments, outstanding landmarks, rim the Lake. And, the  semi-desert surrounds the Lake, even composing much of its  shorelines which are devoid of greenery. Changes proceed slowly  over such terrain.  The members of Miami's expedition to Lake Rudolf worked  for six months along the 145 mile eastern shoreline. A prime  consideration was the avifauna, some 1,400 specimens of which  were secured and are now part of the Research Collections of  the Department of Zoology. Fundamental to the appreciation of  this avifauna was an understanding of the region's ecology, as  well as thorough knowledge of what was already known about  the birds. Accounts of early exploration afforded much useful  information. Knowledge gained by the few recent workers in the  area was collected. It was necessary to obtain specific information  about the birds of East Africa, indeed about the ornithology of  the whole Continent. The late Robert E. Maytag had conceived  this investigation at Rudolf. His generosity fielded the Expedition  and supported its subsequent research. Acquisition of a reference  library in African ornithology was basic to this research.  The University Library, at the Expedition's departure, contained but a very few titles of African ornithology, the two  16 • 	asu06600000110020001							63211340 Bytes	3772	5584	51867614	RGB	8	600	asu06600000110020001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/869	869	870.jp2	/asu0660/image/870.jp2

Recourse to it was  necessary, however, if we were to appreciate the distribution and  ecology of the Rudolf birds and deal with systematics. By happy  coincidence, Le Vaillant's Historie naturelle des Oiseaux d9  Afrique, published in six volumes over the years 1799-1808,  was reproduced in Sweden in micro-edition form. Shortly after  the Expedition's return complete sets of two of the monumental  works in African ornithology appeared for sale: Anton Reich-  enow's four volumes (1900-1905), Die Vbgel Afrikas, and David  Bannerman's eight volumes (1930-1951), the Birds of Tropical  West Africa. Mr. Maytag himself undertook search for Sir Frederick Jackson's (1938) Birds of Kenya Colony and Uganda  Protectorate and eventually made available to us Lady Jackson's  own three volume set which he obtained in Nairobi. The list of  titles available for our research grew. The Library now houses  dozens of volumes of the most important references in the ornithology of Africa, rare titles such as some of the above, and most  of those recently and currently available.  The numerous journals of American ornithology are well  represented in the University Library. But the European ornithologists, who in large measure explored Africa, published in  their own journals. Particularly active in East Africa were the  Germans. The Journal fur Ornithologie issued its first volume  in 1853. Partly with Maytag support, a complete file of this, one  of the outstanding ornithological periodicals of the world, was  obtained. If a second outstanding journal of world-wide importance were to be selected, it would undoubtedly be the Ibis, the  organ of the British Ornithologists' Union. No one can work in  the science, let alone in the field of East African ornithology,  without frequent reference to it. A nearly complete set (Volume  2J. E. Chapin's four volumes of the "Birds of the Belgian Congo" deal importantly  with distribution and other aspects of African bird life. These volumes are issues  of the Bulletin of The American Museum of Natural History. Two volumes, each  a Bulletin of the United States National Museum, authored by Herbert Friedmann  (1930, 1937), summarized specimens and data gathered by Col. Edgar Mearns:  "Birds Collected by the Childs Frick Expedition to Ethiopia and Kenya Colony."  Mearns, in 1912, only 24 years after the discovery of Rudolf, rode by camel from  Aden past Rudolf and on southward into Kenya. Earlier, Mearns had accompanied  Theodore Roosevelt on his 1909 safari in Kenya.  • 17  —■ 	asu06600000110021001							39250326 Bytes	3815	5736	1109178222	RGB	8	600	asu06600000110021001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/870	870	871.jp2	/asu0660/image/871.jp2

In almost every region of the world there  are published local journals of ornithology and East Africa is  no exception. A large portion of the volumes of the Journal of  the East Africa and Uganda Natural History Society was in part  purchased and in part received as a gift from Mr. John Williams,  Curator of Birds of the Coryndon Museum, Nairobi. Mr. Williams wrote that many of the volumes he sent us had been left  at the Museum by Europeans then moving away from Kenya.  We in the Western Hemisphere may not realize that a great  horde of birds migrates south each year from Europe and Asia  into Africa. Populations of more than 180 species of these birds  winter south of the Sahara. These migrants thronged through  the Rudolf area. To treat these species adequately references  had to be made to an additional series of works. E. C. S. Baker's  (1922-1930) Fauna of British India, Vols. I-VIII, the twelve  volumes of Bannerman's (1953-1963) Birds of the British Isles,  Witherby's (1940-1941) Handbook of British Birds in five volumes, Vaurie's (1959) Birds of the Palearctic Fauna, Delacour's  (1954-1959) Waterfowl of the World—these are but a few of  the works which have been added to the shelves of the library.  The research activities resulting from the Expedition were  aided by the Library in yet another important way. In the writing  of the first volume of The Avifauna of the Lake Rudolf Area,  which is now in manuscript form, its authors, Owre and Paulson,  borrowed close to 250 separate items through interlibrary loan.  Many of these have been copied and are filed away for future  reference. Without this service, research of this volume would  have had to be removed to other institutions, entailing travel,  transportation of the specimens, time, and expense.  A library basic to research on African birds has been built  here at the University of Miami. But the Maytag support and  the incentive it engendered actually created much more than  this. When the journals and the reference works dealing with  ornithology far beyond the confines of Africa are considered, it  is evident that the nucleus of a collection necessary for research  in the general field of ornithology has been established.  18 	asu06600000110022001							63100728 Bytes	3756	5598	1071066565	RGB	8	600	asu06600000110022001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/871	871	872.jp2	/asu0660/image/872.jp2

The Challenger Reports					Idyll, C. P. (Clarence P.)																											asu0660000011	THE CHALLENGER REPORTS  By C. P. Idyll  BOOKS are the tools of the scholar. If the scholar is a  natural scientist he has other tools as well, ranging in  complexity from dissecting needles to cyclotrons. But no  matter how numerous or sophisticated his "hardware" equipment  may be he still must have books. These are the base from which  he builds his own achievement, using the discoveries and wisdom  of his predecessors. Without such background he would be forced  to start from the beginning, and science would never progress  much past the accomplishment of a single life.  At the Institute of Marine Science one of the indispensable  library tools is the "Report of the Scientific Results of the Voyage  of H.M.S. Challenger During the Years 1873-76." Here in 50  folio volumes are the results of one of the most remarkable and  fruitful scientific expeditions in history, a voyage which laid the  foundation for the science of oceanography and whose concept  of the general structure of the ocean and its inhabitants has never  been changed.  In 1859 the western world had been set in ferment by the  publication of Charles Darwin's "Origin of Species," a book  resulting from the voyage of another earth-girdling ship, the  Beagle. A lively interest in natural history was one result, and  this aided the Royal Society in persuading the British Admiralty  to provide a ship for exploration of the sea.  H.M.S. Challenger was a spar decked sailing ship of 2306  tons, with auxiliary steam power. All but two of her guns were  removed, and laboratories, special winches and scientific equipment were placed aboard. The expedition was under the direction  of Wyville Thomson, professor of Natural Philosophy at the  University of Edinburgh, an able, energetic and enthusiastic  scholar. His task was to investigate "the conditions of the Deep  Sea throughout all the Great Oceanic Basins." He and the other  men on the Challenger accomplished this in remarkable fashion.  Over a period of V/i years the Challenger travelled 68,890  nautical miles. She made scientific observations in every ocean  of the world except the Arctic, traversing an area of 140 million  • 19 	asu06600000110025001							63212648 Bytes	3766	5593	439336572	RGB	8	600	asu06600000110025001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/874	874	875.jp2	/asu0660/image/875.jp2

Her scientists made pioneering contributions to every branch of science—contributions  which were of special importance since they applied to an area  of the earth scarcely touched before. The numerous soundings  provided many times the knowledge of the depths of the ocean  that had been available previously. These soundings were made  painfully with what we would regard as primitive gear, the  weighted lines sometimes requiring over 1 Vi hours to reach bottom and even longer to be pulled back. The staff took hundreds  of sea water samples; they scooped rock and ooze from ocean  bottom that had never been disturbed in the billions of years of  the history of the earth. The biologists collected plankton, prawns,  squids, fishes and a bewilderingly rich variety of other creatures  that gave entirely new concepts of the extent and nature of the  living populations of the ocean. The science of oceanography  had been launched.  Of course all this valuable effort would have been rendered  useless if the results had not been reported. But they were, and  the volumes that constitute the Reports of the Challenger Expedition are among the most valuable of all books in the library  of any institution devoted to sea research.  The last paper in the 50 volumes is entitled "Report on  Spirula" by the Rt. Hon. Thos. H. Huxley, F.R.S., and Paul  Pelseneer, D.Sc. (Brussels). It illustrates some of the principal  characteristics of these reports: they were prepared by the most  distinguished and capable scientists available; there was a distinct international flavor to the authorship of the reports, with  no nationalism intervening; and many of the reports, like this  one, dealt with deep-sea science. Spirula is a little deep-sea squid  whose possession of an internal shell links it with a great group  of extinct cephalopods, the belemnites. It is regarded as a "living  fossil," examples of which were avidly sought but rarely encountered by the scientists of the Challenger.  The value of the Reports as historical documents is, of course,  enormous. But in addition they are surprisingly widely used as  current tools of research. The taxonomist (the scientist engaged  in the description of species and their inter-relationships) finds  them of special value. If he is working with deep-sea creatures  20 • 	asu06600000110026001							63687028 Bytes	3790	5598	2615311768	RGB	8	600	asu06600000110026001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/875	875	876.jp2	/asu0660/image/876.jp2
The Challenger Reports					Idyll, C. P. (Clarence P.)																											asu0660000011	he refers to the Reports frequently for the original descriptions  of many animals and plants. In particular there are numerous  descriptions of genera. The Challenger Reports contain the  original descriptions of 715 new genera and 4417 new species.  Of course some groups are more thoroughly covered than others.  At our Institute workers interested in fishes (especially those from  the abyss) and in cephalopods (squids and octopuses) make  frequent use of the Challenger Reports. So do biologists working  on sea fans and other soft corals, on the echinoderms (starfishes,  sea urchins), on the gastropods and pelecypods (snails and clams),  on the siphonophores and medusae (jellyfishes). They are needed  constantly by scientists interested in radiolarians, microscopic  animals producing shells that fall to the bottom and constitute  major parts of the abyssal oozes. Challenger scientists named  3508 new species of radiolarians, six times the number described  to that time. And so it is with many groups.  Other oceanographic expeditions and other ships after the  Challenger have been more elaborate, better equipped, and have  gathered more material. The American research ship Blake, under Alexander Agassiz, was one of these. In one dredge haul the  Blake dragged from 1760 fathoms more deep-sea fishes than  were caught in the whole 3Vi years of the Challenger*s operations. But neither the Blake nor the other distinguished ships  which followed H.M.S. Challenger had the same impact on science. One reason was the freshness of the information brought  back by Wyville Thomson and his associates; never has the same  excitement accompanied the collection of oceanographic data.  The second reason is that the resulting papers are of such high  quality, and that they are brought together in one magnificent  set. The collections of other ships were often less thoroughly  worked up and are all too often scattered over many journals.  These are the reasons why the Challenger reports are essential  tools of the scholars at the Institute of Marine Science. And why  Sir Ray Lankester, the distinguished British zoologist and founder  of the Marine Biological Association, stated "never did an expedition cost so little and produce such momentous results for  human knowledge."  21 	asu06600000110027001							63403224 Bytes	3753	5628	2866856479	RGB	8	600	asu06600000110027001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/876	876	877.jp2	/asu0660/image/877.jp2

Theodore Spicer-Simson, 1871-1959					Rosner, George W.																											asu0660000022	THE  CARRE LL  Volume 12 June 1971 Number 1  Theodore Spicer-Simson  1871-1959  Theodore Spicer-Simson was a sculptor-artist of great versatility. An  Englishman who lived and worked in Paris, London and the United  States, his chief interest, as an artist, was human character. For more  than fifty years, distinguished men and women of many countries sat to  him for their portraits, in marble and in bronze. He revived the ancient  and almost forgotten art of the portrait medallion, working his subtle  character interpretations in enduring metal. He was recognized internationally as one of the greatest of modern medalists.  In 1962, three years after Theodore Spicer-Simson's death, the University of Miami Press (Coral Gables, Florida) published his autobiography,  A Collector of Characters. Its final chapter is a self-portrayal and by it  Spicer-Simson becomes one of his own "Characters."  As i look back over so many years I cannot help smiling  when I consider how persistent the paradox of my  life has been. I am by no means of a challenging or  provocative nature, yet I like this paradox not as such but because it has fulfilled the deep wishes of my soul.  Here I am, dictating this to my American wife in our Florida  home amidst mango and citrus trees we planted with our own  hands. Here I am, a typical Englishman. I look English, I feel  English in my reactions, my tastes, my inclinations, my dislikes,  my habits. This is a paradox, for I come from a cosmopolitan  background. Moreover, an English national until my recently  acquired American citizenship, I am not English-born. France  was my native place. With the exception of a few years in English  schools most of my life has been spent out of England. I studied  art in France and lived and worked there for long periods. Now  the United States has become home. Traveling has taken up many  &gt;  ll&gt;   ..—T 	asu06600000220003001							67241092 Bytes	3911	5729	2493976134	RGB	8	600	asu06600000220003001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/885	885	886.jp2	/asu0660/image/886.jp2
Theodore Spicer-Simson, 1871-1959					Rosner, George W.																											asu0660000022	of my years. I never felt foreign in any country nor did I consider  myself an expatriate anywhere. Everywhere I went I lived among  a brotherhood of artists, writers, thinkers and statesmen and was  always at home in the congenial atmosphere which a common,  disinterested pursuit established around me.  Another aspect of my paradox is that nothing seemed to endow me as an artist. My father was a businessman and so were  his father and brothers. My parents' families were people of  culture and education but gave little indication of artistic leanings. Yet, when I was still a young boy I felt attracted by beauty  and became obsessed with the ardent desire to create some  myself. I dreamt of being a great artist. I remember one day  I lost my footing climbing the cliffs of Havre and saved myself  from a dangerous fall by clutching at a projecting rock. All the  time I was thinking, "If I fall I shall never be a great artist."  Whether posterity, whose judgment only counts, will consider  me "great" no one can tell for the present. But I shall always be  thankful to my father, whose understanding allowed me to follow  my avocation and to live the full and rich life of an artist.  My urge to create beauty cohabited in my inner self with a  deep and eager interest in my fellow man. But these two main  traits of my personality, instead of competing with each other,  complemented one another.  Although I first enjoyed doing statuary pieces I later concentrated on busts. As my career unfolded itself I became more and  more specialized in medallic portraiture. In this minute and almost calligraphic art I was able to translate more accurately in  plasticine, clay and bronze what I was drawing out of a man's  soul and mind. I not only looked at my models, I spoke with  them, always endeavoring to direct their words to reveal what  constituted the main interest of their lives.  Now, as I sit turning page after page of the albums where the  photographic reproductions of my work are consigned, I also  remember the human characters I collected, so to speak, in my  memory. And, conscious of having accomplished a good work  with modelling tools, I shall hope I have created with words  some pen-traced images of the many interesting persons I have  portrayed. 	asu06600000220004001							65850844 Bytes	3855	5692	1751118578	RGB	8	600	asu06600000220004001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/886	886	887.jp2	/asu0660/image/887.jp2
The Art of the Medallion					Rosner, George W.																											asu0660000022	The Art of the Medallion  Another chapter of the autobiography reveals his philosophy of the art  of the medallion and his application of certain of its principles to his  work.  It is generally thought that artists should be passionately  creating works of art and should leave the explanation to others.  The artist, however, by understanding what lies behind the forces  that swing the pendulum of taste, is less likely to fall into the  error of extremes. He neither diminishes his personality by following academic modes nor does he imitate the cubist, futurist  or other modernist styles. He may sympathize with their spirit  of revolt against hard and fast rules or forms, but he also realizes  that creating works of art involves self-control, order and harmony as well as freedom.  The great difficulty and drawback with medals and medallic  portraits is the commercial side, which insists on an indefinite  number of reproductions that can be produced quickly by machinery. Some artists, impatient of results, prefer to design on  a large scale for reduction, as it is easier and faster and requires  far less thought. The test of a good artist is that he be able to  design on the actual scale and handle well small things which  are large in style. He will not achieve this if he designs on a  large scale.  It might be of some help if I call attention to certain factors  and qualities in medallions, which may aid the reader who  desires to develop his taste or his powers of observation.  Visually, the shape of a medallion is very important, for no  form attracts the sight so strongly to itself as the circle. The eye  is held within that shape because the outline has no angle to  draw the attention away from the centre. This is all to the advantage of the subject depicted therein. However, the form that  can rotate like a wheel has no natural position or angle from  which it can be examined unless the design possesses a real feeling of gravity. This attribute should be obtained by the artist  through the lines and space-divisions of the composition to give  it counterpoise and a static quality. This stability or strength of  purpose is usually acquired by the use of two parallel lines coun-  3  •  .-it &gt; 	asu06600000220005001							67252336 Bytes	3913	5727	2342081915	RGB	8	600	asu06600000220005001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/887	887	888.jp2	/asu0660/image/888.jp2

The lines are sometimes continuous but as a rule they are sensed in the same way  as the relation of the stars to one another in what we call "The  Great Bear" or "Orion's Belt."  Life is action and change, yet if we wish to adapt any living  thing to a coin or medallion and we feel the necessity for balance,  spacing or pattern, we are forced to interpret our subject and  to consider that any modification must be in harmony with the  material of which it is made. To be a work of art a medallion  depends on this equation, as line and planned proportion are  much more important than concordance with measurements of  nature, and a living effect can be given by decentralizing the  subject depicted on a medallion.  Vision is an imperfect instrument, yet very few people seem  to realize that certain characteristics in paintings, sculpture,  coins and medallions can be explained by differences that exist  in the structure of the eye in different people. For instance,  Frank Brangwyn's paintings or Corot's landscapes, so essentially  different from each other, would appear satisfactory to shortsighted persons. These works interpret the effects of nature by  variety of tone values, without detail. They would be unlikely,  however, to satisfy or please farsighted individuals who see detail in the distance, or men with scientific training who study  small objects with a microscope. Their praise for truth of representation would go more likely to an Audubon or a Brueghel.  Consequently, what seems true to one group would seem untrue  to another group of equally educated persons. This may explain  why "Truth" is always represented naked. Each can clothe her  to suit his own taste.  In the plastic arts of the same category and of different nations,  dissimilarities exist that are racial and can be traced to the physical conformation of the eye. The diversity of treatment existing  between landscapes painted by Europeans and the Chinese can  be explained by the fact that the educated Oriental has been  shortsighted for centuries; detail of their pictures in the foreground is definite, in the background vague. Almost all their  painters came from the intellectual class, who were litterateurs  and poets as well. The pictorial and complicated signs of their  • 4 	asu06600000220006001							66932468 Bytes	3880	5748	3225399618	RGB	8	600	asu06600000220006001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/888	888	889.jp2	/asu0660/image/889.jp2
The Art of the Medallion					Rosner, George W.																											asu0660000022	written language must have helped to increase this myopia, for  all preferment in the old days was acquired by memorizing their  literature.  The Greeks apprehended that sight was imperfect. As we all  know, the columns of their marvellous temples were given a  convex form so as to appear straight to the eye. The details are  simplified in Hellenic sculpture. Their finest coins are in high  relief, so we may conclude from that that the greater number of  the inhabitants were farsighted. Basrelief would make the striking of the coins easier and would be perfectly satisfactory to a  shortsighted race.  All great works of art are well composed and possess a general  effect, however much the details are carried out. This explains  why the works of geniuses, men such as Van Eyck or Brueghel,  are so superior to paintings of an extraordinary technician like  Meissonier. This quality or character combined with originality  in design and fine draughtsmanship is typical of many of the  Greek coins of the Fifth Century B.C. and certain medallions  of the Renaissance.  All living things possess a distinct personality. Even inanimate  objects have essential characteristics that are rarely discerned  immediately by the eye, such as density, elasticity, hardness and  softness. If by use of such innate qualities the artist may express  better the idea he wishes to convey, then he must interpret them  in such a way that we may recognize them although they are  depicted in a different material. This succeeds in giving character  to his work. Let us take a concrete example—a piece of cloth,  for instance—to discover its essential nature. Its external aspect  may be rough or smooth, but at a distance can we know whether  we are examining linen, silk or sacking? How do we distinguish  substance without direct contact? Colour or the surface texture  may not help us at all for they are common to all objects, but  the drapery falls characteristically and, whatever the material,  it will be revealed by the shape of the folds. The subject may  be depicted at any scale without loss of intelligibility. Scale is  used here to mean proportions that make subjects clear, adjusting them to the necessities of the space and design without attempting to show their actual relative sizes. In this way a deeper 	asu06600000220007001							66669720 Bytes	3873	5736	1182743111	RGB	8	600	asu06600000220007001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/889	889	890.jp2	/asu0660/image/890.jp2
The Art of the Medallion					Rosner, George W.																											asu0660000022	truth of representation is attained than by slavishly attempting  to put down all we see without modification. Nature turns a  blank face to those who hold a mirror up to her, even if the  object is a human face.  A portrait, I once said, is the shade of one being transmuted  through the soul of another, the artist. This can be proved, for  a portrait is always judged by emotional relationship of the onlooker to the person portrayed. Today the psychologists teach  us that man is affected by mass-arrangement and colour; therefore, the spiritual character of persons can be represented before  a single feature takes a definite form. This is perhaps the slight  contribution I have made to the art of medallic portraiture. This  is where mechanical instruments fail, although machines are  being used in the reproduction of functional works of art successfully and will gradually supplant the artisan entirely. The reducing machine now takes the place of the die-cutter, whose art  is practically lost, and sculptors who have not studied what  would be relevant as subjects or the scale and design suitable  for these diminutive circular reliefs, feel themselves competent  to carry out orders for coins and medals, since the machine is  capable of accurately reducing the largest reliefs almost to vanishing-point.  Cutting the matrix directly by hand in steel or bronze obliged  the artisan to interpret all forms in a simplified manner because  of its small size. Therefore he was less likely to fall into errors  of scale or excessive detail. It discouraged him from attempting  to seize anything but the principal or characteristic forms. The  work will also bear the mark of the tool. All struck coins before  the year 1839 and cast medals up to today convey a sense of  their method of growth and the material in which they consist.  These are qualities to be found in all great works of the plastic  arts.  . . . Technique or handling is a vital means of disclosing the  character and emotions of the creator of the work. This explains  why most of us do not respond emotionally to machine-made  "art" objects, although we may greatly admire manufactured  articles that are functionally perfect, for they have beauty of  fine and proportion. Hence it follows logically that the greater  • 6 	asu06600000220008001							66895328 Bytes	3897	5720	3416546361	RGB	8	600	asu06600000220008001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/890	890	891.jp2	/asu0660/image/891.jp2
The Art of the Medallion					Rosner, George W.																											asu0660000022	the number of processes interposed between the artist and his  finished work, the less expressive will be the result as a human  document. Consequently, the hand-cut die for a coin or medal  in wax, or one cut in relief of the same size as the finished work  will give the finest artistic results.  In an address read before The American Numismatic Society at its  meeting of March 1, 1917 Spicer-Simson clearly defines some self-imposed rules he followed all his artistic career:  Portrait reliefs or medals must conform more nearly to the  individual peculiarities of the person portrayed than pictorial  subjects, compositions or designs representing something less  personal. Balance must be obtained without too much formality  of pattern or disharmony results between the realism of the face  and the position it occupies in the space allotted to it. The great  artist adapts the sitter's characteristics and transmutes them by  his intellectual perception of form into somethinjfpossibly more  direct and tangible than what is exactly before his eyes, yet in  harmony with the psychology of the person portrayed. It requires great discrimination to feel just to what degree formality,  another term for order and design, should be carried and realism  sacrificed so that the subject will still possess that changeable  emotional quality we call Life. It is interesting to note that the  spiritual character of the individual, which in portraits is surely  of more importance than the exterior shell, may be suggested  before a single feature of the face is shown. For instance, by the  relief projection. A vigorous relief would hardly be suitable for  a poet, unless he were a Walt Whitman; or a low delicate relief  for a General Grant; mass gives an impression of strength and  aggressiveness, whereas, slight relief, where the background and  subject melt together, imparts a sensation of subtlety and tranquility indicating subjective, reflective and tender qualities. The  space the head fills in the circle, the position it occupies near  or away from the outline, with or without shoulders, may be  used to emphasize the character of the sitter, both physically  and mentally. The style of the lettering, its size and position, will  also influence the onlooker's judgment as to the psychology of  the person portrayed, as well as making or ruining the relief  as a Work of Art. With all these points to be taken into consideration by the good portrait medallist he must yet not lose 	asu06600000220009001							66394656 Bytes	3880	5702	2443248825	RGB	8	600	asu06600000220009001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/891	891	892.jp2	/asu0660/image/892.jp2
The Art of the Medallion					Rosner, George W.																											asu0660000022	the primary reason for the existence of the relief, which is decorative: a quality generally gauged when interest is displayed  in the medal by others than friends of the sitter! This should  be the ideal of all artists.  In the Biographical Dictionary of Medallists and Engravers (London:  Spink & Son, 1902-1930) there is a statement so early in Spicer-Simson*s  career and yet so accurately testifying to his skill as to be almost prophetic. This appraisal was deserved then, amply fulfilled later and can  still stand today as a summary of his life's work.  Mr. Spicer-Simson is always vigorous without being insensitive  to the charms of detailed definition. He has a remarkable faculty for catching the right moment and the right pose which,  coupled with a reserve in treatment and an absence of anything  pertaining to mannerisms, makes his portraits still more interesting on closer observation. He is and will become more and  more a leader among medallists in Great Britain and America.  He possesses in an exceptionally right proportion the qualities  by which the independent artist is distinguished. His work  bears the stamp of a dominating personality. The various sides  of his art have been developed together; his skill of craftsmanship is guided by his aesthetic sentiment, based on the study  of the art of the great masters of history. He is true to himself,  and holds among our modern masters a place which but few  artists can claim to share. 	asu06600000220010001							66460288 Bytes	3886	5699	1807077537	RGB	8	600	asu06600000220010001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/892	892	893.jp2	/asu0660/image/893.jp2

"The Persistent Paradoxes of My Life"					Rosner, George W.																											asu0660000022	"The Persistent Paradoxes  of My Life"  The opening lines of Theodore Spicer-Simson's autobiography have a Dickensian ring. "How often have I  thought about the extraordinary part my paternal  grandfather had in influencing my life, even though he had been  dead years before I was born. He had nine sons and the eldest  found home life impossible so he ran away . . . When my grandfather lost most of his fortune through the dishonesty of his  partner, my father, feeling his responsibility as next eldest, resigned from the mercantile service and became a stock broker."  Theodore's parents, both British subjects, were married in  Havre. They planned a brief honeymoon in France but were  prevented from leaving by the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian  War. They remained for the duration of the conflict and Theodore, their first son, was born in Le Havre on June 25, 1871.  Theodore's early years included a five year sojourn in Tasmania  (where his father ran a sheep farm) and schools in England;  Germany and France. When he was seventeen, his father, recognizing the potentials of the artist in the boy, sent him to art  school in Paris. Faced with three years of compulsory military  service which he dreaded as a deterrent to his art studies, Theodore says ". . . when I was eighteen, according to French law  at that time, I was free to claim the nationality of my parents  or that of my place of birth. I chose to remain English."  By the time he was twenty four he had met and to some  degree profited by contacts with significant personalities of the  time which included the sculptor Jose de Charmoy, the French  author Marcel Schwob, the artist Jean-Paul Laurens, and Jules-  Clement Chaplain "then supposed to be the greatest medalist  in France." He describes himself as being in 1895 a happy young  English artist, sculptor and medalist, poor but not in need.  In his lifetime Theodore Spicer-Simson made many trips to  the United States, but none was more memorable than his first.  In 1895 he met in Paris, and immediately fell in love with, an  13  •  mti    * 	asu06600000220015001							67260092 Bytes	3889	5763	1787556163	RGB	8	600	asu06600000220015001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/897	897	898.jp2	/asu0660/image/898.jp2

The following year, traveling steerage, he went to Washington, D.C. to ask for Margaret's  hand of her brother. Margaret and Theodore were married in  Alexandria, Virginia on July 1, 1896. From that day until his  death 63 years later the couple shared a mutual understanding,  devotion and loyalty. Margaret (known affectionately as Margie or Gretchen) was an accomplished artist specializing in  iiiiniatures. She had studied in Paris under Boutet de Monvel.  She forthwith abandoned her career and dedicated herself completely and wholeheartedly to Theodore. Her charm, her quietly  pervasive manner, her gentle and kindly womanliness helped  greatly in later years to win the friendship of many prominent  personalities who were Theodore's medallic subjects.  Referring to the years just prior to 1905 Theodore explains  that *\ . . I had decided to specialize in medallic portraits for I  saw their great possibilities and advantages. The reason why I  chose this little comprehended and unappreciated (except by  specialists) form of art was that it gave me freedom to control  my medium from the beginning to the end, from the plasticine  to the actual portrait in the copper or bronze and, if necessary,  I could cast the model myself. At the same time, since my materials took up little space, I could carry everything in my pocket.  In addition, it allowed me to travel and make the acquaintance  of interesting people all over the world instead of their having  to come to me."  Having decided he would be happiest in this medium Theodore  applied himself with sole and absolute dedication to the thing  that counted most in his life, his art. He believed in a Destiny  that had chosen him as the privileged instrument.  By nature a kindly and gentle man he made deep and lasting  friendships with relatively few of the many people he knew. He  was a tall, slender man of distinguished appearance. For the  most part those who could not penetrate beyond his habitual  reserve and dignity considered him aloof, distant, egoistic.  For his medallic subjects he favored and sought out writers,  scientists, political leaders, businessmen. As a "career-artist" he  had to depend upon commissions to support himself and his  beloved Margaret. They lived frugally, but never in dire want.  •  14 	asu06600000220016001							66512808 Bytes	3859	5743	379952806	RGB	8	600	asu06600000220016001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/898	898	899.jp2	/asu0660/image/899.jp2

These were the years of his great literary  subjects. In 1924 was published in a limited edition of 530 copies  Men of Letters of the British Isles; portrait medallions from  the life by Theodore Spicer-Simson with critical essays by Stuart  P. Sherman . . . (N.Y., William Edwin Rudge.) Sherman's  essays, incisive and penetrating, deserve wider distribution and  recognition. Twenty-nine writers are portrayed: Arnold Bennett,  J. D. Beresford, Laurence Binyon, Robert Bridges, C. K. Chesterton, Padraic Colum, Joseph Conrad, William H. Davies,  Walter de la Mare, Charles M. Doughty, John Drinkwater, Lord  Dunsany, St. John Ervine, John Galsworthy, Thomas Hardy,  Ralph Hodgson, AVE. Housman, W.'H. Hudson, Douglas Hyde,  James Joyce, John Masefield, George Meredith, Sir Henry New-  bolt, George Russell (AE), George Bernard Shaw, James Stephens, Hugh Walpole, H. G. Wells, W. B. Yeats.  In the mid-20s Theodore and Margaret began to look toward  their retirement needs. Upon the urging of their close friends  the plant explorer David Fairchild and his wife Marian, they  bought property close to the Fairchild home in Coconut Grove  (Miami) Florida and had a house built. It was not until more  than 20 years later that they were able to take up permanent  residence there. By then the 75-year-old Theodore had, among  other vicissitudes, suffered the indignity of confinement in a  concentration camp in France during World War II. His health  was shattered. The once sure and skillful hands quavered. But  he was determined to produce one more portrait, deferred for  over 30 years. How agonizing the long demanding hours of work  must have been! From what hidden source did the strength  come? In 1950 Theodore Spicer-Simson made his final portrait  medallion, a tribute to his friend Robert Frost.  Theodore Spicer-Simson was first known as artist-sculptor to  collectors and connoisseurs in Europe. There his work had long  been part of the permanent collections of many principal museums. In 1923 a significant exhibition of his medallic portraits  was held at the Massachusetts Historical Society in Boston. On  that occasion Mr. Edward T.

"The Persistent Paradoxes of My Life"					Rosner, George W.																											asu0660000022	The variety shown is remarkable, and the means employed to express the individuality of his subjects as varied  as they are imaginative.  To his own inborn ability Mr. Spicer-Simson adds that  inestimable quality so often lacking in present day artists  —an understanding and appreciation, as thorough as it is  sympathetic, of the great masters of the past. It is rare to  see reflected in the work of one man so many of the characteristic qualities of the Greek, of Roman and of Italian  masterpieces, the graceful lines, the subtle modeling, the  sure instinct for balance and spacing of the Greek, the truthfulness and ability in portraiture of the Roman and of his  pupil and descendant the Quatrocento Italian. To all, Mr.  Spicer-Simson adds his own originality of thought, a  sensitiveness of touch, a something that is perhaps as much  the poet's as the artist's.  20 	asu06600000220022001							67082264 Bytes	3908	5720	3412654697	RGB	8	600	asu06600000220022001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/904	904	905.jp2	/asu0660/image/905.jp2

From these same sources there are sometimes indications of  ownership of these portraits in museums, societies, and private collections.

The Total Act					Dickey, James																											asu0660000040	THE  CARRELL  Volume 28 1990  The Total Act  An Introduction to The Seamless Web, by Stanley Burnshaw1  James Dickey  In our time - and encompassing all past time, and, I am willing to bet,  future time as well - this book is the most eloquent and persuasive argument that exists for poetry as the one total act possible to us: the only  process given to the human being in which he functions not only as an  animal in a particular form, with certain specialized features, but as an  entity in which all concomitants are one: a complex dynamism marshalling every resource available, and in its strivings toward memorable utterance also avid for those beyond availability, hinted but never given.  The Seamless Web tells us that the poet speaks not merely as a human  mind but as a creature; one whose humanity is only part of his endowment of being.  Burnshaw begins with an assessment of two ways of thinking: "those  that seem to be involuntary and those that seem to be brought into play  by the will." The "seem" is important, for what Burnshaw asserts is the  essential and in some ways ungovernable interplay between these two  types which in actuality are not capable of definite separation: voluntary  thinking is always to some extent involuntary, and the reverse. By means  of a kind of scientific mysticism based on a great many technical sources  - themselves fascinating - but moving also in a speculative realm beyond  the enormous array of empirical evidence, Burnshaw puts himself solidly  into position to ask the most important of all questions concerning the  creative process: who is doing the creating? This, and its corollary: what  is meant when one says "I"?  In this book one skips nothing; "seamless" it is, indeed. The reasoning is so complex, and involves such a wealth of attested detail, that one  can never risk dropping one of the threads, though it is often difficult to 	asu06600000400003001							65741572 Bytes	3852	5687	77028887	RGB	8	600	asu06600000400003001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/922	922	923.jp2	/asu0660/image/923.jp2
The Total Act					Dickey, James																											asu0660000040	hold them all. The reader realizes early, however, that the journey toward Burnshaw's final evaluations is at least as important, for its information, its passing insights and the imaginative possibilities these  suggest, as the conclusions they make possible. Then, too, the "way in"  is so deceptively simple that one is likely to assume that the subsequent  observations will be so, as well. They are not, but by the time the reader  has passed the first primitive hurdle, the discussion of the terrors of basic  animal self-preservation the author calls "the great Paleolithic fear, with  its attendant internal preparations for struggle," he is fully into an encounter he realizes is not only likely to enhance and deepen his existence,  but to change it.  For me, the most fecundating of Burnshaw's researches are those dealing with the effects on the human body of the various environments in  which it exists: the earth's magnetic field, the linkage of the body to the  movement of the earth and the moon, the tides of the ocean to the circulation of the blood and to blood pressure, the "Circadian rhythms" relating to pulse rate, urine volume, and body temperature, the electric  changes in brain waves effected by those in the electromagnetic field of  the planet, and - beyond, and always incoming night and day - cosmic  rays, and by implication influences from unknown and infinite sources  capable only of tentative measurement, and suggesting others that are  not.  To my knowledge, never has instinct as it comes to an end in words  been so convincingly tied to the whole of creation, and by such an inventive multiplicity of threads that one is drawn toward what amounts to a  new kind of veneration for life, consciousness and their maintaining circumstances, and thus, in turn, to a form of contemplation that is in an  entirely new sense religious.  Mallarme, who might be looked on as the presiding spirit of The  Seamless Web, tells us that "My thought thinks itself." Again, the Eskimo Orpingalik told an ethnologist that "We get a new song when the  words we want shoot up out of themselves." Hyperintellectual or  "primitive," Burnshaw's sources round to a common conclusion: we are  beyond ourselves when we write: blood and the stars have got together  on us. Or, "creativity is the work not of a six-inch cortical area of the  human brain but of the total human organism": with Donne, "The Body  makes the Minde."  Nevertheless, in keeping with his pervasive emphasis on totality as  well as his own experience as a poet, Burnshaw does not leave out of account the role of conscious artistry. There has never been a more sure-  handed manual of revision than this, a more useful assessment of the inventive power of rational focus: of "reason on fire." 	asu06600000400004001							65852828 Bytes	3845	5707	3240506474	RGB	8	600	asu06600000400004001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/923	923	924.jp2	/asu0660/image/924.jp2
The Total Act					Dickey, James																											asu0660000040	On "native language and the conditioning of thought" Burnshaw also  has much to say, and when one enters into this portion of his thought it  is with a strong and positive shock of recognition that the reader recalls  the author's theory of translation in his extraordinary The Poem Itself,  which has given an extra dimension to the transliteration of poetry, and  virtually created a new genre. He is especially at home in the limbo between languages that the translator finds himself in, and the temptations,  prohibitions, and possibilities that surround him there, when the choice  of a word, say, depends not only on equivalence, and not on predictable  connotation, either, but must be determined by or has a chance to draw  upon the translator's own imaginative powers, and what vision he may  summon: on resources not available to the original poet. As a personal  note, it seems to me that this inventive limbo, in which, some of the  time, and for some translators, it is better not to know the first language  perfectly, is largely responsible for the "international style" that seems  predominant in English-speaking poetry at this time. And it should also  be apparent that the exploration - and not just the superficial exploitation  - of this vast territory may well promise the most exciting discoveries  since the Elizabethans. If the blank-verse line can be said to have helped  Shakespeare become himself, we can also say - and already - with equal  justice that "free" translation - the "imitation," the "version-from,"  the "suggested-by," and the "adapted-from," or even the "re-write" -  have had a comparable influence on our own age and our own imagination. It would be excessive to say that Stanley Burnshaw's example alone  has brought this about, but it has been and is a very powerful factor, and  whatever emerges from this approach in the future will certainly bear his  hand-print.  Having finished The Seamless Web the reader feels that he is not  finished, and will never be. In the end the reader, especially if he is a  poet or aspires to be, thinks not about the book but about himself and his  resources, about what the universe has given him to funnel into his  words: the words waiting in his own biorhythms, the Circadian cycles, the  tides and the sun and moon, in cosmic rays and forces beyond all these,  unascertainable but always incoming. One goes back through the book  compulsively, then re-assimilating everything, including the Notes and  Comments: all Notes and Comments. Circadian cycle? Mystical, in essence. Instinct? Also. Birds? Perhaps the greatest mystics, with their celestial navigation, their homing capacities. Fish? Bees? All mystics. We?  As well, in infinite complication and fascination. But also, by means of  our language, with an opportunity to use all these things in a way that  is ours alone. 	asu06600000400005001							66278636 Bytes	3869	5708	377971078	RGB	8	600	asu06600000400005001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/924	924	925.jp2	/asu0660/image/925.jp2
The Total Act					Dickey, James																											asu0660000040	In the end it is beautiful and simple: as simple as flight for the sparrow, as swimming for the trout. You think of God's advice to the millipede, the thousand-legs who asked the Universe that made him how to  work all those legs. Does this one go here? If it does, what do I do, then,  with this one? With all these others? God's advice is Burnshaw's: Don't  think, just walk."  Swing from the heels; get the earth into it; your feet will tell you how.  Also the tides. And the stars. Burnshaw's reliance on instinct and spontaneity, on "fusions of resemblance," releases metaphors at a rate the  mortal poet would hitherto have thought impossible, before he became  aware of all that feeds into them: of everything he has going for him. The  central emphasis on the whole body and the environment it draws on as  engendering the association, the mental picture, is something the poet acknowledges gladly, and moves with: in the present case - and under  exactly this influence - has come the image of a javelin thrower just after  the release. The body is off the ground, having just delivered everything  with everything; the spear is in the air where it will go.

Bathsheba					Smith, Tom, 1933-																											asu0660000040	Two poems by Tom Smith  Bathsheba  David arose from off his bed  and walked upon the roof;  and saw a woman washing herself.  -11 Samuel 11:2  Listen: treetops are washing  the night air. He leaves his bed.  The treetops whisper: woman.  Through the sleep of girls he walks.  Breezes call him to the roof.  Cool is the drift of the roof  beneath slow stars and the washing  clouds above him as he walks  the night air. Bright from his bed  the dream comes with him: woman.  Night, an elusive woman,  while each roof slopes after roof,  makes the restless plain her bed.  The moonlight dews, the washing  stars unflesh him where he walks.  He thinks he's a ghost who walks  among wolves. Then the woman  shapes out of shadow washing  her nape, a shining. The roof  drifts from his feet, sailing bed.  Great oars lift beside the bed  and the sailing planet walks  its orbit. Now from the roof  King David watches woman  wring demons from her washing. 	asu06600000400008001							65933384 Bytes	3853	5702	3834731843	RGB	8	600	asu06600000400008001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/927	927	928.jp2	/asu0660/image/928.jp2
Letter to my Mother					Smith, Tom, 1933-																											asu0660000040	Letter to my Mother  When first I wintered, in your womb,  you were not rinded like an orange.  Afterwards the room that I was peeled into  was not a blazing orchard.  You had asked for brilliant oranges,  but oranges were dear,  the nation's whole economy was black, and you  were pregnant facing in the Five and Dime the girls  and customers until on Christmas Eve you quit  and joined your handsome husband out of work,  his catatonic mother,  and his father drunk.  The dark comes early from December until March,  but could not hide the darkness in the house.  You were afraid.  You couldn't keep a boarder anymore  who never paid his rent.  Then I was bodily evicted.  Darkness stayed.  When I was small 1 had a yellow cat.  The cat was fat and sleepy.  I'd sit and hold him on my lap  whole afternoons.  The wooden step beneath me glowed.  The fat slow sun sat in the sky.  The cat slept in my lap  and did not try to get away.  The summer I was ten 1 could not sleep.  Every night, while something selfish hid  beneath my bed, I tossed weeping.  Then you came from the lighted kitchen.  You can't be blamed  that, when you said there's nothing to be afraid of,  you were not convincing. Something darkness made  came nervous with you to my side. I slept no better,  but you left the door ajar to let the kitchen in.  A shadow lurks behind the sun each dawn.  You carried the Great Depression in your body.  I was born. The house was mad.  You were afraid. The world was bad.  Could you prevent a madhouse from your narrow bed?  Sometimes a yellow cat suffices and we've sunny days.  Sometimes my heart and hunger know how darkness stays. 	asu06600000400009001							66739940 Bytes	3896	5708	3818427887	RGB	8	600	asu06600000400009001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/928	928	929.jp2	/asu0660/image/929.jp2
Sweeney Aloft					Logan, Henry																											asu0660000040	Henry Logan  Sweeney Aloft  I am the weightiest, fat globe among  those hung here, and my hooked toes  have learned to hold on through forty winks  to any branch, forked branch myself, where owls' eyes incinerate sleep  and jays' cries crack my waking.  Crazy as bird fright, thrice have I dropped  bowel's weight enough to strip manhood from  any man's bum. But bone still thrusts  its plucked fancy up, too big for a bird's  and, by its beard's tongue, still too much man  for them, in their stiff collars and black coats.  By fits and starts I try flight, fall back  branch cracking, oranges thump earth, all  in vain, Sweeney Bird Brain is still too much, if  not quite enough, man less half. But, sons  mine, sing praises, for, who was eagle once  is turkey now, insecure aloft, and will not  pounce on two nice mousies or their mother  much, at least by day. At night, beware.  My brain, then, knows it's insane. A fright  so fierce lights these owl eyes, that oranges burn  and Crazy Sweeney calls on Christ, despite his  rage, or even on black backed, bell clanking  Ronan, whom never then, nor do I now much like.  Such cowardly cravings come, the flight  of whose free spear sang, until it struck  that book stuffed magpie, and his friend spilled out  Qodspout of curses, and brave Sweeney ran  out of the battle:  Sweeney's insane! 	asu06600000400010001							66813928 Bytes	3870	5753	2304709906	RGB	8	600	asu06600000400010001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/929	929	930.jp2	/asu0660/image/930.jp2
Sweeney Aloft					Logan, Henry																											asu0660000040	who had the broadest shoulders in a dream.  Who am I then? Do oranges speak Erse?  Do planes and cars surround our backyard island?  Invasion of ghosts! Sons, to your mother, speak  of my breaking brain, that she, or some dear  sister sent, will pluck my sweetness home.  Owl eyed or not, my madness swells  the orange bells of these forked branches,  buzzard aloft, drum sticks and orange juice,  naked as a jay bird! And if death brought  me flat back, a woman twigged me up again.  Hair of the dog, boys, Sweeney's insane!  Sometimes a cat comes, and cats remind  in their rubbing way, sleek fur and claws.  Clown Sweeney dances, cap and bells, meek  madman, while the mood lasts. O my boys,  bring innocence and I'll slide to her lap,  and, failing that, in whore's lap I'll hide.  And there's the place for failed, old, horny unicorn  unhorned, Sweeney aloft, erected here  as stiff in fear as any star forked lover  left, dreaming of father, mother, son and daughter  dead. O mother of mine (of you, my sons)  send aproned lap and I'll drop, sane, to love.  Once there, I'll pray, yes, even that,  a come down, in fact, for this warhorse  once fierce, whose horn pierced heart's gore.  Our Father, Hail Mary, by rote. But if Ronan,  the black, finds out, he'll roust Christ  from bed to cast me from such earthly comfort!  Note: Sweeney, a poetic anti-hero of Irish legend, purportedly went mad at  the Battle of Moira (A.D. 637) and was transformed, in fulfillment of St.  Ronan's curse, into a bird of the air. Loquacious, horny, cunning, and self-  pitying - in short, quintessential^ Irish - his lyrical boastings and laments  comprise an epic poem of great beauty. Sweeney is not a given figure of  myth or legend but a literary creation, perhaps but not certainly based on a  historical character. Allusions to the tale place it as early as the ninth century,  but the Buile Suibhne, upon which Flann O'Brien drew in At Swim-Two-Birds  and, most recently Seamus Heaney in Sweeney Astray, is thought to have  been composed at any time between 1200 and 1500. 	asu06600000400011001							66290584 Bytes	3884	5687	3826036670	RGB	8	600	asu06600000400011001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/930	930	931.jp2	/asu0660/image/931.jp2
Night's Rippled Pool					Lorenz, Johnny																											asu0660000040	Johnny Lorenz  Night's Rippled Pool  The yellow squares that constitute a drowsy town  mimic the evening stars, remnants of a day passed,  shimmering coins fallen from sun's golden pockets  abandoned to spin in their own precious metal.  In the darkness that slipped into a child's bedroom  through the window, the only open eyes are those  lidless ones attached to some six-legged creature  lying pressed beneath an elbow, inanimate,  in awe of its own absurdity. The child rolls  images across the backside of his eyelids,  like a movie screen drawn outside the cubicle  of consciousness and wherein pictures shoot by like  free verse or hot swirling gusts outside the chilly  stillness of walls. The boy fidgeting in his sleep  rearranges the landscape of blankets and limbs.  Smiling, he reveals a row of sugarcubed teeth  like small rabbits huddled in the darkness, leaving  only a stuffed bedmate to guess at what mischief  plays within the soft head of a child surely to  reinvent itself when the purple of night pales  in morning, and the slender fingertips of sun  come down to unlace the eyelashes of sleepers.  Then sleep-nourished children might run outside to cling  to the necks of trees and laugh at the brown lizards  who bathe in the sun. And unless we are thought of  as being tangential to sanity or just  sloppy drunkards, we refuse to join them, or we  watch from a distance, like clergy chaperoning  a high school dance, quietly wanting permission  to abandon the dull perimeter that we  might shove our numbers of years into our pockets  and then make the reality of our days as  intriguing as the absurdity of our dreams.  10 	asu06600000400012001							66403620 Bytes	3863	5728	2924964280	RGB	8	600	asu06600000400012001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/931	931	932.jp2	/asu0660/image/932.jp2

Stanley Burnshaw and the Body					Zaller, Robert																											asu0660000040	Stanley Burnshaw and the Body  Robert Zaller  Stanley Burnshaw is now in his ninth decade. The continuing vitality  of both his work and his legacy is evident in the spate of new and reissued publications that have marked the past ten years. Burnshaw was seventy-five when his fictional epic, The Refusers, appeared, the last segment of which, "My Friend, My Father," was subsequently issued as an  independent volume by Oxford University Press. At eighty he published  Robert Frost Himself, a work part memoir, part biography, part criticism, and part eulogy - the encounter of two major American poets of  the century, one world-famous, the other yet in mid-career. The past year  has seen the republication of some of Burnshaw's most significant works,  including The Seamless Web, The Poem Itself, and The Modern Hebrew  Poem Itself, the former a meditation of striking originality and erudition  on the creative process, the latter two anthologies of foreign verse illustrating Burnshaw's method of assembling line-by-line translation, alternate renderings, and textual commentary to present the fullest possible  experience of poetry in other tongues. At the same time, A Stanley  Burnshaw Reader has appeared, offering a judicious sampling of his  work over more than five decades.1 New work, too, lies in the offing: a  Collected Poems that winnows and updates his previous retrospective  volume, In the Terrified Radiance (1972); and a literary memoir.  Longevity and versatility alone would make Burnshaw's career one of  the most interesting in twentieth-century letters. But his work also  exhibits a remarkable inner unity and cohesiveness, qualities made manifest in the Reader. For readers approaching Burnshaw for the first time  this is the book to have, while those already acquainted with him will  recognize in it the distillation of his abiding themes.  Chief among those themes is the human ascent. Little more than three  hundred years ago the West still lived in a world in which an English parliament could seriously debate whether the decalogue should not be substituted for statute law in anticipation of the millennium. The great Cromwell notoriously relied on Providence, awaited its guidance in all he did,  and exulted in its immediate presence on the field of his victories. Fifty  years later such attitudes were no longer intellectually respectable and  today they are no longer even comprehensible to most people. The ruling  metaphor of the modern West has been evolution, not Providence, and  there is today not a single corner of our culture it has not penetrated,  however unwelcome it remains in some quarters. We have learned to  25 	asu06600000400027001							65299280 Bytes	3820	5696	3436090764	RGB	8	600	asu06600000400027001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/946	946	947.jp2	/asu0660/image/947.jp2
Stanley Burnshaw and the Body					Zaller, Robert																											asu0660000040	look backward and downward for the source of our identity, not forward  and upward. The consequences of evolutionary thought are abundantly  manifest in modern poetry as elsewhere, but since Tennyson they have  been mostly deplored, and both modernist and postmodernist verse have  been characterized by attitudes of cultural nostalgia and political reaction.  Of all post-Romantic poets - and critics - only Burnshaw has taken the  idea of our creaturely evolution seriously as a basis for reimagining man  in the modern world. The first element of this project was to situate the  human firmly in the natural, a task undertaken in the early and justly celebrated lyric, "Bread":  This that I give you now,  This bread that your mouth receives,  Never knows that its essence  Slept in the hanging leaves  Of a waving wheatfield thriving  With the sun's light, soil, and the rain  A season ago, before knives  And wheels took life from the grain  That leaf might be flour - and the flour  Bread for the breathers' need . . .  Nor cared that some night one breather  Might watch how each remnant seed  Invades the blood, to become  Your tissue of flesh, and molests  Your body's secrets, swift-changing  To arms and the mounds of your breasts,  To thigh, hand, hair, to voices,  Your heart and your woman's mind . . .  For whatever the bread, do not grieve now  That soon a flash of the wind  May hurry away what remains  Of this quiet valiance of grass:  It entered your body, it fed you  So that you too can pass  From valiance to quiet, from thriving  To silenced flesh, and to ground:  26 	asu06600000400028001							66482684 Bytes	3912	5663	3705595399	RGB	8	600	asu06600000400028001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/947	947	948.jp2	/asu0660/image/948.jp2
Stanley Burnshaw and the Body					Zaller, Robert																											asu0660000040	Such is our meager cycle  That turns but a single round  For the deathless flesh of the earth,  For the signless husks of men dead  For the folded oceans and mountains,  For birds, and fields, and for bread.  The human is naturalized through the simple, sacramental act of eating  bread, by which it partakes of nature's "essence"; the natural is  humanized by its conversion into flesh, and domesticated by the ritual act  of one lover feeding another. But what is human - the beauty of breast,  thigh, hand, hair, voice - is in turn but an aspect of passage by which  mortal existence embodies and returns to "the deathless flesh of the  earth." Bread, itself an act of process - Burnshaw's description of it as  a product is deliberate - is the agent of the ultimate cycle by which all  life is renewed, and therefore linked. If the sentiment is as suitably classical as the Bible's "all flesh is grass" or Hamlet's graveyard soliloquy,  the response is a thoroughly modern one. The cycle is an end in itself;  there is no transcendence, only transformation. Burnshaw's emphasis on  process throughout the poem - not the gentle declensions of Arcadian  convention but violent, invasive process - is the key to his aesthetic. Before evolution was propounded as the ruling metaphor of biological development, Newton's laws had redefined the world as a contract of motion rather than a covenant of grace. In Burnshaw, grace would be the  residue of beauty - the lover's suspended glance, the mound of a breast  raised by "the breather's need" - within the ceaseless, deathward impulsions of process.  The Newtonian world - within which "Bread" is still situated - is one  in which process is purely circular, and time is experienced as pathos.  The poem's argument would not have been alien to Donne or Marvell,  although the passage of three centuries has made its expression more  hard-edged. Blake's expostulation against Newton had, however, its  point: by reducing the world to circularity, Newton had robbed it of epic,  as the poetic void between Milton and Blake evidenced. The future  seemed to belong to ever more stoical expressions of pathos, to Shelleyan  revivals of myth, or to reactionary nostalgia of the sort typified by Eliot.  Evolution, of the Nature-red-in-tooth-and-claw variety that so horrified  Tennyson, seemed at first to offer only a new gloss on the old Newtonian  testament. Literary naturalism embraced it for awhile, but, too slavish to  the text, soon dwindled into sociology. Yet evolution represented a new  possibility for epic, an idea grasped by Marx and Treitschke alike,  27 	asu06600000400029001							65008628 Bytes	3836	5647	524007864	RGB	8	600	asu06600000400029001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/948	948	949.jp2	/asu0660/image/949.jp2
Stanley Burnshaw and the Body					Zaller, Robert																											asu0660000040	though coarsened in the hands of both. Still essentially nostalgic, the  Romantic historians looked toward evolution for precisely what it could  not offer, final closure. Evolution, as only long pondering would reveal,  was epic writ forward from a premised origin, not backward from a predestined end. But origin, precisely, is what has most deeply embarrassed  Western culture, and it was perhaps not until Freud had made us consider  it the most intimate sense that evolution became genuinely available as  a literary resource.  Alas, the moment was brief. Unmediated nature was too raw to behold, and humanity risen from the slime too repugnant to contemplate.  The symbolists - and their modernist and postmodernist successors -  were quick to assert a sovereignty of language over nature, as their political contemporaries were to assert a sovereignty of empire. Only a narrow  though tenacious file - Frost, Jeffers, Rexroth, Roethke, Dickey, the  early Ted Hughes, the early Seamus Heaney - has marched clear of establishment poetics, and kept faith with the earth.  To this number - this band of Antaeus - Burnshaw belongs. He has  registered his admiration for Frost, as Dickey has expressed admiration  for him.2 To Burnshaw alone, however, belongs the distinction of having  grappled most strenuously, and most rewardingly, with evolution as both  cultural metaphor and scientific fact.  Evolution as fact: the first fact is the body, which in drawing itself  erect drew apart from its animal forbears, separated from them by its new  capacity for seeing up, and in seeing up distinguishing what had been  seen as down. The birth of the human is the achievement of altitude, perspective, the prospect of what had never been "there" for any species  before. The experience that invited - the trauma that has never left us -  is the void:  Man with brow in the air,  Man with the spine erect,  Forepaws hung at the sides,  Drop your head to the grass:  What can you hear down there?  Nothing, nothing.  Listen,  Man with head in the air:  Raise it higher and higher  To the plain of alarming birds:  What can you hear up here?  Nothing, nothing.  28 	asu06600000400030001							66699344 Bytes	3897	5703	1588763255	RGB	8	600	asu06600000400030001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/949	949	950.jp2	/asu0660/image/950.jp2
Stanley Burnshaw and the Body					Zaller, Robert																											asu0660000040	These lines, from "The Valley Between," are part of a remarkable  series of poems in which Burnshaw strives to evoke ancestral man in all  the terror, frailty, and freshness of his new being. To recover this ancestor - the ancestral self that lives in us all - is to comprehend our identity  and to perceive our situation at the deepest imaginative level. It is very  hard work, most often frustrated, though the frustration itself - the pathos  of unbridgeable distance - can make for exalted art:  Would we could know  The way men moved  When thought was only  A great dark love  and blood lay calm  in a depthless dream.  ("Blood")  Now I cannot regain  Even by wilful dreaming the father faces  Or the eye or hair of the ancient women who bore me  Or think to imagine how they might pull me now  Into the redness of their singing river.  ("Their Singing River")  Asserting failure, Burnshaw achieves success, for these dim figures are  present to the reader; Burnshaw has evoked them not by abrogating the  distance that separates them from us but by acknowledging it. In their essence they are that which is ungraspably present in us; they are out of  reach in the same way that the suddenly opened landscape was for the  first erect hominids, our retrospective gaze falling short of them as theirs,  swiveling fearfully at the newly revealed world, struggled to establish  order in it.  Burnshaw sees the human task as continuous with that of our early ancestors. In "A Coil of Glass," our exploration of the heavens is an extension of their first attempts to comprehend landscape, a quest which by  the circular path of relativity brings us back to them: "All the dead years  sleep/ On the faces of quiet stars." Imagining the telescope as compact  from the "pure hard tears" of our longing for origins, he sweeps it back  along the human past, finding in myth as we find in science the image  of "The fact we hope to see."  29 	asu06600000400031001							66087960 Bytes	3852	5717	507481033	RGB	8	600	asu06600000400031001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/950	950	951.jp2	/asu0660/image/951.jp2
Stanley Burnshaw and the Body					Zaller, Robert																											asu0660000040	But Burnshaw's sense of the human spirit remains tied to the fact of  our physical being, both as its biological basis and as the somatic link  that binds the generations and anchors us to the earth. His favorite  metaphor for that connection is blood: "the mind woven of blood," "the  dim fraternities of blood-and-mind." It is this enspirited blood that he  conjures when he writes of being drawn back by ancestors "Into the redness of their singing river,'' an image whose rich tonality is enhanced by  its cognates in such poems as "A Coil of Glass," "Bread," "Caged in  an Animal's Mind," and "Anchorage in Time."  Blood not only incarnates the possibilities of thought and feeling, but  of action; and the first, defining act of our humanity, as Burnshaw tells  it in "The Axe of Eden," is the shedding of it. In his revision of  Genesis, his Adam - who is Burnshaw himself, confronting his own  mirror-image - sins not from desire for knowledge but in terror of the  God-inhabited landscape:  He is everywhere. Fly!  Save yourself! What are eyes against arms? Fly!  Hide in the cave by the wall, and think, think  A waking dream to save. Seize! Kill  If you must - all is alive in this land but the stones.  Take one! harder, fiercer. Raise it and strike! But stop -  Everything bleeds.  The terse, jagged phrases - typical of the later Burnshaw - suggest the  confusion and alarm of the unnamed Adam, whose sense of exposure is  both the helplessness of the infant and the nakedness of the adult. The  divine fertility of Burnshaw's Eden - "all is alive in this land but the  stones" - is menacing, a potency that threatens to overwhelm nascent  human consciousness. Instinctively the hand reaches for what it can  shape, discovering in the same instant the first tool and the first weapon:  "The edge that kills creates." The stone becomes an axe, and  Burnshaw's phrase suggests its double function. But killing in itself  creates, because by depleting creation it compels replenishment. It is  man's first response to God, an act of defiance that is also a plea for recognition. Stunned by his audacity, he seeks justification from the very  deity whose wrath he has incurred: "Go to God with your stain!/ Ask  who made you shed the blood."  In Burnshaw's Eden, man is the author of death; he receives it not as  a punishment but as a birthright. He is also his own victim, his own sacrifice on the altar, for since all men are one each murder is self-murder,  and the axe of Eden - the mark of divided consciousness - is forever  buried in his own skull:  30 	asu06600000400032001							66499876 Bytes	3904	5676	485014586	RGB	8	600	asu06600000400032001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/951	951	952.jp2	/asu0660/image/952.jp2
Stanley Burnshaw and the Body					Zaller, Robert																											asu0660000040	Everthing made  Is good and sacred. The paradise dream  of childhood never was. You were old  The instant you crossed the wall out of Eden,  Forehead gouged by compelling will to follow the sudden self  Boiling your veins.  "The Axe of Eden" attempts to follow primitive thought to the root  of godhood, the great conception formed in the "terrified radiance" of  our minds. This has led Burnshaw back to his own Jewish origins, both  in the long poem "Mirages" (1976), excerpts from which are included  in the Reader, and in the tripartite novel The Refusers, selections from  which also appear. This interest has been a sharpening rather than a narrowing of focus, for the tribe is, for each of us, the direct link to ancestry, humanity writ small.  In The Refusers, Burnshaw takes three paradigmatic figures - the lawgiver Moses; the seventeenth-century heretic Uriel da Costa; and his own  father, Ludwig. Each represents a phase of Jewish experience: tribal formation; ghettoization; and the search for modern identity. There is an implicit autobiographical component in these portraits as well, as the last  one suggests most explicitly. In a lesser author this would seem presumption, but it is fully consistent with the project we have seen in the verse,  the quest for origin as a means of defining the self through common identity and shared nature. This neither presupposes a strong personal ego nor  the reverse; if Burnshaw's Moses and Uriel exhibit vaunting pride, the  portrait of his father, who chose the compassionate career of running an  orphanage, is of a man selfless in the best sense.  Readers have found the portrait of Burnshaw's father the most sympathetic part of his dense and difficult novel, but for me the most arresting pages (Reader, 176-190) are those which describe Moses' invention  of God atop Sinai. Monotheism is the greatest idea produced by the  Western mind; if it originated in any specific imagination it was that of  the Jewish people; if it was fixed and formulated at any moment it was  on Sinai. There could be no more challenging literary task than to make  this moment psychologically credible, and I doubt that anyone can do it  better than Burnshaw. What his Moses discovers is emptiness; what he  fills it with is God. Yet even as he prepares to perpetrate the hoax of revelation - a hoax that will enable him to mold his tribe, and much of future civilization - he is unable to quite disbelieve in the Yahweh he is  fashioning; the limit of skepticism is the quest for further belief. We cannot, in the last analysis, imagine ourselves without God, cannot hold off  the sky that threatens to crush that first Adam in "The Axe of Eden."  31 	asu06600000400033001							65078424 Bytes	3832	5659	904275358	RGB	8	600	asu06600000400033001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/952	952	953.jp2	/asu0660/image/953.jp2
Stanley Burnshaw and the Body					Zaller, Robert																											asu0660000040	The sin of Uriel da Costa in The Refusers is in discovering this essential truth, a sin he pays for, like the Spinoza he anticipates, by excommunication. It is a truth still scandalous, as witness the reaction of Denis  Donoghue, whose Introduction to the Reader does it the honor of contending with it:  As a Christian, I am bound to find this passage [from "A Coil of  Glass," where Burnshaw juxtaposes "Adam, Arthur, Christ"]  shocking .... The Christian myth is not something dreamed up  by a few hungering minds: the Gospels bear witness to a life; they  do not, like Burnshaw's Moses, invent one. (xviii)  Without raising the question of Mr. Donoghue's Christianity, his objection seems to miss a point: if Moses' Yahweh is a fiction then Jesus'  sonship is based on one too, unless one repudiates the Judaism of Jesus  entirely. For Burnshaw, however, the matter is clear: God is the organizing principle of our culture, the road that leads from the chaos of Eden,  though whether to God himself we dare not affirm:  Emptiness seeps through the air, it is seeping  Into our clothes ....  To learn, we were told,  Is to wait and ask - nothing was said of a presence.  ("Emptiness ....")  Moses' moment on Sinai is crucial for the development of religion, but  no less so for art. Moses exalts man as homo faber - "Men can create  you, Yahweh! People are makers!" - but it is the acknowledgement of  spirit that makes artists from among the hewers of wood and drawers of  water. Thus Burnshaw's third major enterprise has been aesthetics. As a  working critic, he has been active since the 1920s and 1930s, and in The  Poem Itself he elevated the stepchild art of translation to the highest  levels of practical criticism. His major treatise however has been The  Seamless Web, whose full title - The Seamless Web: Language-Thinking,  Creature-Knowledge, Art-Experience - suggests its plan of attack as well  as its daunting scope. It is a work that, most simply put, attempts to  define poetry as both the archetypal form of human culture and its ultimate  product.  Poetry, as Burnshaw notes, is at once the most primitive and the most  refined of human utterances. It is, literally, a somatic event, with the  same basis in interactive response to the environment as every other bodily event. In turn, the poem as artifact causes kinetic response in others.  32 	asu06600000400034001							65761900 Bytes	3870	5662	2752050613	RGB	8	600	asu06600000400034001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/953	953	954.jp2	/asu0660/image/954.jp2
Stanley Burnshaw and the Body					Zaller, Robert																											asu0660000040	As Burnshaw finely puts it:  Like anyone else, a creative artist inhales the surrounding world  and exhales it. Whatever is taken in is given back in altered condition or transformed into matter, action, feeling, thought. And in the  case of creative persons, an additional exhalation: in the form of  words or sounds or shapes capable of acting upon others with the  force of an object alive in their surrounding worlds.  The poem, a series of markings on paper, is not only an object of consciousness, as a bill of lading might be, but an object in consciousness,  a thing that enters us substantially, and becomes tissue with the tissue of  our minds. "The body makes the mind," Burnshaw quotes Donne; and  the poem, as a graft of mind upon mind, is also a graft of body upon  body, something that physically alters us. As Burnshaw reminds us, a  poem is a powerful psycho-physical event, the discharge of a complex  excitation in the form of a verbal artifact adequate to its expression. It  engages the totality of our capacity and experience, first in the poet himself and then in the reader. It is both inexhaustible and unpredictable,  since it encompasses the whole of the existing world while simultaneously creating one that is new.  Each poem builds on all others, enlarging a shared tradition. Each  poem also builds the world, actualizing the latent meanings of language,  and setting free the word: "[A]ll words in all poems," Burnshaw says,  "reach out in all directions, influencing everything around them, both  near and distant." In this sense all our experience is intertextual. Language, the evolved mode of human consciousness, is, for better or  worse, the instrument by which we touch the world. It is the very body  of our consciousness, the "texture" of our experience; and therein lies  the danger that we will mistake the symbolic world it creates for the crea-  turely world we finally inhabit. This is the temptation of a reified or dogmatized language, the fatal seductiveness that bids us rest forever in the  cave of the text. It is poetry that frees us from this prison-house of language by freeing words into the totality (and contingency) of their meanings, the unframed and all-possible world. If - as one might object -  poetry is still language commenting on language, it is language that has  been forced through the body, and thereby connected with, in  Burnshaw's terms, "the medium of actuality," "the body of the world."  It is thus through poetry that we can recover, if only momently, the  unity of all existence that Burnshaw calls the seamless web. This unity  is one not of identity but of participation, undifferentiated only in the  sense that it precedes consciousness. Burnshaw is, in a strenuous sense,  a monist, though a wholly nontheistic one. The distinction we make  33 	asu06600000400035001							65748304 Bytes	3838	5708	3031100466	RGB	8	600	asu06600000400035001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/954	954	955.jp2	/asu0660/image/955.jp2
Stanley Burnshaw and the Body					Zaller, Robert																											asu0660000040	between matter and spirit, he believes, is a perhaps inevitable category  of our thinking; the division between matter and spirit that dualism infers  in nature itself is quite another matter. The former answers to our divided  consciousness, to our organic evolution and species consciousness as creatures who inhabit a symbolic world. The latter would equate the world  we were created in (and in which we still participate) with the one we  have created for ourselves, and so would make us the authors of ourselves, collapsed gods.  The progression of human consciousness in Burnshaw is thus from instinctual being to theistic differentiation (God as the world-principle separate from ourselves) to the reification of consciousness through language  - the Western project from, say, Vico to Rorty. This is a project to which  poetry stands in principle opposed, although like any other mode of consciousness it is hardly unaffected by it. It is opposed because the task of  poetry is to embrace the otherness which we are, to make us feel our root  in the world. There are political as well as ontological implications in  this, a point well illustrated in Burnshaw's celebrated quarrel with Wallace Stevens. Burnshaw, reviewing Stevens' Ideas of Order (1935) in  New Masses, speculated about his apparent confusion of social and intellectual purpose. Stevens replied with a poem, "Mr. Burnshaw and the  Statue," thus precipitating a controversy that long outlived the poet himself. Burnshaw's review (reprinted in the Reader together with commentary and later reflections) singles out three lines that are particularly  emblematic of Stevens' aesthetic:  The magnificent cause of being,  The imagination, the one reality  In this imagined world  The imperial sovereignty of the Romantic imagination is elevated here to  the creative principle of "being" itself, defined as its product; imagination is God, and the world is the play of its fantasy. Burnshaw's evolving  response to this sentiment - including his 1961 and 1989 essays on Stevens - provides an epitome of his own conviction that man, if he is to  grasp his own reality, must understand it as sharing "a common ground  of elemental being" with "the whole of [the] creation" in which he is  situated.3 This same phrase occurs in his lecture, "A Future for Poetry:  Planetary Maturity," which extends the argument of The Seamless Web  and calls for a "creature poetry" that is responsive to our kinship with  other species and to our responsibility for the biosphere.  Burnshaw's invocation of a "ground of being" points to a religious dimension in his thought which no attentive reader can fail to perceive.  34 	asu06600000400036001							66089696 Bytes	3877	5680	2099985250	RGB	8	600	asu06600000400036001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/955	955	956.jp2	/asu0660/image/956.jp2
Stanley Burnshaw and the Body					Zaller, Robert																											asu0660000040	L  This is perfectly compatible with the nontheistic monism that characterizes it generally. What men have hitherto called "God" has been, as  Burnshaw emphasizes in The Refusers, a projection of human need. Limited to the representation and satisfaction of that need, it remains an inadequate and (ultimately) retrograde conception, for the anthropomorphic  God only leads, as it has in our time, back to anthropocentric man. Yet  the need itself is rooted in actuality - like any other need, it is tied to  our creaturely existence and thereby to the world - and so cannot be dismissed as simply "imaginary." Burnshaw's Moses does not stop addressing God even after he has avowed his disbelief in him, and the silence  into which he speaks is not merely his own solitude. What lies beyond  it will be ours to explore when we have turned from our present absorption in ourselves and have rediscovered - if need be, reinvented - our  solidarity with the earth. This enterprise, which Burnshaw calls planetary  maturity, is, in his view, the necessary next step in man's evolution. If  such a statement seems optimistic it is neither wishful nor idle, for man's  mastery of the planet, as Burnshaw contends, was implicit in the axe of  Eden, that flint of consciousness around which the human hand shaped  its first instrument, and which leads him toward whatever final illumination is his:  Now it stumbles, dwarf in the maze  That the thinking hand had spun.

VENNING  Editor's Note: Dr. Swingle was Consultant in Tropical Botany at the University of  Miami from October J 941 until his death in January 1952. His botanical library of  3,500 volumes was given to the University by his wife, Maude Kellerman Swingle,  "in appreciation of how pleasant the last 10 years of his life had been made because  of his association with the University.'' In addition, his diaries, notebooks, letters,  honors, and significant papers were presented to the Library's Special Collections.  IN DECEMBER 1940, as he neared the mandatory retirement age of 70,  Dr. Walter T. Swingle was one of America's outstanding botanists and  agriculturists. Instead of taking pride in the accomplishments of a fifty-  year career with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, he felt frustrated.  He did not think of himself as old, had no intention of retiring and could  not possibly think of leaving the Department, for he had work to finish,  projects to continue, new work to begin.  As a world authority on citrus, he was writing a 412-page monograph on  The Botany of Citrus and Its Wild Relatives of the Orange Subfamily, the  culmination of many years of technical study. As an international expert on  the date palm and the founder of date culture in America, he felt his judgment and guidance were still needed for this industry to obtain optimum  success. A career-long student of plant pathology, he was worried that the  "tristeza" disease he had seen the year before destroying Brazilian orange  groves might enter the United States now that air travel had begun. If it  were to, no one else was taking seriously the threat that California growers  stood to lose all their orange trees, Florida growers half of theirs. As a geneticist and plant breeder (he had coined the term "plant breeding" back in  1897), several hundred of his citrus hybrids were yet unstudied, undescribed,  untested as new rootstocks.

Swingle planned a series of monographic studies like the one he  was writing on citrus, now that a technique had been perfected under his  direction for "restoring" dried plant specimens from the herbaria and preparing them for microscopic study. As a student of Chinese civilization he  had found eastern Asia to be a veritable storehouse of useful plants, and  although he had supervised extensive translations from Chinese literature  about them, he knew the surface had barely been scratched, and who was  better able to continue the work? In addition, there were all those plants  used by primitive peoples to stupefy fish. They needed to be correctly identified and studied as possible sources of new insecticides. There was no end to  work in sight.  At the time that formalities were under way that would allow him to  remain as a collaborator at the Department of Agriculture Swingle was  stricken with his first serious illness, appendicitis. In hospital after surgery he  was visited by David Fairchild, his friend from student days at Kansas State  University. Fairchild invited him to his home in Coconut Grove, Florida  and Swingle accepted. As early as 1897 the two friends had envisioned a  future retirement in south Florida, and now perhaps that time had come.  When Fairchild returned to Miami in 1940, he took sub rosa action  prior to Swingle's arrival, in the hope of making it possible for Swingle to  keep a promise made years before in the enthusiasm of youth.  In 1896, after Henry M. Flagler had completed the Florida East Coast  Railroad as far south as Miami, he became interested in the creation of a  laboratory to study tropical plant diseases. As an inducement, in 1897 he  offered the Department of Agriculture an acre of land in Lemon City, about  fives miles north of the mouth of the Miami River. When Mrs. Mary  Brickell heard about it, she promptly offered six acres of Brickell Hammock,  if the government would put the laboratory there. Both Swingle and Fair-  child had hoped that such a laboratory could include a garden for introducing and studying tropical plants.  Swingle and his assistant, Herbert John Webber, were ordered to Miami  in the fall of 1897 to inspect the sites, take possession, and get things started.  They found the hammock land ideal, and persuaded Flagler to subscribe  $1,000 towards construction of a laboratory in lieu of the acre in Lemon  City. Swingle and Webber hired a crew and personally surveyed and staked  off six acres between the old road to Coconut Grove and Biscayne Bay,  supervised partial clearing of one acre, and had construction of the laboratory under way when they were joined by Fairchild early in 1898. None  of them had been in south Florida before; they were thrilled by its tropical  character, by the young seedling mango, avocado, and papaya trees in  people's yards, and by having a place where they could grow tropical plants.  It was the first official U.S. Plant Introduction Garden. They made plans  to take turns in managing it, and, in their enthusiasm, solemnly promised  each other that when they retired, they would all move to Miami, where  they could work together studying tropical plants. 	asu06600000300004001							66257356 Bytes	3887	5680	2368976812	RGB	8	600	asu06600000300004001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/964	964	965.jp2	/asu0660/image/965.jp2

(Frank Denmire), 1920-																											asu0660000030	These plans had not worked out; their individual abilities had led to  positions of far greater scope and responsibility than the management of  a six-acre garden. At retirement, only Fairchild had moved to Miami, where  he devoted himself to tropical plants. Webber had become a pioneer  cotton breeder, later Professor of Subtropical Horticulture and Director of  the Citrus Experiment Station of the University of California at Riverside.  Although now professor emeritus, he was still at work, and all his family  ties were in California. Swingle had passed up retirement at 65, and at the  age of 70 was staying on in Washington as a collaborator; his wife Maude,  only 53, was a bibliographer at the department library. They needed her  salary now that living costs were rising. Their oldest boy was still in college,  the younger one just entering, the older daughter about to be married, and  the younger one starting high school. What possible chance was there of  his moving to Miami? Fairchild could see none; yet, might there not be a  way?  Fairchild called on Dr. Bowman F. Ashe, president of the University  of Miami and a member of the board of the Fairchild Tropical Garden. He  outlined Swingle's career, and wondered if the University might offer him a  part-time or similar position. Dr. Ashe was noncommittal, but expressed an  interest in meeting Swingle.  By February 1941, Swingle was well enough to travel. He arrived in  Miami just before the annual meeting of the Fairchild Tropical Garden.  Colonel and Mrs. Robert H. Montgomery gave a luncheon for the officers  and members of the Board of Directors, at which both Ashe and Swingle  were present. After lunch, Ashe approached Swingle and said, "I'd like to  have your opinion. What do you think the University's role might be, in  relation to the needs of Latin America?" (Before jet travel, Miami's proximity to Latin America was perhaps of greater significance, and President  Ashe stressed the need for fostering studies in the Hispanic-American field  as "the true means by which sympathetic inter-American understanding  could be advanced." A limited student exchange program was under way,  but in looking toward the future, would these efforts be enough?).  Swingle replied with a profusion of ideas, for he was never at a loss  for ideas. He felt deeply and warmly toward all people; he understood the  meaning of intellectual good will, and, when talking to someone, he had  that rare gift of making you feel that you and your concerns were the only  things in the world that mattered at the moment, and he meant it. Dr.  Ashe was favorably impressed and located a "Friend of the University"  who agreed to provide an honorarium for three years. He then invited  Swingle to call on him.  "We would like to propose," Dr. Ashe began, "that you act for us as  Consultant in Tropical Botany, to help make your information and experience available to the University, to South Florida, to the Latin American  countries, and to science in general. We can't offer more than an honorarium and a travel allowance, but we can give you an office, stenographic  help and student assistance, and the laboratory equipment you need for  your work." Dr. Ashe continued, "You'd be a member of the faculty and 	asu06600000300005001							66298396 Bytes	3894	5673	1960663597	RGB	8	600	asu06600000300005001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/965	965	966.jp2	/asu0660/image/966.jp2

We have no desire to limit you as a free agent." It was hard to refuse such  a proposal. Swingle talked it over with his family when he returned to  Washington and then accepted. Dr. Ashe was pleased, Dr. Fairchild elated.  I was a senior at the University at the time, a botany major and student  assistant. We noticed the famous "cardboard" partitions being shifted to  make a new room about 12 by 20 feet. When the hammering and sawing  continued, we looked in to see that bookshelves were going up all the  way to the 15-foot ceiling. Then came the big wooden boxes, 11 from  Washington, 12 from California: three tons of books. Finally, Dr. Swingle  arrived, a tall, slim, distinguished-looking gentleman with white curly hair,  a trim white moustache, and manners suggesting Old World courtliness.  He spoke in a soft voice accompanied by expressive hand-gestures. I was  assigned to help him unpack his books.  Each box contained an assortment of books, journals, technical bulletins, and the like, so we had a big sorting and collating job on our hands.  As we worked, Dr. Swingle kept up a running commentary about each  item. What I had assumed would be routine mechanical labor turned into  a whole new botanical education. (Our botany courses had given us a  respectable understanding of the fundamentals of the plant sciences, and  a lot of experience studying living plants, but we had not learned much  about botanists themselves, nor had we had much exposure to original  botanical literature. In those years, the library had an "excessively modest"  number of titles in botany, and subscribed to one or two botanical periodicals. I had never heard of the publications we were unpacking.)  Among the books there were some "birds of rare plumage". A thick  quarto, bound in vellum, was a Greek edition of Pliny the Elder's Historia  Naturalis, published in Athens in 1559. "It's worthless as science", Swingle  said, "because Pliny only went to second-hand sources, and it's part fact  and part myth. The one time he undertook an original study he got into  trouble. He went to investigate the eruption of Vesuvius, the time it buried  Pompeii, got caught m a cloud of poison gas, and was asphyxiated." When  The Gardener*s Calendar, London, 1754, turned up, he observed, "They  call England a nation of shopkeepers, but they're also a nation of gardeners.  I don't know any other people in Europe as dedicated to growing plants  for pleasure." He showed me the hand-painted gold designs on the page  dedicating The Voyages and Travels of the Ambassadors to Tartar, Persia,  and Muscovy to His Majesty, King Charles II, printed in London in 1669.  The beautiful full-color lithographs of grape varieties in a half-folio monograph, La Grandeur de Tunisie, d'Algerie et du Maroc, reminded him that,  "We've never been able to grow Old World grapes, the viniferas, in the  eastern part of this country; it's either too cold or too wet, and they go  down under a host of pests and diseases. But west of the Rockies it's  another story. In 1898 the Office of Pomology paid my way to Europe to  make a collection of good table grapes that might work out in California.  I stopped in Paris to look them up, ran across this monograph, and decided  to collect in North Africa, too. Some of those were the most successful." 	asu06600000300006001							66443956 Bytes	3900	5677	2121790391	RGB	8	600	asu06600000300006001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/966	966	967.jp2	/asu0660/image/967.jp2
Walter Tennyson Swingle, 1871-1952					Venning, Frank D. (Frank Denmire), 1920-																											asu0660000030	When we came to the Chinese books, it was clear that he held them  in special esteem. It was the first time I had seen an authentic Chinese  book; the binding went all the way round on four sides, like a box with  the ends missing, and was held shut by two ivory pins on little straps,  the pins inserted into keepers. "See how the Chinese make a book", he  said, as he slipped out the pins and opened it. To my surprise, the cover  fell away loose, and inside was what looked like a stack of large paperbacks. He handed me one of these, explaining, "They bind each chapter  separately; that way, you don't have to hold the whole book while you  read it."  When Chi Han's Nan fang tsfao mu chuang9 was unpacked, Swingle  told me, "This is the oldest Chinese botanical treatise we know of. Chi  Han wrote it in the 3rd Century. In it he describes a method of biological  control of the insect pests of oranges and other fruit trees, in use in south  China. The Chinese colonized their trees with a voracious stinging ant  that drove all other insects away. These ants nested near the branch tips  by sewing leaves together, and they all went into the nest at night.  Chi Han reported that these ants were raised, "harvested" by tying a sack  over the nest at night, then cutting off the twig. They were then sold to  the farmers, who tied the nest in a tree, opened the bag, and stretched  bamboo poles from tree to tree so the ants would colonize the whole  orchard. When we translated and published it, nobody paid the slightest  attention. They didn't believe it, but you know what? We found a village  in south China where they still raised and sold these ants to the farmers,  just as Chi Han described 1700 years ago!"  We did not always spend my eight work-hours a week unpacking books;  there were local people and places Swingle wanted to visit, and he took me  along with him. On these occasions I was treated as a colleague and  expected to act as the "devil's advocate" — to offer opposing data, or take  a different side in the question he had brought up. It was his method  for arriving at a sound conclusion, and for stretching the mind, but it  could be hard going. He had been so long familiar with the technical  details of his specialties, he did not realize how dismayed his "colleague"  was by being expected to discuss such opinions as, "I think the Proeime-  quat throws light on bigeneric Fortunella-Citrus back-crosses, possibly  represented by the Malay hedge lime, since the Procimequat is really  intermediate between a true bigeneric back-cross and a trigeneric hybrid,  because Fortunella hindsii is in the subgenus Protocitrus."  By the semester's end the last box had been unpacked; the books,  journals, bulletins, and reprints all sorted and on the shelves. Swingle was  going back to Washington, I was graduating, the country was at war, the  future uncertain. I told him goodbye, not really expecting to see him again.  It worked out differently, however.  Swingle was completing his monograph on the Citrus subfamily. The  Department of Agriculture had provided technical facilities and an assistant, Dr. Albert H. Tillson, for the work. Many of the type specimens of  5 	asu06600000300007001							67573296 Bytes	3918	5747	664998184	RGB	8	600	asu06600000300007001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/967	967	968.jp2	/asu0660/image/968.jp2
Walter Tennyson Swingle, 1871-1952					Venning, Frank D. (Frank Denmire), 1920-																											asu0660000030	these plants were so fragmentary that Swingle adopted a technique  developed by the Swedish botanist, H.O. Juel, for "restoring" critical  portions of a herbarium specimen so that they could be sectioned and  made into permanent slides for microscopic study. This method made it  possible to easily separate genera and species formerly in doubt. Its  effectiveness so impressed Swingle that he urged the University to undertake a long-range project to compile a reference collection of serial sections  of the critical parts of all tropical economic plants and their relatives,  including plants of potential economic importance. The collection was  to be used in general anatomical and morphological studies, and as an aid  to taxonomic studies of tropical economic plant groups. When the University expressed interest, Swingle suggested that I come to Washington  to learn these techniques, which I did. The University began "The Swingle  Project" in 1943 (it later became the Swingle Plant Research Laboratory),  I was hired to begin the work, and was associated with Dr. Swingle for  the remainder of his life. The Laboratory was discontinued in 1954.  What conditions and influences guide early mental development, and  lead to the life work and toward the manner of man that was Walter  Tennyson Swingle? The eldest child and only son of John Fletcher Swingle  and Mary Astley Swingle, a young hard-working progressive farm couple,  he was born to them on January 8, 1871, on a farm in Canaan Township,  Wayne County, Pennsylvania. When farm commodities and property  values fell in the panic of 1873, the family moved to Kansas. The Swingles  bought a hill farm near Manhattan, a cheerless town with a waste of  muddy, treeless streets lined with brick and wooden stores. The new  Kansas State College of Agriculture was nearby. The community was made  up essentially of conservative, Protestant, white, American-born, independent farmers with a strong bent for moral reform, a reaction to the  scandalous goings-on in the cattle towns. Two-year-old Walter began to  stammer badly.  The family's first full year of farming, 1874, coincided with a grasshopper plague and a severe drought; moreover, the hill farm proved to  have very poor soil. It was eventually sold, and another was purchased  on good prairie land. Miriam, his sister, was born. Walter was "five, going  on six" when the news came that General George Custer had made his  "last stand." In the fall, his parents sent him to the one-room rural school-  house, where he could hear the teacher give the children in all the other  grades their lessons; he could listen to all of them recite. By the time he  was nine he had sopped up the school's entire curriculum, so he stayed  home and worked on the farm, and his English-born mother gave him  lessons. In later years, Swingle looked upon this as an advantage; he felt  that formal schooling was turning out children who were much too regimented and standardized; children would develop faster and with more  originality if allowed to follow their natural interests. 	asu06600000300008001							67248344 Bytes	3908	5734	177621676	RGB	8	600	asu06600000300008001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/968	968	969.jp2	/asu0660/image/969.jp2
Walter Tennyson Swingle, 1871-1952					Venning, Frank D. (Frank Denmire), 1920-																											asu0660000030	As he grew up, Walter helped "Pa" cut wood, shock wheat, pick corn.  He herded their cows on the prairie, helped "Ma" churn butter, gather  eggs, pluck chickens the commonplace everyday and  seasonal  chores  of a midwestern family farm. It was not a lonely boyhood — there were  neighbors nearby. They visited, gave each other a hand at harvest, and  had children near Walter and Miriam's age who were his friends. He  and the other boys fished in the creek, spent the night at each other's  houses, made up games, slid down the haystack — did all the things young  farm boys do. When he was ten, he came across a copy of The Youth's  Companion, the magazine that generations of smalltown and farm boys  eagerly looked forward to receiving each month. He wanted to subscribe,  so "Ma paid me ten cents a churnfull for churning and I sent off for it."  Nor were the Swingles intellectually isolated. They could easily hitch  up the buggy and ride into town. They were concerned about local, state,  and national events, issues, decisions. The Kansas land boom of the early  Eighties, and the depression that followed, placed a burden on the farmers.  Discontent was strong among them, radical populist agrarian opinions  were voiced, and issues were publicly debated in town. The Swingles often  took Walter along, and he listened to "Resolved, that wealth has more  influence upon the central government than labor," "Resolved, that  Charles J. Guiteau was insane at the time of the asassination," and debates  of similar questions. However, the Swingles were not as bent on moral  reform as were their fellow Kansans. When Kansas went "dry" in 1880  (it stayed "dry" until 1949), "Pa and I gathered grapes in the woods,  and he made us wine."  Swingle loved the plants and the wildflowers he saw. If nobody could  tell him what they were, he made up names of his own for them. When  he found out that you could "look them up," he stopped by the College  and obtained a copy of Gray's Manual of Botany. He "looked up" his  plants, and became highly proficient in systematic botany before he had  much, if any, formal education. This set him apart as something of an  intellectual prodigy.  When he was fourteen, he lost his mother. She had "set out his  lessons" according to what she saw were his needs, had taken his interests  seriously, and had encouraged him in pursuing them. He had no difficulty  enrolling as a student at Kansas State College at the age of fifteen. In  this environment he rapidly developed, and his acumen and character  traits were revealed. He had a retentive memory and an intense, restless,  intellectual curiosity. His nimbleness of mind and imaginative insight  became apparent from the kind of questions he raised: "How long can a  weed seed lie in a field before it sprouts?" (No one knew the answer.)  "Why don't we try to get rid of weeds by introducing their diseases?"  (No one had ever thought of that.) "If we tried to hybridize corn, when  is the silk receptive to pollen? How long does it stay receptive?" (No  one had experimented to find out.) He was fortunate to come under  the influence of Professor William Ashbrook Kellerman, a pioneer in  the study of plant diseases. Swingle entered this field with enthusiasm; 	asu06600000300009001							66895672 Bytes	3897	5720	1444468810	RGB	8	600	asu06600000300009001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/969	969	970.jp2	/asu0660/image/970.jp2
Walter Tennyson Swingle, 1871-1952					Venning, Frank D. (Frank Denmire), 1920-																											asu0660000030	he was ambitious, hardworking, with a bulldog tenacity of purpose, and  he had a flair for discovery. By his sophomore year he was doing original  work, and published his first scientific paper jointly with Prof. Kellerman  in 1888. Between 1888 and 1891 he published 21 scientific articles in  joint authorship with Kellerman, varying from brief notes to papers of  considerable length, in addition to six original papers of which he was  the sole author.  When Swingle entered college in 1886, George Fairchild was the  college president, and his son David, two years Swingle's senior, was a  student there. When Swingle was just 16, he read a paper before the  College Scientific Society. David Fairchild was present, and later described  it:  "At one of the first meetings, a young classmate of mine, W.T.  Swingle, amazed us by delivering a scholarly address on the fungi which  cause such diseases as the wheat rust. It was an entirely new subject to  us, and we sat spellbound while he presented his discourse. Entranced,  we watched Swingle's long arms wave about and his piercing gray eyes  dart from one to the other of us. It gave me my first insight into the  great intellect of Swingle. It was from him that I first heard the word  "bacteria", and with it he opened for me the door into the world of  microscopic organisms. Delivering an address was a praiseworthy feat  for Swingle, as he was easily embarrassed and inclined to stammer."  Swingle struggled to overcome his stammer. He never really lost it,  but developed a way of speaking that kept it from being an impediment.  He spoke in a soft voice, pronouncing consonants very softly, and  occasionally omitted a glottal stop. His speech was fluent and rapid, but  required his listeners' close attention. His voice did not carry, and he  did not "come across" as a public speaker; if he raised his voice, or  attempted to shout, the stammer became apparent. When he was only  seventeen, two years before graduation, he was appointed to the position  of assistant botanist in the Agricultural Experiment Station.  It should be kept in mind that in the nineteenth century, comparatively little scientific work had been done or was under way in botany  or agriculture in America; it was, rather, the great period of European  scientific research, discovery, and development, led principally by German  and French institutions. As Swingle's familiarity with the literature increased, he quickly appreciated the importance of discriminating between  original and secondary sources. He realized that familiarity with the  American and English scientific publications was not enough — a reading  knowledge of other languages was essential, beginning with technical  German. He took formal German courses, but did not acquire the facility  he wanted. It was typical of him to look for help elsewhere, and so he  went to the immigrant German laborer whose job it was to feed the pigs  at the Experiment Station! With this man's help and his own tenacity,  he mastered the German language.  8 	asu06600000300010001							67010028 Bytes	3896	5731	1780390912	RGB	8	600	asu06600000300010001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/970	970	971.jp2	/asu0660/image/971.jp2
Walter Tennyson Swingle, 1871-1952					Venning, Frank D. (Frank Denmire), 1920-																											asu0660000030	Swingle graduated from Kansas State in 1890 with a B.S. degree.  Although only nineteen, he was already a competent plant taxonomist,  an able research worker, had published original work in mycology and  plant pathology, in genetic phenomena and characteristics of hybrids, and  had become something of a bibliophile. Warm-natured but shy, he had  shown little overt interest in girls. His steadiness of purpose did not  permit emotional or physical distractions. Thrills came from accomplishment and discovery, excitement from sharing and discussing his findings  with his peers.  To describe the next fifty years of Swingle's career in one short phrase  one might say it was an astonishing accomplishment, accompanied by  increasing frustration. Some insight into the reasons for his frustration is  afforded by a critical look at his training and education. While growing  up and while in college, he had never been confined within a planned,  orderly, day-by-day routine; he had always had sizeable amounts of unorganized time for following up ideas, for spur-of-the-moment activities as  his thoughts or interests led. He had no training in the principles of  agricultural economics, economic theory in general, or in business or  finance, nor did he ever take any interest in these subjects. He immediately  recognized and appreciated fine craftsmanship in all its forms, but had little  interest in or knowledge of the fine arts. Yet he was an artist, in the sense  that a creative artist does not express ideas that are being expressed by  everyone else.  Further insight is gained by keeping in mind that Swingle's formative  years lay in the nineteenth century. His conceptual approach to solving a  problem or turning an idea into reality was the linear approach of that  century: To begin at one end and hope to come out at the other; not the  three-dimensional conceptual approach of the twentieth century, which  first envisions the completed whole, and then the elements required to  achieve it. Throughout Swingle's career he was often out-of-step with his  times, his ideas in advance of their time of acceptance, his method of  approach seeming disorderly, wasteful, with ill-defined goals, in the eyes  of the administrators of the twentieth century.  In 1891 Dr. Beverly Thomas Galloway, Chief of the Section of Vegetable Pathology of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, offered Swingle an  appointment (David Fairchild had joined the Section in 1889). Swingle  was only twenty, and unable to accept without parental permission. In  1891 he became the seventh member of that tiny group of research men,  all scarcely more than boys. It was a time when the Department was  beginning to concern itself with the great fruit-growing regions of the South  and Southwest. Citrus grove owners had been complaining to the Department for a number of years about the diseases attacking their trees, and  were urging that control measures be sought. In the summer of 1891,  Swingle was sent to make a survey of the more important orange-growing  regions of Florida. The town of Eustis, in Lake County, was in the heart of  the citrus belt, and he started there. Oranges are such a common fruit  today that it is hard to realize that at that time they were a rarity in the 	asu06600000300011001							66703260 Bytes	3896	5705	1091615353	RGB	8	600	asu06600000300011001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/971	971	972.jp2	/asu0660/image/972.jp2

Swingle used to tell of his first day  at Eustis:  I walked the hot sandy streets of that little town that afternoon, looking at all  the strange plants. A house at the edge of town had an orange tree on each side of  the gate, covered with big reddish oranges. I asked those people if I could buy some.  'Sonny', they said, 'you can have all those oranges you want; they won't cost you a  cent/ So I went back to town, looked up the hardware store, bought the biggest pail  they had, then went back to the house and started to pick. The people in the house  waved and smiled, so I went ahead and filled my pail. I walked back to a shady spot,  sat down and peeled an orange, and put about half of it in my mouth. For a minute  I couldn't believe what was happening — it burned and tasted like a cupful of pure  acid — I thought I was poisoned! I knew I'd made a bad mistake, and decided right  then that I had a lot to learn about oranges, and I'd better get busy if I wanted to  stay in business. (The trees were the Sour Orange, Citrus aurantium).  He did get busy; he examined groves and talked with growers at twenty-  six towns in fourteen counties. He stayed two months, studied a number of  diseases, and wrote to Dr. Galloway that "I found the reports of damage to  citrus not exaggerated, and no substantial preventative measures being taken,  due largely to the obscure nature of the maladies." The growers wanted a  federally-sponsored program to eradicate the most prevalent and destructive  diseases; Swingle had them sign petitions, and took these back to  Washington.  There were no funds for further action until March, 1892, when Swingle  was again sent to Florida. In June, he came across a grower who had made  "many exceedingly valuable crosses" of citrus. He immediately sensed the  new potentialities, and began to study orange pollination. Meanwhile, the  citizens of Lake County offered to erect a laboratory at Eustis, and to donate  enough land for experimental field work. When the Section's appropriation  was increased in July to equip a laboratory, Swingle was recalled to Washington to plan the facilities and its work. There were funds for an assistant  and he selected Herbert John Webber, a young graduate student at the  Shaw School of Botany, studying under Dr. William Trelease.  Swingle and Webber returned to Eustis to supervise construction of the  laboratory which was completed in 1893. They studied the anatomy and  physiology of healthy and diseased orange trees, and Swingle began making  new citrus hybrids — a slow, long-term project — hoping to develop new,  disease-resistant fruits and rootstocks.  Swingle worked at Eustis until the summer of 1895. By 1894, sooty  mold, a destructive disease of the fruits, had been controlled; lemon scab,  another very troublesome disease, had been checked; and the more obscure  diseases such as blight, foot rot, and dieback had been studied and much  new information compiled. But these and other problems were not amenable  to easy solution. By 1893, Swingle and Webber were convinced that to  insure success, a scientific subtropical horticulture was needed, and that to  achieve it they needed taxonomic, morphological, anatomical, and physio-  10 	asu06600000300012001							66449440 Bytes	3888	5695	999991304	RGB	8	600	asu06600000300012001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/972	972	973.jp2	/asu0660/image/973.jp2
Walter Tennyson Swingle, 1871-1952					Venning, Frank D. (Frank Denmire), 1920-																											asu0660000030	logical studies of the orange tree and its fruits — in short, science in the  exact, pure form. Swingle conceived an ambitious long-range research program that also included the search for and introduction of new species and  relatives of citrus, to be used for breeding experiments for disease resistance.  He expanded this latter concept to formulate a program for the introduction  and study of other foreign plants that might be useful in Florida. Swingle  was pioneering when he proposed these programs, and the reaction was  mixed. The growers wanted practical results in disease control, and that was  all that they wanted. They did not see how all these new studies would be of  any use to them; it was not the reason they had donated their land and their  money. In Washington, his chief had to compete with other sections of the  Department for appropriations, and practical results counted. He also had  to assign priorities in his own section, which was responsible for federal  plant disease studies and control throughout the entire country. Although  Galloway saw merit in the proposal, execution of such a program implied  a large budget over an indefinite number of years, to be spent in the hope  that the information acquired would include data applicable to solving the  problems.  Swingle saw that he had a public relations job on his hands. He had to  prepare reports to Washington, explaining in detail his findings and  reasons for including specific study projects in the program. He had to  educate the public as well, so more time was spent giving addresses to  growers and writing articles of a popular nature. All this on top of his  regular work. From 1892 through 1895 he published 21 scientific papers,  and was the sole author of all but three of them. He kept close track of  literature in his field and was determined to study at the University of  Bonn under Herr Doktor-Professor Eduard Strasburger, a leader in  anatomical and cytological research. The great freeze in the winter of  1894-95 provided the opportunity. There had been no freeze like it since  1835, when hundred-year-old orange trees had been killed to the ground.  In late 1894, the growers had been expecting to harvest six million boxes of  citrus. The freeze arrived just before picking was to begin, freezing the  fruits solid, and killing the trees back to mere stumps. All the new hybrids,  laboriously made by hand pollinations and carefully nurtured, were killed.  It would be fourteen years before Florida again reached the same level of  production. Swingle did what he could, studying cold damage, and assessing  the magnitude of the disaster. He then requested permission to take leave,  and in late summer sailed to join Fairchild at Bonn.  The intense intellectual atmosphere of the University of Bonn was a  surprise to Swingle. The students were thinkers, the professors leaders in  their fields. His chemistry professor, Dr. Friedrich Kekul6, theorized that  the carbon atoms in a molecule of benzene were arranged in a hexagonal  ring — a revolutionary idea of fundamental significance. Strasburger's  cytological discoveries, his concept that chromosomes were the carriers of  heredity, his mastery of the new science of the cell, inspired his students,  who spent their days and their nights bent over their microscopes. Strasburger greeted them each morning by asking, "Have you found anything  11 	asu06600000300013001							67263908 Bytes	3926	5709	2720173689	RGB	8	600	asu06600000300013001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/973	973	974.jp2	/asu0660/image/974.jp2

One November morning he came in carrying a photograph, and  instead of the usual greeting, said, "Gentlemen, my friend Rontgen has  just made an amazing, unprecedented discovery. It will be of the greatest  use to surgery." Strasburger then showed them the now historic first X-ray  photograph of the key, the ring, and the purse.  Swingle's cytological research at Bonn proved for the first time the  existence of centrosomes in plant cells, a subject that had been hotly  debated. Although his proof settled debate, he was disappointed that his  discovery was never found to be of any particular significance. But his  studies prepared the way for his later work in genetics. He also learned a  bit of philosophy from Strasburger that proved useful later on. One day an  excited student ran into the laboratory with a new issue of a botanical  journal, shouting, "Herr Professor! You've been attacked!" Strasburger  calmed the student by replying, "Oh, that's all right. If what I said is true,  it will stand up. But if there's new evidence that proves me wrong, we'll all  learn something from it."  In the summer of 1896, Swingle occupied the Smithsonian Chair at  the Marine Zoological Institute at Naples, Italy to continue studies of the  cell, returning in the fall to the laboratory at Eustis.  On the basis of his studies abroad and his published reasearch, his  alma mater, Kansas State College, conferred on him the Master of Science  degree in the fall of 1896. The next twelve months were spent in plant-  breeding work. The freeze of '95 convinced Swingle that cold-hardiness  should be included among the objectives of the citrus breeding program.  He also became interested in pineapple breeding. An idea of the intensity  of his efforts at that time is gained from his monthly report for March,  1897: "I have just finished crossing the orange and the pineapple . . .  Crossed nearly 600 flowers of the orange and over 700 of the pineapple.  So far I have about 110 oranges 'set' and hope I will get about 75 to  ripen."  This pioneer period of citrus breeding, begun by Swingle and Webber,  was continued by one or both of them through 1899. They crossed choice  oranges and other citrus fruits with the extremely hardy trifoliate orange  (Poncirus trifoliata), which stands the winters well as far north as Washington, and is even grown out-of-doors in Philadelphia. The seeds obtained  from crossing were sown in greenhouses in Washington. A total of 1,780  seedlings were grown, but not all of them proved to be hybrids; some  seedlings originated from nucellar embryos. The hybrids were tested in  Florida, mostly in cooperation with growers, by grafting buds of the hybrid  seedling onto well-established citrus trees. This innovation hastened  fruiting, so that most of them flowered and fruited within three or four  years. Thus their quality and character could be judged much more  quickly, and the hybrids could be used as parents for making more complex  combinations. When tests proved that hardiness was transmitted to the  progeny by the trifoliate orange parent, Swingle suggested the possibility  of extending citrus culture as far north as the Carolinas. But resistance to  12 	asu06600000300014001							66274392 Bytes	3873	5702	442007047	RGB	8	600	asu06600000300014001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/974	974	975.jp2	/asu0660/image/975.jp2

David Fairchild had resigned from the Department in 1893 to study  and travel in Europe. Continuing east to Java, he traveled in Southeast  Asia and the South Pacific, and arrived back in Washington in the fall of  1897. By then it was apparent to some officials of the Department that  they needed a systematic plant introduction program, and Fairchild was  hired to plan and organize it. He sought Swingle's help, and the two men  took the lead in securing the creation, in 1897-98, of the Office of Seed  and Plant Introduction. Fairchild was placed in charge. Both he and  Swingle conceived of this work as an integral part of the progressive  program of experimental research being expanded in every division and  laboratory of the Department. That same fall of 1897 Swingle and Webber  established the first Plant Introduction Garden, on the land donated by  Mrs. Brickell in Miami.  The new Office could not be funded until Congress appropriated funds  for the next fiscal year, which would begin in July, 1898, at which time  it was understood that Swingle would transfer to plant introduction work.  Meanwhile, the Office of Pomology wanted introductions of European  table grapes and Swingle was interested in a term of study under Pfeffer  and Ostwald at the University of Leipzig. The two objectives were combined, and Swingle went to Leipzig in the spring of 1898. This date  marked the beginning of his research as an agricultural explorer. He  remained abroad through 1900, the work taking him to France, Sicily,  Italy, North Africa, Greece, and Asia Minor. Before starting out on his  travels, he and Fairchild drew up plant lists. Swingle was to emphasize  crop plants suitable for the South and especially for the Southwest, where  crops tolerant of desert conditions and saline or alkaline soils were needed.  The list included Egyptian cotton, melons, wine and raisin grapes, citrons,  olives, pistachios, Smyrna-type figs, and the like, but when Fairchild said,  "Tenny, you've got to bring back some good date palms," Swingle exclaimed, "My land, David! We'll be old men before we can get a date  industry going." Nevertheless, date palms went on the list.  Merely collecting and introducing a new crop plant is not enough.  Successful cultivation requires scientific knowledge and practical understanding of the crop. Swingle planned to study in the libraries of France  and other nations, to consult agriculturists and growers, to study the crops  in the field — in short, he wished to obtain all available information on  ecological and cultural requirements, production and preparation techniques.  There would be problems enough in launching new crops or improving old  ones; to begin without the available information could lead to disaster.  That spring, while studying at Leipzig, Swingle sought a tutor to  increase his proficiency in French, and was referred to Mile. Lucie  Romstaedt, a well-educated German-Alsatian who had "gone French".  Lucie was an accomplished pianist, skilled in the art of conversation and  13 	asu06600000300015001							66936600 Bytes	3911	5703	1042011797	RGB	8	600	asu06600000300015001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/975	975	976.jp2	/asu0660/image/976.jp2

She liked the shy, handsome "rich American" and his  boyish seriousness. Reluctantly, although more confident of his French, he  left Leipzig for the libraries of Paris.  One of the tasks Swingle now undertook was to solve the enigma of  Smyrna-type figs. Private Smyrna fig orchards had been set out in  California, but the fruits did not ripen properly. A fig is hollow inside, and  flowers cover the surface of this cavity; a single fine pore leads outside. A  tiny wasp, a Blastophaga, enters this opening and pollinates the flowers;  only this insect can do it. Furthermore, Smyrna fig trees bear figs containing only female flowers; they will not ripen without pollination, and  the insect does not live in their fruits. Where was the wasp, and where did  it get pollen? When existing literature and scientists could not give him  the answer, Swingle went to talk to peasant farmers who grew Smyrna figs.  They all told him the same story. The wasps live and develop inside wild  inedible figs called caprifigs, and over-winter in them. Caprifigs have only  male flowers, full of pollen. The farmers showed him how they gathered  caprifigs just before the wasps emerged, and hung them in their Smyrna  fig trees, or how they grew caprifigs among the Smyrnas in their orchards.  Swingle was convinced he had the answers, but when he discussed it with  European scientific authorities, they disagreed. It was unthinkable that  the peasants should know something they did not know. He was told that  these were only peasant superstitions, that nothing would be gained by  introducing caprifigs and Blastophagas into  California.  But as Swingle saw it, he had to do two things. He had to introduce  caprifig trees to California so that the insects could be perpetuated — no  great problem — and he had to get living fig insects to California at exactly  the right time. In 1898 he faced, and in 1899 overcame, difficult problems  to accomplish this goal. The wasps lay dormant inside caprifigs during  winter, but once they emerged their lives were short. They developed  rapidly in warmth. The insects had to arrive in California at just the right  stage of development, so that their emergence coincided with the flowering  of caprifigs and Smyrna figs. He succeeded by working his way from Sicily  up the Italian boot, and from lowland to mountain-top orchards along the  way, collecting caprifigs with wasps in different stages of development and  wrapping them in the only suitable material he could find, the foil liners  in packs of Italian cigarettes. To insure arrival, he sent hundreds of separate  collections via steamer in the diplomatic pouches. By 1900 the Smyrna figs  in California ripened good crops. It was a noteworthy accomplishment, and  he was proud of it.  But this was not to be the end of the story. In California, the figs had  thicker, tougher skins than when grown in the lands of the Mediterranean.  Although excellent when eaten fresh, the cured figs did not compete with  imported Smyrna figs. And then a curious thing occurred. A sustained  effort was made to prove that the Smyrna fig insect had already been  established in California prior to Swingle's introductions in 1899. Although  there is no doubt that the insect's general distribution in the Smyrna fig  orchards of California dates from Swingle's work, there is evidence that  14 	asu06600000300016001							66557212 Bytes	3880	5716	1327790313	RGB	8	600	asu06600000300016001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/976	976	977.jp2	/asu0660/image/977.jp2
Walter Tennyson Swingle, 1871-1952					Venning, Frank D. (Frank Denmire), 1920-																											asu0660000030	Mr. George Roeding, a private grower near Fresno, had successfully established the fig insect in his orchards in 1896, and that the wasp had become  accidentally established on the Gates farm near Modesto, about 1866.  Swingle's interest in and work on improving fig production in California  continued through 1910. Between 1899 and 1910 he published 12 studies  pertaining to Smyrna-type figs.  It was also in 1898 that Swingle began his now classic studies of date  palms. At that time (and today as well) the United States imported  thousands of tons of dates each fall from Basra, Khorramshahr, and Muscat.  These dark brown dates were mostly of the Fard variety, a very sweet sticky  date, that was stamped into large, oozing, rectangular masses by the Arabs'  feet, then wrapped in burlap, and shipped. Although every American grocer  had a block of them on the counter and sold them by tearing off chunks  with an icepick, most of the tonnage was for the baking industry. Fairchild  and Swingle did not envision an American date industry in competition  with these cheap bulk imports. Their aim was to develop the production  of select fresh table and dessert dates, none of which had ever been avilable  on the American market.  Each traditional date-growing region in the world cultivates varieties  chosen to some extent for their suitability to a particular set of climatic  conditions. Swingle began by making comparative ecological studies of  North African date-growing regions and of the available areas for date  culture in Arizona and California. He then made a detailed study of date  varieties and cultural methods in Algeria and Morocco, living with  Bedouins and Berbers, visiting the oases of the interior, and obtaining all  pertinent information, even detailed descriptions of tools and implements  and how they were used. His U.S.D.A. Bulletin 53, Date Palm was the  first comprehensive monograph on dates and date culture; even the French  savants were impressed.  In the date, male and female flowers are borne on separate palms.  When cultivated, only a few males are kept, and the females are pollinated  by hand. Young date palms produce suckers or offshoots near the base,  and these are used to propagate a selection or variety; seedlings are too  variable, and half of them are males. A date palm produces only a few  offshoots each year. An offshoot starts to send out roots of its own after  three to five years' growth on the parent palm, and at this stage will weigh  40 to 75 pounds or more. It can now be cut free from the parent, grown in a  nursery for a year, then be set out in the date garden. An offshoot will  usually reach full bearing by its tenth year in the garden, and will continue  to bear until its hundredth year, but by then it is so tall that the owner's  assets have grown out of sight. A single rooted offshoot of a choice variety,  requires fifty years or more to accumulate enough offshoots to make a one-  acre test planting of 48 palms to the acre.  The problems and responsibilities Swingle faced are obvious. A number  of promising varieties could be introduced on a small scale for future  consideration, but to get the American date industry started, it would have  15 	asu06600000300017001							67078128 Bytes	3909	5718	2683025138	RGB	8	600	asu06600000300017001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/977	977	978.jp2	/asu0660/image/978.jp2
Walter Tennyson Swingle, 1871-1952					Venning, Frank D. (Frank Denmire), 1920-																											asu0660000030	to be based on a few standard top-quality varieties, in order that the  consumer be educated as to their names and characteristics, and learn to  rely on them. It was necessary for Swingle to make judgments as to flavor,  texture, desirable size, keeping qualities, sweetness, susceptibility to insects,  diseases, rain, yield ability, evenness of ripening, adaptability to the Southwest— a myriad of factors to weigh in choosing the best varieties with  which to start. Then he had to locate, inspect, buy, pack, crate, and ship  enough rooted offshoots of each, so that trials could begin without delay.  His introductions included the Deglet Noor, a sweet, semi-dry dessert date  of rich, distinctive flavor but easily damaged by rain, a variety that now  dominates the plantings in the Coachella Valley; the Medjhool, another  semi-dry dessert date, which is gaining importance among American growers; and the Thoory, an excellent large dry date, tolerant of humidity and  not sticky, which can be carried loose in a coat pocket without harm to  date or pocket. The latter is little known outside the Southwest.  In the year 1900, Swingle was put in charge of establishing the American  date industry; he also was to continue his work on citrus and on other  crops. The Office of Crop Physiology and Breeding Investigations was  established, with Swingle appointed Principal Physiologist in Charge, a  position he held until 1934. But the immediate decade to come, 1901-1910,  was the most tumultuous in his life.  The American phase of the date project was not clear sailing; unforeseen problems came thick and fast. Establishing the industry was not going  to be a mere routine of testing, then multiplying and distributing offshoots.  Date work took much of Swingle's time through 1907, and he continued  research on the date until 1932. But the first decade was the hardest, nor  were all the problems of a technical nature.  Seeding date palms had long been grown in the Southwest for ornament  or as curiosities; when promoters and nurserymen heard that a date industry  was contemplated, they tried to cash in by selling offshoots of these seedlings to prospective growers. But these were a miscellany of unstandardized  types, and most were similar to Fards, the cheap imported bulk dates. The  Department recognized that plantings of these mixed, largely inferior varieties would lead to commercial disaster, but even some prospective growers  were enticed because offshoots were available, and no one knew when they  would be able to get offshoots of the new introductions. These people were  persistent; they put pressure on Swingle, on the Department in Washington,  on their senators and congressmen. Swingle found he had an educational  campaign and a long battle on his hands. He handled it by making tactful,  closely-reasoned replies, and finally won his point.  Then it was discovered that although the imported offshoots had been  fumigated and declared free of insects, the North African Marlatt scale  insect had penetrated deep within the layers of the terminal buds, had  survived fumigation, and was flourishing in the experimental plots. Existing  fumigants and insecticides killed it on the exposed parts of the palms, but  none reached it down inside the buds. After much trial, it was found that  16 	asu06600000300018001							67070832 Bytes	3912	5713	3002167194	RGB	8	600	asu06600000300018001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/978	978	979.jp2	/asu0660/image/979.jp2

(Frank Denmire), 1920-																											asu0660000030	i  the scales could be killed by prolonged heating at a temperature nearly lethal  to the offshoot. The technology was worked out, large ovens built, temperature controls developed; the offshoots were dug up, slowly heated to high  temperature, soaked in this heat, then slowly cooled. Most offshoots survived, and the scale was eradicated. It was a slow discouraging setback.  An embarrassing problem arose with the Deglet Noor, on which Swingle  had pinned such high hopes. In the trial plantings, it set bumper crops of  dates, but they would not ripen. Treatment after treatment was tried, singly  and in combination, all without success. Each season, new treatments were  devised and tried, but Deglet Noors still did not ripen. Finally, Swingle was  asked to call on the Secretary of Agriculture. When he was shown in, the  Secretary shook hands, offered him a chair, and said, "Mr. Swingle, I called  you in to congratulate you." As Swingle told it, "When he said that, I sat up  straight! I didn't know what was coming. Then the Secretary said to me, 'I  think you have proved, beyond the slightest doubt, that the Deglet Noor will  not succeed in America.' I said, 'Mr. Secretary, I confess that up to now it  hasn't been too promising, but could you give us one more year? We've set  up some new tests, and think they might give us the answer. If they don't,  I'll be ready to call it quits with the Deglet Noor." The Secretary concurred,  and Swingle went ahead. The new tests involved treating the bunches of  dates, while still on the palm, with gasses which might induce ripening. A  glassblower had made large cylinders that could be slipped over the bunches  and the ends sealed, but big as the cylinders were, a part of the cluster had  to be pruned away to fit the rest inside. To their amazement, all of the dates  in all of these tests ripened, no matter the treatment. They had the answer:  Under American conditions, the Deglet Noor set far more fruits than the  tree could ripen, but did not drop part and ripen the rest; all that was  needed was to thin the bunches as a standard cultural practice.  By 1904, the citrus hybrids were coming into fruit; as they did, Swingle  studied, tested, and described them in thirteen papers published between  1905 and 1910. The tangelos (crosses between tangerines and grapefruits)  showed great promise as a new fruit for commercial production; the  citranges (crosses between sweet and trifoliate oranges) were variable, but  some had acceptable fruit, and were hardy enough to grow 400 miles north  of the Florida citrus belt. Other hybrids were described, but none proved  valuable as fruit; they were of genetic interest. Florida growers had mixed  emotions about these new hybrids. Apparently they ought to be prepared  for any number of new, possibly very superior, citrus fruits to appear at any  time; the tangelos gave some growers a feeling of insecurity. A bearing  orange grove represents a large capital investment. Might not these new  fruits make their groves obsolete and consequently reduce the value of  their property? Nevertheless, in 1908 Swingle launched a new citrus-  breeding program in Florida, assisted by F.W. Savage and his son, Maurice,  and produced a large number of hybrids from many combinations of  varieties and species.  Although dates and citrus were Swingle's major concerns at this time,  his work was by no means restricted to them. He believed in using every  17 	asu06600000300019001							68966852 Bytes	4003	5741	2481150383	RGB	8	600	asu06600000300019001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/979	979	980.jp2	/asu0660/image/980.jp2

In cytology, he studied and published, with Dr. O.F. Cook, on  the evolution of cellular structures. Recognizing the resemblance between  the mitotic figure in dividing cells and a magnetic field, he wondered if a  magnetic field were involved and persuaded Dr. Lyman J. Briggs to join  him in subjecting dividing animal cells to high electromagnetic fields.  Coming across a paper by Sir Oliver Lodge, that claimed a great increase  in yield from plants subjected to high-voltage static electricity, he sent one  of his cytologists, Dr. William Seifriz, to work with Dr. Briggs in testing  Lodge's findings. For three years they stimulated everything, but only Dr.  Briggs and a government mule were visibly affected. With Briggs, Swingle  worked on developing the ultraviolet microscope and ultraviolet photography as new cytological research tools; he became interested in optics  and persuaded Zeiss to make a lens of diamond based solely on his calculations. Other "minor" activities included breeding experiments with  Egyptian cotton, studies on pistachio-nut cultivation, the prevention of  smut in wheat and oats, and work on Smyrna figs. By the close of the year  1910, he was the sole or joint author of a total of 96 separate publications.  As the chief of an office, Swingle was saddled with administrative  duties for the first time in his life. He had a way of inspiring his employees,  conveying to them the joy of scientific research and the mental satisfaction  of observation and discovery, and he helped them to develop into highly-  qualified professionals. But nothing in his background or experience had  prepared him for other aspects of administration, nor did he have the  temperament or point of view of an administrator. Yet in this position he  was required to make plans several years in advance, prepare budgets in  advance according to those plans, determine staffing needs, give work  assignments, supervise and manage employees, evaluate their job performance, set up routines, develop an organization. All of this was foreign to  his way of doing things. New ideas were constantly whisking around in his  head (in fact, the saying became commonplace throughout the Bureau,  "We'll never run out of ideas as long as Swingle's around"). He was  always impatient to try out his ideas and the Department was often put to  it to decide whether to try to curb his enthusiasm or let him have his way  at the risk of a fiasco. Under his management the office budget was always  spent before the year was out. He would cancel employees' vacations at the  last minute, make spur-of-the-moment trips to California, Arizona, Florida,  wherever, not knowing how long he would be gone; he would leave the  staff to pick up and carry on without instructions, and then rage when he  got back if they had not known all that he had in mind. At the same time,  his superiors were storming at him for undertaking unscheduled projects,  for not documenting methods and objectives, for running out of funds at  midyear. He never actually mastered the art of administration, but this  first decade was the most trying period.  Not only was Swingle's career tumultuous between 1901-1910; so also  werehis personal life and affairs, for on June 8, 1901, he married the  beautiful and charming Mile.

He completely lost his head, and was  helplessly in love.  Money had never meant much to Swingle. He knew nothing about  managing it, and had never needed to learn. He was not a hedonist, had  conservative tastes, a quiet lifestyle, had no interest in accumulating personal  possessions other than useful books. Since his salary had always been  generous in relation to his needs, he had always spent whatever he wanted  whenever he wanted, without having to consider if he were keeping within  his means. He continued to handle his personal finances in this way after  his marriage.  The Swingles set up housekeeping in Washington. Lucie was smart,  stylish, social. She dabbled in botany to please him, but her idea of the  good life did not include a quick meal at the corner cafe, followed by an  evening of him and his friends "talking shop." She wanted parties, dancing,  clothes, furs, jewels, opening nights at the theater, and champagne suppers.  She would go with him on his trips, but now they stayed at the grand  hotels, sent the waiters for vintage wines and fruits out-of-season. Eventually  the Swingles were deeply in debt, the rent was always due, the mails a  flutter of unpaid bills.  When they got so far behind in the rent that the landlord began proceedings to evict them things finally came to a head. Swingle found himself  in the humiliating position of having to go to his colleagues, hat in hand.  They lent him the money, and he and Lucie set out on the short walk to  the landlord's. On the way, they passed a bookstore with a brand new  edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica in the window. They stopped to  look, went in for a closer look, then spent the evening back home thumbing through their new Britannica. When Swingle found himself in the  ridiculous position of going to his colleagues again the next day for the rent  money, older, wiser heads took him in hand. They found how chaotic his  finances were, pointed out where he was headed, showed him that even  his career was threatened, and talked some sense into him. He came away  shaken and chastened, but grateful to them.  When he explained their position to Lucie, and what they had to do  — the cutting back, the budget, the new quiet life — she paid no attention,  but kept right on spending, running up bills they could not possibly pay.  In 1910 Lucie died of typhoid, whereupon Swingle moved to a room  in the home of his good friends Dr. and Mrs. O.F. Cook. He plunged more  intensely than ever into his career, and gradually paid off his debts.  By this time work on the date was becoming routine, and Swingle was  turning to the problems of citrus. He now had twenty years' experience  with this crop, and a broad knowledge of what was needed.  A knowledge of plant diseases and their control was still a major  concern; there was a constant threat that diseases from elsewhere could  be introduced accidentally. Stringent inspection and quarantine measures  were necessary for all plants and seeds introduced into the country. And  19 	asu06600000300021001							67513832 Bytes	3920	5739	3005044723	RGB	8	600	asu06600000300021001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/981	981	982.jp2	/asu0660/image/982.jp2

An example had just appeared in  Florida — citrus canker, a destructive Old World bacterial disease of the  tree and its fruits, which was spreading unchecked.  The breeding experiments had given such promising results that they  should be continued. It appeared that disease-resistant trees and rootstocks  could be developed. Swingle saw that a great horticultural industry based  on just two or three susceptible varieties could be totally wiped out by the  introduction and spread of a new disease. So far, the breeding experiments  had been based on the relatively few genera, species, and varieties of citrus  and citrus relatives available in this country, whereas he felt the breeding  program should have available all citrus relatives that offered desirable  characteristics, in other words, a much larger pool of genetic material. But  how many relatives were there? What were their characteristics? Where  were they found? How could living material be obtained? The botanical  literature was confusing, the descriptions of genera and species inadequate.  It became clear that yet another task was required. To determine what  the germplasm bank contained, it was necessary to straighten out the  taxonomic confusion.  By 1911 Swingle was working on all these problems. He presented his  findings of imperfect dominance in first-generation citrus hybrids at the  IV International Genetic Congress in Paris, then studied the type specimens of citrus and its relatives in the Paris herbarium; he went on to Spain  to study citrus canker and how it was controlled there.  Canker appeared in Florida in 1910. If uncontrolled it would wipe out  the citrus industry, for there was no cure. Only a few tangerines appeared  safe. In cooperation with the Federal Plant Quarantine Board, Swingle  devised stringent control measures. Infected trees were dug up and burned,  roots and all, the soil sterilized. Antiseptic methods were adopted to prevent  spread of the disease on hands, tools, or clothing. All groves and nurseries,  all dooryard trees were inspected. Both federal and state agencies carried  out the control measures, and canker was finally eradicated from Florida  in 1926, after an expenditure of over six million dollars and the destruction  of 257,745 trees and 3,093,110 nursery plants. According to Swingle, it  would have been eradicated much sooner, except for a problem with a  nurseryman:  We had the disease mapped out over the whole state, the infected areas quarantined, and were inspecting and cleaning up district by district. We were taking the  strictest precautions. But canker kept breaking out in districts that had been thoroughly cleaned up, and it would turn up in districts declared free of it. We couldn't  understand it. Finally a pattern emerged; it had to be coming from infected nursery  stock sold by a nursery we had inspected right along without ever finding any trace  of canker. We called in, one by one, all the inspectors who had ever been there, and  had them tell us all they could remember about that nursery. They all remembered  it well, and the story was always the same: the owner was friendly, cooperative, and  20 	asu06600000300022001							67177088 Bytes	3910	5725	885641051	RGB	8	600	asu06600000300022001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/982	982	983.jp2	/asu0660/image/983.jp2

Afterward they'd go out and inspect the nursery, and it was always clean, they'd never  found any canker on a single leaf of his plants.  It all sounded fine. The only thing we could put our finger on was that there  was always a two or three hours' delay from the time they arrived until they got into  the nursery. Was it possible that . . . ? So we sent out the regular team again, told  them to do it the usual way. We sent a second team behind them, to go straight to  the nursery after the first team was inside the house half an hour. We got the  answer. That man had his whole field force going down the rows, picking off every  leaf that showed a canker, putting them in sacks. We put him out of business in a  hurry.  The year 1911 held a pleasant surprise for Swingle. He had the great  good fortune to meet Miss Maude Kellerman, the youngest daughter of his  former professor, W.A. Kellerman. Kellerman had left Kansas State during  the radical Populist takeover of the college in the early 90s, and was chairman of the Botany Department at Ohio State University. His son, Karl,  had come to work for Swingle several years earlier. Mrs. Kellerman and  Maude came to Washington to visit Karl. Swingle had not seen Mrs.  Kellerman since his school days in Kansas, and had never met Maude, who  was only twenty-three. Mrs. Kellerman, a strongwilled independent woman,  was flattered and pleased with the attention Swingle showed them. She  was something less than pleased when she found that his attentions were  actually directed at Maude, who was also strongwilled and independent,  but who had the good sense not to make a point of it. Swingle found  himself more than interested in this pretty, vivacious, sensible, and intelligent girl. They had much in common. At eighteen, Maude had successfully  taken over editorship and publication of the Journal of Mycology and the  Mycological Bulletin. Although she had traveled with her family in Europe  in lieu of finishing high school, she was admitted to Ohio State University,  where she completed her B.A. degree in just two years, picking up a Phi  Beta Kappa key along the way. She did further study at the University of  Lausanne and in Madrid, and was fluent in French, German, Spanish, and  Italian. She did not claim to be a botanist, but knew more botany than  most botanists. She liked Swingle, and when the Department offered her a  position as a botanical translator, she accepted, partly to see how things  developed, partly because her mother was so outspokenly opposed to the  whole idea. Swingle was in and out of Washington over the next three  years. When he was in town, he saw a lot of Maude. She understood his  work, and could talk with him about it, adding some helpful ideas of her  own. He was enormously impressed when she demonstrated that citrus  pollen could be kept viable long enough to ship half-way around the world,  or could be held in good condition to bridge the time gaps between flowering of different species, making their hybridization possible for the first  time. It was clear to everyone that he was captivated by her, but was afraid  to trust his heart. Realizing finally that he could not live without her, he  saw that the only thing to fear was not winning her. They were married  21 	asu06600000300023001							67640360 Bytes	3926	5741	3339534216	RGB	8	600	asu06600000300023001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/983	983	984.jp2	/asu0660/image/984.jp2

Swingle never ceased to wonder at her versatility, her  adaptability, the seeming ease with which she could accomplish things, and  he came to depend more and more on her advice and help in his work.  He was always amazed at her talent as a manager. She was, as he said, "a  truly remarkable woman."  The Swingles' first children, boy and girl twins, John William and  Stella, were born in 1920. He was a proud father, and wrote in his notebook "Red letter dayV A second son, Frank, was bom in 1923; a second  daughter, Mary, in 1928. He was devoted to them. He and John loved to  argue about every subject under the sun. With Stella, there were long  walks while they conversed in French. Frank was becoming an engineer  while still a boy, and they had long talks about the "dozenal" system of  counting — Frank even made a slide rule for this system. With Mary there  were long chess games.  But to return to 1910: Swingle's studies to straighten out the classification and descriptions of citrus and its relatives had led him to explore the  history of the cultivated varieties. The genus Citrus is native to Southeast  Asia, and has long been cultivated in China. There were records and  descriptions in the Chinese literature and a collection of Chinese books at  the Library of Congress, so he had sought help there. By a series of coincidences, this led to his taking on and accomplishing in fifteen years,  merely as a sideline, what would have been a fulltime career for most  persons, the guidance of the development of the Oriental Collection in  the Library of Congress.  Until 1898, the Chinese collection in the Library of Congress was a  miscellany of minor books, mostly uncatalogued and therefore unavailable  for general use. The collection had never been rounded out to cover any  special fields of knowledge and could not be counted on to serve the needs  of special investigators. In it, however, were some choice, basically important and valuable items. The first American commissioner to China, Caleb  Gushing, had personally collected Chinese books, and had given them to  the Library in the late 1840s. A classical Chinese herbal, edition of 1655,  was presented by the Emperor T'ung Chih in 1869. In 1898 the famous  Chinese Ambassador Wu Ting-Fang inspected the collection, and through  his courtesy arranged for it to be "catalogued by some learned gentlemen  connected with the embassy." At that time, the collection contained 2,888  volumes.  In 1904, the Chinese Government had exhibited 1,965 volumes at the  Louisiana Purchase Exposition; in 1905 it presented them to the United  States. The learned William Woodville Rockhill, Orientalist and special  American Minister to China, personally purchased and presented an  aggregate of 6,000 volumes. There followed, in 1908, the gift of a  sumptuous set of the Imperial Encyclopedia, in 5,041 volumes, brought to  Washington by a special ambassador and presented on behalf of the  Empress Dowager to the American government as a memorial tribute of  China's appreciation of the remission by the United States of the last of  22  PB# 	asu06600000300024001							67075252 Bytes	3926	5693	3314587337	RGB	8	600	asu06600000300024001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/984	984	985.jp2	/asu0660/image/985.jp2

With these gifts, the collection numbered 15,894 volumes, and  was on the way toward becoming one of the important Oriental libraries  in the West. This was where things stood in 1911 when Swingle began  using the collection.  The Chinese botanical and agricultural literature held records of  economic plants going back many hundreds of years, but the old volumes  accessible to Swingle referred to still older works. When he would ask to  consult these, he found that most were not in the collection. Many were  known to have survived in China or Japan, or might turn up if searched  for. The Library kept adding these titles to its list of desiderata, but had  no operating plan for developing its Orientalia. By his intensive use of the  materials and his requests for titles not held by the Library, Swingle was,  de facto, guiding its development.  In 1915 Swingle was preparing for his first trip to China. Foreigners  now had access to some official Chinese libraries. Swingle needed to  consult these older references, and queried Herbert Putnam, the learned  and far-seeing Librarian of Congress, as to where he might find them.  Putnam was interested in systematically rounding out the Library's  holdings so that it would serve scholars adequately, and here was Swingle  with a long list of herbals and encyclopedias not in the collection. Would  Mr. Swingle be willing to accept a commission authorizing him to buy  important books that would supply these deficiencies? Mr. Swingle was  mightily pleased at such a prospect. Together the two men worked out the  broad outlines of a program, and Swingle undertook his commission with  typical enthusiasm.  From this point until 1928 the growth and development of the  Division of Orientalia, Library of Congress, was systematically guided by  Swingle, and his interest continued for the rest of his life. The ability to  transmit his enthusiasm to others enabled him to obtain efficient  collaboration in the task, not only from friends in the Bureau of Plant  Industry, but from persons he knew only through correspondence. From  1916 to 1928 he wrote the Annual Reports on Far Eastern accessions for  the Librarian. He continued to contribute to the reports for the botanical,  agricultural, and geographical accessions until 1935. His reports were brief  but highly effective, and actually constitute a history of Chinese science.  In them, he enumerated the most significant Chinese, Korean, Japanese,  Mongol, Manchu and Annamite accessions, adding inspiringly enthusiastic  annotations. They gave our American botanists and agriculturists an  inkling of what they might find in the ancient herbals, encyclopedias, and  gazetteers, of Chinese economic botany and ethnobotany. Others reading  these reports caught his enthusiasm and offered to collaborate.  From the herbals and encyclopedic agricultural works, Swingle turned  his attention to the gazetteers that the Chinese periodically compiled for  the country as a whole, and for provincial and lesser subdivisions. These  gazetteers include not only geographic descriptions, but annals of each  23 	asu06600000300025001							66555344 Bytes	3886	5707	579542656	RGB	8	600	asu06600000300025001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/985	985	986.jp2	/asu0660/image/986.jp2

When Swingle's good friend O.F. Cook travelled widely  in China in 1919 to investigate the cultivation of cotton, Swingle asked  him to buy any gazetteers he came across to help build up the already  notable collection in the Library. With the help of his assistant, Mr. Yen  Yuen-Ting, Cook secured no less than 108 official gazetteers in 1,239  volumes. As a result, Swingle was able to report with pride in 1920 that  "the Library of Congress now contains the largest collection of official  gazetteers to be found outside of China." In the same year, a professional  copyist began copying valuable selected manuscripts in the great library  of Canton. And Berthold Laufer, the great Orientalist of the Field  Museum of Chicago, cooperated in the acquisition of Mongol books.  Swingle also sought out Chinese "ts'ung shu," or collectanea. These  consist of sets in which are reprinted rare books long out of print and  unavailable as separate volumes. Individual "ts'ung shu" usually cover a  special field of endeavor, and are ambitious undertakings. The bulkiest of  them all, the Yung Lo Ta Tien, had the objective of including all "serious  works" of Chinese literature extant in the year 1400, excluding novels and  plays. It comprised 11,095 volumes, and was never printed. It existed at  first only in the original draft and one final copy. Later a new copy was  made. Swingle stated that "some 8,000 years' labor of scholars was spent  in compiling, copying, and proofreading the original work, and that another  2,000 years' labor went into the copies and transcripts. So far as is known,  only scattered volumes of this monumental "ts'ung shu" have survived,  of which the Library of Congress has 33; only the Library of the Chinese  Ministry of Education has more, holding 60." (Annual Report, 1922).  There is a historical study of the Yung Lo Ta Tien by the Chinese  scholar, Sun Chuang, in the Library of Congress. A dedicatory foreword in  this book says that "during a visit to Peking, Shih Yung-kao (no other  than Walter T. Swingle) had recognized the value of the work and had  urged that a copy be made for the Library of Congress." The obliging  author complied, and sent it with the annotation that "the task had been  completed on the 20th day of the 10th month of the 7th year of the  Chinese Republic" (October 20, 1918). It had been requested when  Swingle first visited China in 1915. The Library of Congress holds the  largest collection of "ts'ung shu" outside of China and Japan.  In 1926 Swingle was a member of the official American delegation to  the Pan Pacific Science Congress held at Tokyo, and was able to visit  China and Korea as well as Japan. It was a banner year for the acquisition  of Oriental books. By 1928 the collection had reached a size where it  became the Division of Orientalia, and required a fulltime chief; Dr.  Arthur W. Hummel was appointed to the position. Librarian Putnam  expressed unstinting appreciation of Swingle's work in his Annual Report  for 1928: "From 1910 the collection has been developed systematically,  24 	asu06600000300026001							67628400 Bytes	3957	5695	1134506193	RGB	8	600	asu06600000300026001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/986	986	987.jp2	/asu0660/image/987.jp2

Swingle, in whose constant  interest its present eminence is due. It now numbers over 100,000 Chinese  volumes, unsurpassed outside of China and Japan."  At the same time work on citrus and the date had continued. Swingle's  ideas were still generating controversy. He stirred up a hornet's nest at the  Pan Pacific Science Congress at Tokyo, and at the International Congress  of Plant Sciences at Ithaca, N.Y., in 1926, when he read a paper describing his findings about pollination in dates. Unable to resist making some  date hybrids, he had used pollen from other species of the genus Phoenix  to pollinate the female flowers of specific varieties of the commercial date,  Phoenix dactylifera. These were controlled pollinations, carefully made and  observed. To his enormous surprise, the fruits containing the developing  hybrid seed differed markedly in size, texture, quality, sweetness, time of  ripening, and in other ways from the normal fruits of these date varieties.  This was an unheard-of, unreported effect in any plant; the developing  hybrid seeds in some way modified the tissues of the fruit of the female  parent. The effect differed from cross to cross, according to the species  used as the pollen source. Swingle proposed the term "metaxenia" for this  effect.  Both meetings erupted in violent controversy after Swingle presented  his paper. Most geneticists and physiologists held that his observations had  been wrong, that a hybrid seed had no effect on the fruit in which it  developed, that his findings were imaginary and nonsensical. What especially galled him was that although he had been studying genetics and  plant breeding for over forty years, although he had made and described  thousands of hybrids and had even been instrumental in developing the  ultraviolet microscope and ultraviolet photography as a cytological tool,  yet some of his critics refused to discuss his findings, and were dismissing  him as a scientific moss-back who might not have understood elementary  genetics, whose conclusions need not be taken seriously. But Swingle was  confident of the accuracy of his observations; he had seen those dates, his  critics had not. He published on the subject again in 1928, suggesting that  the effect might be caused by a hormone from the embryo or endosperm  acting on the developing fruit, but plant hormones were not yet being  talked about, and the old theory of "formative staffs" was seldom mentioned. Swingle continued to study metaxenia in the date, published  further descriptions of its effects in 1930, and in 1931 read additional  papers before the Physiological Section of the Botanical Society of America  and the National Academy of Sciences. By then his evidence was overwhelming; even the diehards were beginning to think there might be something in it. In 1932 he was able to publish an account in the semi-monthly  news letter of the Division of Horticultural Crops and Diseases, entitled  "Metaxenia at the first denied then accepted by many leading physiologists  and scientists." (Metaxenia and its effects are now recognized as occurring  in many kinds of fruits, and the effect has considerable horticultural significance. )  The work with citrus and its hybrids, begun in 1908, was turning up  25 	asu06600000300027001							66263128 Bytes	3888	5679	3845030632	RGB	8	600	asu06600000300027001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/987	987	988.jp2	/asu0660/image/988.jp2

(Frank Denmire), 1920-																											asu0660000030	new information of genetic and physiological significance, and of horticultural importance. Swingle was a keen observer, with the ability to note  a commonplace event that everyone else overlooked, and by comparative  observations then draw a conclusion. He was well versed in the experimental method, but his experience had taught him that it was not the "be  all and end all" of scientific investigation. From his observations, he  formulated three new theses.  There were many geneticists and physiologists in the audience who had  "eaten crow" in the metaxenia debates, when Swingle read three papers  before the VI International Congress of Genetics at Ithaca, N.Y., in 1932.  He was confident of their attention, and sure he would be under fire again.  He therefore sought to forestall this by bringing with him an elaborate  exhibit of living citrus hybrids, seedlings, fruits, and varieties to illustrate  his papers.  His first paper presented the theory of neophyosis: the rejuvenescence  or loss of senility in nucellar bud seedlings of citrus. It had long been  thought that when some varieties of flowers or fruits were propagated by  cuttings, budding, or grafting over a number of years, the variety petered  out — it became senescent or "senile" — and no longer had the vigor or  the same characteristics it had had originally, and would finally have to be  discarded. This was also true of cultivated citrus varieties. But in the seeds  of a few plants, including most citrus, there is more than one embryo. One  of these is the "true" or gametic embryo; the others develop from the tissue  surrounding the nucellus, and are genetically identical to the mother plant.  Swingle had found that when seedlings grew from these nucellar embryos  in a variety that was senescent or petering out, the nucellar seedlings reproduced the variety as it was originally; the variety was rejuvenated. He called  this effect "neophyosis." It had profound horticultural implications for the  citrus industry, and it raised a lot of physiological and genetic questions as  well. But many members of his audience were out of their depth with this  paper. Even today, nucellar embryony is unknown to many geneticists  unless they happen to be working with the relatively few plants in which  it occurs. Many plant physiologists are unaware of the phenomenon. The  paper generated a lot of questions, most of which asked for amplification.  The exhibit of plants received gratifying attention.  Swingle's second paper also dealt with nucellar seedlings. He reported  that no matter how many diseases, including viruses, attacked or lived in  the mother tree, its nucellar seedlings were disease-free. Some mechanism  in the nucellus was destroying or screening them out. He had found also  that a diseased hybrid could be indefinitely reproduced disease-free by use  of its nucellar seedlings. These findings, when taken with those in the first  paper, implied that ageing or senescence might be caused by a gradual  accumulation of diseases or viruses, or caused by them in part. Again, there  were enormous genetic, physiological, and horticultural implications. Again,  he had put together a good exhibit of living plants illustrating these findings. There were highly controversial ideas in these papers, but, unlike their  reaction to his theory of metaxenia, his fellow scientists found that it was  26 	asu06600000300028001							66735952 Bytes	3931	5657	612199739	RGB	8	600	asu06600000300028001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/988	988	989.jp2	/asu0660/image/989.jp2

(Frank Denmire), 1920-																											asu0660000030	not so easy to ignore him this time, or to dismiss all those plants he had  brought along.  Swingle's third paper claimed that some of the seedlings obtained from  bigeneric crosses exhibited remote ancestral characteristics, features outside  the range of characteristics shown by the parent lines. Now this was against  all the rules — it was as if he had claimed to have mated an alligator with  a crocodile, and some of the eggs hatched into dinosaurs. Again, he had  brought along an exhibit of parents and progeny, and it was impossible to  deny that the offspring showed characters outside the range of those  exhibited by either parent. But there was considerable debate as to whether  these were "remote ancestral characteristics."  Today, 45 years later, nucellar seedlings of citrus are recognized as  vigorous, with juvenile characters, relatively free of diseases. They are  widely used both as rootstocks and for scion sources in the United States.  And it is agreed that some bigeneric citrus hybrids exhibit characters  beyond the range of those manifest by either parent, although their appearance is as yet not adequately explained.  Meanwhile, Swingle continued to publish descriptions of the new  hybrid fruits obtained from the citrus breeding program. He had been able  to introduce more of the wild relatives, and include these. As a result,  horticulturists, nurserymen, and growers confronted an increasingly bewildering array of new fruits: Cicitranges, Citradias, Citrandarins, Citranges,  Citrangedins, Citrangequats, Citrangeremos, Citrangors, Citremons, Cit-  rumelos, Citrumquats, Eremolemons, Eremoradias, Eremoranges, Faustri-  medins, Ichandarins, Lemandarins, Lemonanges, Lemonimes, Limequats,  Oramons, Orangequats, Orangelos, Procimequats, Segetranges, Tangelos,  Tangemons, Tangors. Citrus hybridization had been begun at the Federal  Citrus Experiment Station at Riverside, California, in 1914-1916 by Dr.  Howard B. Frost. This work dealt largely with crosses of varieties and  species within the genus Citrus itself. In Florida, the State Citrus Experiment Station at Lake Alfred began a hybridization program in 1924, aiming  at producing new acid citrus fruits better adapted to Florida conditions.  Work began in other countries (Java, the Philippines, the U.S.S.R.) during  1927 or later.  But Swingle's program was far more extensive in scope; it was still  organized as a "linear" program, without specific short-term goals. He  came under increasing criticism from all directions. The growers did not  want to bother with more than two or three standard varieties, and were  becoming increasingly fearful of the economic implications of these new  fruits; they didn't want their groves devalued. Swingle felt that botanical  interest alone justified making these new hybrids, and that they should be  held in reserve. He maintained that the growers should be educated up to  the point of insuring their own interests, no matter how resistant they were  to the idea. He advocated that all known citrus allies should be collected,  grown, and tested for resistance or immunity to the prevailing diseases of  all citrus-growing areas of the world. This was to be followed by production  in each country of new disease-resistant varieties which were to be intro-  27 	asu06600000300029001							66848964 Bytes	3897	5716	828387579	RGB	8	600	asu06600000300029001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/989	989	990.jp2	/asu0660/image/990.jp2

(Frank Denmire), 1920-																											asu0660000030	duced to commercial production if possible, but in any case to be held in  reserve for emergencies. He was determined to have a disease-free citrus  experiment station on an island of the Inland Sea of Japan, and others  elsewhere. The Department was staggered by the scope of these proposals;  it was said in Washington that "If we don't clamp down on his budget.  Swingle will breed more projects in half a day than 100 men could keep  going in a lifetime." True. But those who kept him in check are unknown  and unacclaimed today.  By early 1933, at the age of 62, Swingle was at the apogee of his career  in the Department of Agriculture. He was a valued member of many  national and European professional societies, belonged to the Cosmos  Club, had received an honorary Doctorate of Science from Kansas State.  As Chief of the Office of Crop Physiology and Breeding Investigations, he  had instituted programs and projects across the entire southern part of the  country, and was outlining new programs in broad, bold brushstrokes. In  addition, he had authored 230 publications. His tenacity of purpose and  intense interest in the work of his Office, however, kept him from seeing  it in perspective to the agricultural development and needs of the country  as a whole.  In the first two decades of this century, the frontier disappeared and  settlements increased; more and more land was used for agriculture. The  growth of large cities created bigger markets, and the importance of farming as a business increased. With the development of motorized farm  machinery, still larger areas were brought under cultivation. By 1930 the  staple crops were overproduced, glutting the market; their price fell below  production cost. The stock-market crash of 1929 and the deepening  economic depression that followed had plunged the nation into suffering  and distress. Most of the country's farmers confronted disaster, and were  in despair.  Franklin D. Roosevelt came to the White House on March 4, 1933, at  the height of the crisis, when the financial structure of the country seemed  to be tottering. He quickly set up agencies to reorganize industry and agriculture under Federal controls. Henry A. Wallace was appointed Secretary  of Agriculture and the Agricultural Adjustment Administration was set up  within the Department under his supervision. This agency was given precedence to cope with the emergency in the agricultural sector of the economy.  The basic policy adopted was to help farmers by cutting supplies of staple  crops, thus raising prices through the law of supply and demand. A further  goal was to change the agricultural pattern from overproduction of staple  crops to more diversified farming. All the old-line bureaus concerned with  production were ordered on standby. Instructions were to hold the status  quo, undertake no new programs or projects, wait for further orders.  The new agency had action programs under way by late 1933, and  Wallace turned his attention to the Department. A high-level review concluded that it had "just grown up like Topsy"; that its policies, programs,  projects,  and  objectives  were often  uncoordinated,   that  far  too  much  28 	asu06600000300030001							67137096 Bytes	3920	5707	343120172	RGB	8	600	asu06600000300030001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/990	990	991.jp2	/asu0660/image/991.jp2
Walter Tennyson Swingle, 1871-1952					Venning, Frank D. (Frank Denmire), 1920-																											asu0660000030	emphasis had been given to production, far too little or none to economic  consequences, marketing, credit, new uses for farm products, soil conservation, the well-being of farm families. A shift of emphasis was needed,  together with an efficient dynamic research program, to render the Department capable of guiding all aspects of agricultural development in a logical,  coordinated way. A sweeping reorganization was ordered in 1934; Swingle  fared far worse in the outcome than he would ever have believed possible.  When the New Deal "brain-trust," involved as it was with the immediacy  of a vast nation-wide agricultural disaster, reviewed his work, to their eyes  much of it seemed irrelevant, of no practical consequence, extravagant,  futile. They took a ruthless position; his past record of accomplishment  meant nothing. The Office of Crop Physiology and Breeding Investigations  was summarily abolished. Swingle retained the title of Principal Physiologist, but was without staff, budget, or travel allowances. He had no control  over any of the programs or projects he had started. In effect, he was  another employee, without authority, to receive work assignments at the  discretion of an unsympathetic superior. It was an exceedingly bitter pill,  and it stuck in his throat for the rest of his life. His contemporary colleagues, appalled at the treatment he received, were sympathetic, but their  heads were rolling, too. Their opinions carried no weight with the new  powers.  Many another man would have resigned under these conditions, not  Walter T. Swingle. Three traits in his character were misread by his new  superiors. He had a deep and abiding interest in his work for its own sake,  he had a tenacity of purpose that would shame a Missouri mule, and he  was an optimist — he felt certain that the new administration would  eventually come to its senses and reinstate him to his former position, or  that the electorate would come to theirs and vote the rascals out. His  optimism was ill-founded, the result of a curious blindness to the new  realities, but he never lost it. Meanwhile, he was especially irritated to find  that he was being shunted aside, was not receiving assignments, not being  consulted, his advice and opinions largely ignored. He continued work on  the citrus monograph, kept looking over his superior's shoulder as action  was taken in the projects he had controlled and carefully pointed out the  errors being made. At 65 years of age, in 1936, he chose not to retire, and  the department could hardly refuse him this. He continued to publish on  metaxenia, neophyosis, and the remote ancestral characters being exhibited  by new citrus hybrids. He was not allowed to continue work in Florida on  his remaining hybrids, however. In 1939, the Department decided to consolidate all Federal citrus work in Florida at Orlando. In June of that year,  over his violent protests, an official ordered all of his hybrids dug up,  hauled to Orlando, set out in the field under the broiling summer sun with  no provision to water them. It didn't rain for the next three weeks and  they died by the hundreds. Most of this collection, representing years of  labor, was lost. It broke his heart.  Despite these latter years when his authority was in eclipse, Swingle's  professional reputation as a scientist and agriculturist continued to gain in  29 	asu06600000300031001							68047896 Bytes	3923	5780	264498935	RGB	8	600	asu06600000300031001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/991	991	992.jp2	/asu0660/image/992.jp2

After  retirement in January 1941, he remained as a Collaborator of the Department, as well as becoming Consultant for Tropical Botany at the University  of Miami. He continued to be as prolific of ideas as ever. When Dr. Ashe  formed the Post-War Planning Commission at the University in 1944, to  supply background studies for the economic and sociological planning of  the Greater Miami area and its integration and coordination into South  Florida, he invited Swingle to participate in one of the early meetings  which was concerned with an evaluation of natural resources. The meeting  lasted the better part of a morning. Afterward, one senior scientist remarked, "I've never heard anyone come up with so many ideas on the spur  of the moment in my life! Some of them were way out, but he gave us a  lot to choose from!" A younger man came by and said, "I've decided that  the way to succeed in this world is to have a lot of ideas! I don't think it  much matters what they are, just so you have a lot of ideas. I'm going to  be an idea man from now on!" Still later, a senior economist came by.  "Swingle stole the show this morning," he said, "and in all that thicket of  ideas, I think his main points were right. He talked about the horrible  things that were happening in Los Angeles because of poor planning. He  told us that the same things can happen here unless we make sure of our  water supply from Lake Okeechobee, stop filling in the mangroves and  building on the beaches, keep some green space, do something to make it  easy for people to get to work without having to use an automobile."  When Swingle came back from the meeting he said, "Dr. Ashe asked me  to write down some of the things I said in that meeting. You should have  heard the fuss when I told them that Miami had to fill in some of those  canals and stop draining the Everglades or they'll be pumping sea water  out of their wells. The trouble is, none of those men have been here long  enough to know what the place was like; they can't see what's been happening to it!"  Swingle lived to see the American date industry well established. He  was pleased to note that in the year 1945 alone, the income taxes paid by  date growers to the Federal Treasury totalled a greater sum than all of the  research and development costs expended on it by the Federal Government  from its beginning in 1898 through 1945!  Undiminished activity and publication continued through the end of  1947, an eventful year for Swingle. He remained nimble-witted and spry,  quick to take action. On February 16th, he wrote Fairchild:  Dear David,  I had quite an experience about 7:45 Friday night when the Orange Blossom Seaboard train lost two cars, ran off the tracks going at high speed and tore up the ties  for nearly a quarter of a mile.  I was suddenly thrown on the floor of the club car, from a seat running from the  window to the aisle. &gt;  In about one-half second I saw the window heave up several feet and was thrown  into the aisle and several people fell on me, holding me down so firmly I could not  move my legs!  30 	asu06600000300032001							67337288 Bytes	3920	5724	3247358506	RGB	8	600	asu06600000300032001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/992	992	993.jp2	/asu0660/image/993.jp2

Half a dozen or more ambulances rushed  down from Jacksonville (22 miles away) and took about 30 wounded to the hospital.  I have a bruise, but not serious; but lost my glasses in the fall. By 11:15 we were  picked up by the main part of our train and reached Jacksonville at midnight. Left at  2 A.M. and reached Washington at 7:15 P.M. Saturday.  No luck — I did not see my whole life unroll when I fell.  As ever,  Tenny  When on campus, Swingle took on an aura of boyishness, undergoing  a kind of "neophyosis." The Frank N. Meyer medal was awarded him that  summer in recognition of his outstanding service in plant introduction  work. The ceremonies were held at the U.S. Plant Introduction Garden at  Chapman Field, Miami. He and a former colleague were being so honored.  When his colleague stood before the assembly, Swingle turned in shocked  surprise and said, "Why, Harry's an old man! Do I look as old as that  to you?"  That fall, the government of France was celebrating the Golden Jubilee  in the career of their most illustrious botanist, Professor Auguste Chevalier,  an old friend in whose honor Swingle had named a new species of Aeglopsis,  back in 1912. The French Government invited Swingle to attend the  festivities, and the University sponsored his trip to Paris. (Swingle had long  been a member of the Societe d'Acclimatation de France, a corresponding  member of the Academie d'Agriculture de France, and a collaborator with  L'Institut des Fruits et Agrumes Coloniaux in researches to improve the  culture of tropical and Mediterranean fruits.) He was warmly received,  and the Cercle de la France d'Outre-Mer held a special reception in his  honor, during which he warned of the ravages to citrus in California by the  "Quick Decline" virus, and of its similarity to the "tristeza" virus of  Brazil. He had a grand time, staying for some weeks at the urging of Prof.  Chevalier, and working over the new specimens of citrus relatives in the  herbarium of the Museum.  He returned home to learn that the Library of Congress had named him  an honorary consultant for development of the Division of Orientalia, in  recognition of his labors in building up their collection of oriental books.  By the end of 1947, he had authored throughout his career, over 256  separate publications. It was his last full year of unstinting activity. His  final trip to Miami was in 1950, when, accompanied by Mrs. Swingle, he  was honored by the Fairchild Tropical Garden and was awarded the  Thomas Barbour medal. Twenty-five years have passed since his death on  January 19, 1952. He is remembered by the world at large for his contributions to science and to oriental literature, but to those who knew him and  worked with him he remains "ein grosser Geist" — greater than a scholar,  more human than a genius.  31 	asu06600000300033001							68108372 Bytes	3942	5757	1747533333	RGB	8	600	asu06600000300033001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/993	993	994.jp2	/asu0660/image/994.jp2

Spanish and Spanish American Books in the University of Miami Library					Owre, J. Riis																											asu0660000025	THE  CARRELL  Volume 13  December 1972  Number 2  Spanish and Spanish American Books  in the University of Miami Library  By J. Rus Owre  When I look back upon an association of over thirty-  seven years with the University of Miami, it is the  Library, more than anything else, that gives me a  feeling of nostalgia. I've spent a lot of time in it and on it.  My first visit to the Library, on a sultry day in September,  1935, was an experience I shall not forget. The whole Library  was housed in a cramped, dingy space on the second floor of  the old Anastasia Building; a few tables and chairs, some rickety  home-made wooden shelves. For the spring quarter—the University was on the quarter system then—I was scheduled to teach  two courses in literature, one of peninsular Spain and one of  Hispanic America. I had come to investigate the library resources  for these two courses. There were no resources. None at all. On  a dusty, termite-ridden shelf stood one slim volume, a text-book  edition of ten chapters of El Quijote, edited by J. D. M. Ford  in 1908. There were also an uncatalogued paper-back novel by  Concha Espina, a dictionary, a couple of histories of literature,  and a manual of constitutional law by Juan Clemente Zamora.  This is my "one book on the shelf" story as I have told it often  since. It is substantially, but not entirely, correct, as I shall show.  I left the Library in a daze. A hundred feet down the hall  was the president's office. I burst in, unannounced. (In those  days, the University was small, and Dr. Ashe could leave his 	asu06600000250003001							67921608 Bytes	3911	5787	1980206663	RGB	8	600	asu06600000250003001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1000	1000	1001.jp2	/asu0660/image/1001.jp2

When I had explained the situation—with a youthful desperation  I remember even now — Dr. Ashe answered philosophically,  "Well, we'll have to get some books. How much do you need?"  I gasped. I had no idea. Nothing in my graduate training had  prepared me for this kind of situation. "Any amount, any  amount," I said. The President wrote something on a 3 x 5 card  and handed it to me. I read: "U. J. [U. J. Hiss, the Assistant  Treasurer]—make $500 available to Owre to buy some Spanish  books. B. F. A." And that was the start of the Hispanic collections we have today. Now, the sum seems paltry; in 1935 it  looked large indeed at the University of Miami.  Now, after examining the old accession records of the Library,  I know that there were—or should have been—a few other  Spanish books on the shelves that day. I did not see them; I do  not know why. Perhaps they had already been lost. It is not  likely that they were in circulation, for classes had not started  yet.1  Remarkably, in an institution whose first catalogue had proudly announced it as "a Pan American University" with a "unique  and far-reaching feature ... the Pan American section,"2 only  twelve books in Spanish were accessioned in the first year (6  January 1927 through 28 December), out of a total of exactly  1800. And, among the first 5000 volumes accessioned through  25 March 1930, the Hispanic field shows but 85 titles—only a  little better than German (79) and not nearly so well as French  (149).3  The records show that almost all the books acquired were  gifts. The University had opened with an enormous deficit, and  there was almost no money for books; so the faculty contributed  what they could, and helped to start the library. On the pages  of those early accession books appear many names of the members of the first faculty—Angel del Rio, Juan Clemente Zamora,  Cyrus Wicker, and many more. Henry S. West, a classical scholar  who was the first dean of the College of Liberal Arts, as it was  called then, and also of the School of Education—a double  "first"!—perhaps had studied Spanish, for among the hundreds  of books he presented were a few Spanish texts. 	asu06600000250004001							67498920 Bytes	3888	5785	2062411828	RGB	8	600	asu06600000250004001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1001	1001	1002.jp2	/asu0660/image/1002.jp2
Spanish and Spanish American Books in the University of Miami Library					Owre, J. Riis																											asu0660000025	Apparently the first book actually purchased for the Hispanic  section—after the dictionary—was Hurtado's new Eistoria de la  literatura espanola (Madrid, 1925), which is #2951 in the accession book (7 December 1928). Until the $500 which Dr.  Ashe made available, there appears to have been no systematic  attempt to build up the library in the Hispanic area, or in any  area. There was no budget for books. Only one purchase of any  importance is recorded—that of a small private library belonging to the French Hispanist Marios Andre (1868-1928). On  7 September 1928, Victor Andres Belaunde, a member of the  first faculty, had written to Dr. Ashe:  We have a good opportunity of acquiring a good base for the  special library of our Latin American department. Mrs. Andre,  the widow of the well-known Americanist, is disposed to sell us  a very valuable collection of 300 volumes for $120. The transportation from Paris will not amount to more than $30. Many  of these books are out of print. If you approve of this adquisi-  tion [sic] I will write to Mrs. Andre immediately.4  No answer to the letter has been found, but the purchase was  evidently made; these must be the books accessioned as #3153-  3310 in May 1929, identified as "Belaunde books from Paris."  The little library provided some support for the various courses  Dr. Belaunde taught in Latin American civilization, but little  for literature.  One feels for the Library staff of those days—until one realizes  that there was no staff. It was not until 1 November 1932 that  an appointment (part-time) of a librarian was made: Mrs. Dorothy V. Miller, the wife of E. Morton Miller, of the department  of zoology. A full-time librarian, Marian Youngs, was appointed  for the academic year 1933-34, but she resigned at the end of  the year. Mrs. Miller replaced her and was the librarian for several years thereafter. When I met her in 1935 she had no one  to help her except a few students. She herself did all the business  of the library—ordering, accessioning, cataloguing, circulating,  reference. It was a job that demanded professional heroism.  In 1932-34 came the famous bankruptcy of the University.  It put an end to purchases; but it also got the institution out  of the red, and in 1935 things improved. New acquisitions reached a total of 2,576.

The books I ordered with Dr. Ashe's appropriation began to  arrive late in October of 1935. A few of the first titles ordered  will indicate that before that time the collection did not really  exist: El Quijote, El burlador de Sevilla, Don Juan Tenorio, El  Cantar de Mio Cid, La Celestina, El libro de buen amor, Laz~  arillo. How could Spanish literature have been taught for almost  eight years, at a time when anthologies were almost non-existent,  without these books on the shelves? Here we have perhaps an  explanation for the remarkable beginning of the description of  course Spanish 401 (Spanish literature) in the General Announcement for 1935-1936: "Regular and figurative syntax,  general ideas of Spanish literature and rhetoric, outlines of the  modern Spanish literature."5 That description was changed the  next year!  One frustration followed another. In 1936, the outbreak of  the Civil War in Spain ruined the peninsular book trade, and it  became necessary to buy from dealers in Hispanic America,  which was then not nearly so active in publishing as it is now.  Two years later, when Robert E. McNicoll and I founded the  Hispanic-American Institute (historically the ancestor of the  present Center for Advanced International Studies), we were  able to begin the use of exchange to build up the Library. One  of the activities of the Institute was a publication, the University  of Miami Hispanic-American Studies.6  We sent copies of the first number all over the Hispanic world,  with a letter requesting exchange of publications, and thus initiated an exchange program which still continues. It brought  to the Library hundreds of books and periodicals in many fields  —just how many cannot be ascertained now, for the early files  of the Institute have disappeared. I do remember that ministries  of education and other cultural entities responded with a generosity that surprised us. From one alone, the Portuguese Instituto  Alto do Livro, we received over one hundred volumes. When  I returned to the campus after World War II, I was delighted  to find several large boxes of books waiting to be acknowledged. 	asu06600000250006001							68690148 Bytes	3964	5774	2733178620	RGB	8	600	asu06600000250006001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1003	1003	1004.jp2	/asu0660/image/1004.jp2
Spanish and Spanish American Books in the University of Miami Library					Owre, J. Riis																											asu0660000025	The exchange program had had enough momentum to carry it  on in spite of the war.  It was in 1938 that the University received its first really significant gift of Spanish books, the private library of the late  John Barrett, first Director General of the Pan American Union.  The collection was not large, but the recognition of the institution  implied in this kind of legacy was heartening.  During the period 1939-1942 there were contributions from  another source: the Spanish poet Juan Ramon Jimenez and his  wife Zenobia. The couple lived in Coral Gables during those  years. Twice Juan Ramon taught a course in Spanish poetry at  the University, and six times he lectured at the Hispanic-American Institute.7  For this he never would accept any compensation. Knowing  that the two were living on a very modest income, I finally forced  cheques upon them. And every penny of that money was spent  upon books—scores of books—which Zenobia bought for the  Library. Often I came upon her in the stacks, checking to make  sure she ordered no duplicates. The luxury of duplicates was  not to be afforded in those days.  No progress at all was made during World War II, except  for a few gifts; but thereafter, things exploded. Spanish received  a real 'push' on 28 December 1945, when the late Meyer Gold  made a gift of $1000 "for purchase of Spanish and Portuguese  books under the direction of Dr. Owre." Mr. Gold was a shrewd  business man, who understood men and institutions. The terms  of his gift stipulated that the usual Library budgets for these two  languages must not be reduced because of it.8  This was the first of a series of gifts extending over more than  a decade and amounting to a total of more than $15,000. The  generous support of Mr. and Mrs. Gold was a major factor in  the development of the Hispanic collections. As early as May  1947, almost 500 volumes had been purchased through the  "Gold Fund," and a year and a half later I was able to inform  the Golds that as a result of their generosity we would be able  to offer the Master of Arts degree in certain fields of Spanish.9  Another major factor in the growth of the Hispanic section, 	asu06600000250007001							67163112 Bytes	3876	5774	3011698203	RGB	8	600	asu06600000250007001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1004	1004	1005.jp2	/asu0660/image/1005.jp2

(He had been  with the University for eight months with the title of "Assistant  Documents and Periodicals Librarian.") His broad knowledge  of books and of book markets, his passion for building the Library, made many things possible.  It was William Harkins, the Librarian at that time, and Charles Morgan who located the unusual private library which was  our first large purchase from the "Gold Fund." There were over  900 Spanish books, and we obtained them for only $1,715. If  my memory serves (the record of the transaction is not complete), the books were in the possession of a Boston furniture  dealer, who had acquired them along with a houseful of antique  furniture. He was anxious to get rid of the books. He had a list  of them, but he was unwilling to open the boxes to make a  careful check. So—after looking at the list!—we bought the  books more or less on trust. Our confidence was not betrayed.  It was a rare piece of luck, the kind of thing that happens once  in a lifetime.  Well I remember opening those boxes! Out came the monumental works of Spain's first important bibliographer, Nicolas  Antonio—perfect copies of the second editions of the Bibliotheca  Hispana Vetus (Madrid, 1783) and the Bibliotheca Hispana  Nova (Madrid, 1788); and the scarce bibliographies of Salva,  Gallardo, Perez Pastor. There was an almost complete run of  the Revue Hispanique. There were fine complete sets of the kind  that almost never appear on the market, such as the Sociedad  de Bibliofilos Espanoles (31 vols.), the Coleccion de Libros  Espaholes Raws o curiosos (27 vols.), the Collecion de Escritores  Castellanos (141 vols.), the Libros de Antaho (15 vols,), and  the Bibliofilos Andaluces (31 vols.). There were works of scholars like Dozy, Cotarelo, Rodriguez Marin, and Amador de los  Rios; the fourth Boston edition of Ticknor; an early French  edition (Paris, 1812) of Bouterwek; and Viel-Castel's Essai sur  le theatre espagnol.  Finally, there were a few real treasures which we couM not  even today justify buying at current prices—but these came at 	asu06600000250008001							67815696 Bytes	3928	5753	1647116473	RGB	8	600	asu06600000250008001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1005	1005	1006.jp2	/asu0660/image/1006.jp2

Among them were the six folio  volumes of the first edition of the Spanish Academy dictionary,  the famous Diccionario de autoridades (Madrid, 1726-1739);  the 1674 edition of the Covarrubias Tesoro de la lengua caste-  liana o espanola; the Tomas Antonio Sanchez Coleccion de  poesias castellanas anteriores al siglo XV (4 vols., Madrid,  1779-1790); a first edition of a minor work of Lope de Vega  (lusta poetica, Madrid, 1620); and early editions of Gracian  (El criticon, Barcelona, 1664); Antonio de Solis (Historia de  la conquista de Mexico, Barcelona, 1691); and J. N. Bohl von  Faber (Floresta de rimas antiguas, Hamburg, 1821).  That was in 1948. In the same year, the University purchased  the library of Curtis Wilgus, consisting of between seven and  eight hundred volumes dealing with the history of Hispanic  America.  In 1960 came a splendid gift, the private library of the international lawyer, Phanor J. Eder. Mr. Eder's family and his own  personal interests were closely linked with Colombia, and his  library reflects this interest. The original gift consisted of about  1,500 carefully-chosen individual titles, plus many reviews and  pamphlets, primarily dealing with Colombia. Up to the time of  his death (5 March 1971), Mr. Eder continued to add to the  collection, and subsequently his son and daughter-in-law, Mr.  and Mrs. James Eder, have added over two hundred volumes.  This unusual and still-growing collection has made our library  important in Colombian studies.  Spanish and Spanish American literature have been my primary concern in this study, and I have gone a little off the track.  (Literature, history, "civilization" — how does one separate  these?) Let us get to a few statistics. From a mere handful —  literally—of books in 1935, the collections in Spanish (primarily  literature) have grown to about 12,000 in 1969, when an estimate was made for me. Now, in 1972, the figure must be considerably greater, although growth has been slower in recent  years.

Most of our books are useful; we have few collections of sermons. Still, there are surprising and distressing weaknesses.

Margaret Fuller: Commitment In Italy					Taylor, H. Leland																											asu0660000025	Margaret Fuller:  Commitment In Italy  By H. Leland Taylor  When Margaret Fuller left New York for Europe in  the summer of 1846, her credentials as a liberal were  already very good. She had been raised and educated  by her politician father, a Democrat under whose guidance she  read Thomas Jefferson at an early age: "I was charmed with  his mental activity, his philosophical spirit of enquiry, his freedom and firmness in thought or action. He has given me a higher  idea of what a genuine citizen of this republic may become. He  may become a genuine man.,n While living in Cambridge Fuller  had become the confidante of James Freeman Clarke and Frederic Henry Hedge (Harvard men), and had mastered enough  German to read the major works of Goethe (daring in that he  was censured because "full of fornification")—both the Class  of '29 and German literature were decidedly instrumental in  drawing Fuller out of New England Puritanism with that "wild  bugle-call" of rich romantic imagination. Between 1836 and  1839 Fuller made a substantial contribution to progressive education, first at Alcott's Temple School and then at Hiram Fuller's  Greene Street School—schools which aimed "to stimulate high  and free thought in place of mere memorizing, to nourish the  heart by cordial relations between teacher and pupil, and to  educate the senses by surroundings of art and beauty."2  Beginning in 1839 and continuing for five years Margaret  Fuller's Conversations in Boston provided a forum for feminism  and a concrete method (more congenial, she said, than teaching)  of upgrading women, of ascertaining "what pursuits are best  suited for us, in our time and state of society, and how we may  make the best use of our means for building up the life of thought  upon the life of action."3 She had already identified with the  Transcendentalists, attended meetings of the Club, and in 1840  was asked to edit the Dial, a journal which she hoped would  "afford an avenue for what of liberal and calm thought might  be originated among us."4 The Dial was, for the first two years, 	asu06600000250011001							67708476 Bytes	3892	5797	2593144764	RGB	8	600	asu06600000250011001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1008	1008	1009.jp2	/asu0660/image/1009.jp2

In 1843 Fuller journeyed west to Chicago and established  herself as a first-rate reporter and sympathetic observer of the  Indians in a book (Summer on the Lakes, 1844) which was reviewed on the front page of the New York Tribune and prompted Horace Greeley to offer her a job. In the fall of 1844 she  began her tenure as literary (and social) critic for the Tribune,  a period which Parrington calls "the beginning of her intellectual  maturity, the end of her mystical sentimentalism."6 That Greeley  thought she had "cast her lot at last with the left wing"7 may be  seen in his choice of Albert Brisbane, author of The Social Destiny of Man and exponent of Fourierism, as her predecessor, and  George Ripley as her successor. While in New York Fuller took  an aggressive interest in public institutions, particularly the  women's prison on BlackwelPs Island, the Bellevue Aims-House,  and the Bloomington Asylum. She wrote columns on prostitution, the blind, capital punishment, the right to vote, crime, and  the problems of immigrants. She made a personal appeal for  funds to establish an asylum for discharged woman convicts, a  rehabilitation center. She also championed the European struggles for freedom and on one occasion gave $500 to the Danish  refugee Harro-Harring to publish privately the chronicle of his  struggles in at least three different independence movements.  To her brother Richard she wrote: "A noble career opens before  me yet. I want my friends to wish me now to act in my public  capacity rather than towards them personally. Hitherto I have  given almost all my energy to personal relations. I no longer feel  inclined to do this. I wish to share and help impel the general  stream of thought."8  Yet on the eve of her departure for Europe, Margaret Fuller,  outspoken as she was on almost every important issue, had not  taken an active part in any partisan social or political movement.  She approved of Brook Farm, but refused to join; she opposed  slavery, but would not support the Abolitionists; she was a fem-  •  10 	asu06600000250012001							67974556 Bytes	3910	5793	2952707071	RGB	8	600	asu06600000250012001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1009	1009	1010.jp2	/asu0660/image/1010.jp2

She still believed that when the man changes, the  institution will change, that education produces morality which  is then rewarded with civil rights: "The sage of Monticello agrees  with Brougham and Goethe—Education first, political freedom  after."9 Fuller had embraced the objectives but not the methods;  she failed, in the words of Francis E. Kearns, "to resolve her  enthusiasm for social action with her distaste for organized reform  movements and to balance her proletarian sympathies with her  fears of Jacksonian democracy."10 On the eve of her departure  for Europe Margaret Fuller had already taken sides; it was in  Italy that she discovered just how far she was prepared to go.  A treatment of the entire European sojourn, including political and historical background, can be found in The Roman  Years of Margaret Fuller by Joseph J. Deiss. My objective is  to narrow the field: to document the growing radicalization of  Margaret Fuller and her total commitment at last to the Italian  Revolution. Thus the Italian story is not retold; rather Fuller's  growing political commitment is revealed in excerpts from her  dispatches to the Tribune and her letters to family and friends.  LONDON, December, 1846 [The Poor: In Shocking Contrast]  And though I wish to return to London in "the season," when  that city is an adequate representative of the state of things in  England, I am glad I did not at first see all that pomp and  parade of wealth and luxury in contrast with the misery, squalid,  agonizing, ruffianly, which stares one in the face in every street  of London, and hoots at the gates of her palaces more ominous  a note than ever was that of owl or raven in the portentous  times when empires and races have crumbled and fallen from  inward decay.  It is impossible, however, to take a near view of the treasures  created by English genius, accumulated by English industry,  without a prayer, daily more fervent, that the needful changes  in the condition of this people may be effected by peaceful revolution, which shall destroy nothing except the shocking inhumanity of exclusiveness, which now prevents their being used  for the benefit of all. May their present possessors look to it in  time! A few already are earnest in a good spirit.

Poverty in England has terrors of which I  never dreamed at home. I felt that it would be terrible to be poor  there, but far more so to be the possessor of that for which so  many thousands are perishing. And the middle class, too, cannot  here enjoy that serenity which the sages have described as naturally their peculiar blessing. Too close, too dark throng the evils  they cannot obviate, the sorrows they cannot relieve. To a man  of good heart, each day must bring purgatory which he knows  not how to bear, yet to which he fears to become insensible.  LONDON, December, 1846  [Joseph Mazzini: Exiled Italian Revolutionary]  The name of Joseph Mazzini is well known to those among us  who take an interest in the cause of human freedom, who, not  content with the peace and ease bought for themselves by the  devotion and sacrifices of their fathers, look with anxious interest on the suffering nations who are preparing for a similar  struggle. Those who are not, like the brutes that perish, content  with the enjoyment of mere national advantages, indifferent to  the idea they represent, cannot forget that the human family is  one,  "And beats with one great heart."  They know that there can be no genuine happiness, no salvation for any, unless the same can be secured for all. . . .  Mazzini, one of these noble refugees, is not only one of the  heroic, the courageous, and the faithful,—Italy boasts many  such,—but he is also one of the wise;—one of those who, disappointed in the outward results of their undertakings, can yet  "bate no jot of heart and hope," but must "steer right onward";  for it was no superficial enthusiasm, no impatient energies, that  impelled him, but an understanding of what must be the designs  of Heaven with regard to man, since God is Love, is Justice   Thus Mazzini, excluded from publication in his native language, has acquired the mastery both of French and English,  and through his expressions in either shine the thoughts which  animated his earlier effort with mild and steady radiance. The  misfortunes of his country have only widened the sphere of his  instructions, and made him an exponent of the better era to  Europe at large.  •   12 	asu06600000250014001							67873996 Bytes	3921	5768	2409922551	RGB	8	600	asu06600000250014001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1011	1011	1012.jp2	/asu0660/image/1012.jp2
Margaret Fuller: Commitment In Italy					Taylor, H. Leland																											asu0660000025	PARIS, February, 1847 [The Need for Radical Reform]  An immense crowd thronged the streets this year to see it [the  Procession of the Fat Ox], but few figures and little invention  followed the emblem of plenty; indeed, few among the people  could have had the heart for such a sham, knowing how the  poorer classes have suffered from hunger this winter. All signs  of this are kept out of sight in Paris. A pamphlet, called "The  Voice of Famine," stating facts, though in the tone of vulgar  and exaggerated declamation, unhappily common to productions on the radical side, was suppressed almost as soon as  published; but the fact cannot be suppressed, that the people  in the provinces have suffered most terribly amid the vaunted  prosperity of France.  While Louis Philippe lives, the gases, compressed by his strong  grasp, may not burst up to light; but the need of some radical  measures of reform is not less strongly felt in France than elsewhere, and the time will come before long when such will be  imperatively demanded. The doctrines of Fourier are making  considerable progress, and wherever they spread, the necessity  of some practical application of the precepts of Christ, in lieu  of the mummeries of a worn-out ritual, cannot fail to be felt.  The more I see of the terrible ills which infest the body politic  of Europe, the more indignation I feel at the selfishness or stupidity of those in my own country who oppose an examination  of these subjects,—such as is animated by the hope of prevention. The mind of Fourier was, in many respects, uncongenial  to mine. Educated in an age of gross materialism, he was tainted by its faults. In attempts to reorganize society, he commits  the error of making soul the result of health of body, instead  of body the clothing of soul; but his heart was that of a genuine  lover of his kind, of a philanthropist in the sense of Jesus,—his  views were large and noble. His life was one of devout study on  these subjects, and I should pity the person who, after the briefest sojourn in Manchester and Lyons,—the most superficial  acquaintance with the population of London and Paris,—could  seek to hinder a study of his thoughts, or be wanting in reverence for his purposes. But always, always, the unthinking mob  has found stones on the highway to throw at the prophets.  PARIS, February, 1847  [Adam Mickiewicz, Poet and Revolutionary]  [To R. W. Emerson:] Mickiewicz, the Polish poet, first introduced the Essays to acquaintances in Paris. I did not meet him  anywhere, and, as I heard a great deal of him which charmed  me, I sent him your poems, and he asked to come and see me.  He came, and I found in him the man I had long wished to see,  with the intellect and passions in due proportions for a full and  healthy human being, with a soul constantly inspiring.  13 	asu06600000250015001							67450476 Bytes	3896	5769	3471092319	RGB	8	600	asu06600000250015001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1012	1012	1013.jp2	/asu0660/image/1013.jp2

Votre esprit est lie a l'histoire de la Pologne, de la France et  commence a se Her a l'histoire de FAmerique. Vous appartenez  a la seconde generation des esprits. Votre mission est de con-  courir a la deliverance de la femme Polonaise, Francaise et  Americaine.12  SOUTHERN FRANCE, March, 1847  [Prostitution in England and France]  I have collected many facts with regards to this suffering class  of women, both in England and in France. I have seen them  under the thin veil of gayety, and in the horrible tatters of utter  degradation. I have seen the feelings of men with regard to their  condition, and the general heartlessness in women of more  favored and protected lives, which I can only ascribe to utter  ignorance of the facts.  ROME, May, 1847 [Italian Faith in the Pope]  He is a man of noble and good aspect, who, it is easy to see,  has set his heart upon doing something solid for the benefit of  man. But pensively, too, must one feel how hampered and inadequate are the means at his command to accomplish these  ends. The Italians do not feel it, but deliver themselves, with all  the vivacity of their temperament, to perpetual hurras, vivas,  rockets, and torchlight processions. I often think how grave and  sad must the Pope feel, as he sits alone and hears all this noise  of expectation.  ROME, May 7, 1848 [A Hierarchy of Values]  [To W. H. Channing:] I write not to you about these countries,  of the famous people I see, of magnificent shows and places.  All these things are only to me an illuminated margin on the  text of my inward life. Earlier, they would have been more.  Art is not important to me now. I like only what little I find  that is transcendantly good, and even with that feel very familiar  and calm. I take interest in the state of the people, their manners, the state of the race in them. I see the future dawning;  it is in important aspects Fourier's future. But I like no Four-  ierites; they are terribly wearisome here in Europe; the tide of  things does not wash through them as violently as with us, and  they have time to run in the tread-mill of system. Still, they  serve this great future which I shall not live to see. I must bb  born again.  •  14 	asu06600000250016001							68473932 Bytes	3934	5800	111351082	RGB	8	600	asu06600000250016001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1013	1013	1014.jp2	/asu0660/image/1014.jp2
Margaret Fuller: Commitment In Italy					Taylor, H. Leland																											asu0660000025	FLORENCE, summer, 1847 [Within, Tuscany Burns]  The Grand Duke—more and more agitated by the position in  which he finds himself between the influence of the Pope and  that of Austria—keeps imploring and commanding his people  to keep still, and they are still and glum as death. This is all on  the ouside; within, Tuscany burns. Private culture has not been  in vain, and there is, in a large circle, mental preparation for  a very different state of things from the present, with an ardent  desire to diffuse the same amid the people at large. The sovereign has been obliged for the present to give more liberty to  the press, and there is an immediate rush of thought to the new  vent; if it is kept open a few months, the effect on the body of  the people cannot fail to be great.  MILAN, August, 1847 [The Austrian Occupation]  Austria feels that there is now no sympathy for her in these  matters; that it is not the interest of the world to sustain her.  Her policy is, indeed, too thoroughly organized to change except by revolution; its scope is to serve, first, a reigning family  instead of the people; second, with the people to seek a physical  in preference to an intellectual good; and, third, to prefer a  seeming outward peace to an inward life. This policy may  change its opposition from the tyrannical to the insidious; it  can know no other change.  ROME, October 18, 1847 [Gorgeous Mummery]  It is never easy to put new wine into old bottles, and our age  is one where all things tend to a great crisis; not merely to revolution, but to radical reform. From the people themselves  the help must come, and not from princes; in the new state of  things, there will be none but natural princes, great men. From  the aspirations of the general heart, from the teachings of conscience in individuals, and not from an old ivy-covered church  long since undermined, corroded by time and gnawed by  vermin, the help must come. Rome, to resume her glory, must  cease to be an ecclesiastical capital; must renounce all this gorgeous mummery, whose poetry, whose picture, charms no one  more than myself, but whose meaning is all of the past, and  finds no echo in the future.  ROME, October 18, 1847 [The American Mode of Reasoning]  In reference to what I have said of many Americans in Italy, I  will only add, that they talk about the corrupt and degenerate  state of Italy as they do about that of our slaves at home. They  come ready trained to that mode of reasoning which affirms  that, because men are degraded by bad institutions, they are  not fit for better. . . .  15  • 	asu06600000250017001							66389192 Bytes	3846	5752	3073297351	RGB	8	600	asu06600000250017001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1014	1014	1015.jp2	/asu0660/image/1015.jp2
Margaret Fuller: Commitment In Italy					Taylor, H. Leland																											asu0660000025	This cause is ours, above all others; we ought to show that we  feel it to be so. At present there is no likelihood of war, but in  case of it I trust the United States would not fail in some noble  token of sympathy toward this country. The soul of our nation  need not wait for its government; these things are better done  by individuals. ...  Ah! America, with all thy rich boons, thou hast a heavy account  to render for the talent given; see in every way that thou be not  found wanting.  ROME, December, 1847 [Meditation on Revolution]  The history of our planet in some moments seems so painfully  mean and little,—such terrible bafflings and failures to compensate some brilliant successes,—such a crashing of the mass  of men beneath the feet of a few, and these, too, often the least  worthy,—such a small drop of honey to each cup of gall, and,  in many cases, so mingled that it is never one moment in life  purely tasted,—above all, so little achieved for Humanity as a  whole, such tides of war and pestilence intervening to blot out  the traces of each triumph,—that no wonder if the strongest  soul sometimes pauses aghast; no wonder if the many indolently  console themselves with gross joys and frivolous prizes. . . .  If we consider the amount of truth that has really been spoken  out in the world, and the love that has beat in private hearts,—  how genius has decked each spring-time with such splendid  flowers, conveying each one enough of instruction in its life of  harmonious energy, and how continually, unquenchably, the  spark of faith has striven to burst into flame and light up the *  universe,—the public failure seems amazing, seems monstrous.  ROME, December, 1847 [God Bless the Abolitionists!]  How it pleases me here to think of the Abolitionists! I could  never endure to be with them at home, they were so tedious,  often so narrow, always so rabid and exaggerated in their tone.  But, after all, they had a high motive, something eternal in their  desire and life; and if it was not the only thing worth thinking  of, it was really something worth living and dying for, to free  a great nation from such a terrible blot, such a threatening  plague. God strengthen them, and make them wise to achieve  their purpose!  ROME, December 17, 1847 [The Pope Backs Down]  [The Pope implied] that he meant only to improve, not to reform, and should keep things in statu quo, safe locked with the  keys of St. Peter. This little speech was made, no doubt, more to  reassure czars, emperors, and kings, than from the promptings  of the spirit.

ROME, January 10, 1848 [Only An Aside on Art]  Now I have mentioned a picture, let me say a word or two  about Art and artists, by way of parenthesis in this letter so  much occupied with political affairs.  ROME, March 29, 1848 [The Only Really Nobles]  This happened last week. The news of the dethronement of  Louis Philippe reached us just after the close of the Carnival.  It was just a year from my leaving Paris. I did not think, as I  looked with such disgust on the empire of sham he had established in France, and saw the soul of the people imprisoned and  held fast as in an iron vice, that it would burst its chains so soon.  Whatever be the result, France has done gloriously; she has declared that she will not be satisfied with pretexts while there are  facts in the world,—that to stop her march is a vain attempt,  though the onward path be dangerous and difficult. It is vain to  cry, Peace! peace! when there is no peace. The news from  France, in these days, sounds ominous, though still vague. It  would appear that the political is being merged in the social  struggle: it is well. Whatever blood is to be shed, whatever altars  cast down, those tremendous problems must be solved, whatever  be the cost! That cost cannot fail to break many a bank, many a  heart, in Europe, before the good can bud again out of a mighty  corruption. To you, people of America, it may perhaps be given  to look on and learn in time for a preventive wisdom. You may  learn the real meaning of the words Fraternity, Equality:  you may, despite the apes of the past who strive to tutor you,  learn the needs of a true democracy. You may in time learn to  reverence, learn to guard, the" true aristocracy of a nation, the  only really nobles,—the Laboring Classes.  ROME, March 29, 1848 [Financing the Cause]  A man all in rags gave two pauls. "It is," said he, "all I have."  "Then," said Torlonia, "take from me this dollar." The man of  rags thanked him warmly, and handed that also to the bench,  which refused to receive it. "No! that must stay with you,"  shouted all present. These are the people whom the traveller  accuses of being unable to rise above selfish considerations;—a  nation rich and glorious by nature, capable, like all nations, all  men, of being degraded by slavery, capable, as are few nations,  few men, of kindling into pure flame at the touch of a ray from  the Sun of Truth, of Life.  17 • 	asu06600000250019001							66358408 Bytes	3861	5727	3250170275	RGB	8	600	asu06600000250019001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1016	1016	1017.jp2	/asu0660/image/1017.jp2

Channing:] I have been engrossed, stunned almost,  by the public events that have succeeded one another with such  rapidity and grandeur. It is a time such as I always dreamed of,  and for long secretly hoped to see. I rejoice to be in Europe at  this time, and I shall return possessed of a great history. Perhaps  I shall be called to act. At present, I know not where to go, what  to do. War is everywhere. I cannot leave Rome, and the men of  Rome are marching out every day into Lombardy. The citadel  of Milan is in the hands of my friends, Guerriere, &c, but there  may be need to spill much blood yet in Italy. France and Germany are not in such a state that I can go there now. A glorious  flame burns higher and higher in the heart of the nations.  ROME, April 1, 1848 [Independence!]  Returning to Rome, I find the news pronounced official, that the  viceroy Ranieri has capitulated at Verona; that Italy is free,  independent, and one. I trust this will prove no April-foolery,  no premature news; it seems too good, too speedy a realization  of hope, to have come on earth.  ROME, April 19, 1848 [The Polish Manifesto]  Their great poet, Adam Mickiewicz, has been here to enroll the  Italian Poles, publish the declaration of faith in which they hope  to re-enter and re-establish their country, and receive the Pope's  benediction on their banner. In their declaration of faith are  found these three articles:—  "Every one of the nation a citizen,—every citizen equal in rights  and before authorities.  "To the Jew, our elder brother, respect, brotherhood, aid on the  way to his eternal and terrestrial good, entire equality in political  and civil rights.  "To the companion of life, woman, citizenship, entire equality  of rights."  This last expression of just thought the Poles ought to initiate,  for what other nation has had such truly heroic women? Women  indeed,—not children, servants, or playthings.  ROME, April 19, 1848 [Yet Mazzini Sees Not AU]  He will see his predictions accomplishing yet for a long time,  for Mazzini has a mind far in advance of his times in general,  and his nation in particular. . . .  •  18 	asu06600000250020001							67906540 Bytes	3921	5771	4113754300	RGB	8	600	asu06600000250020001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1017	1017	1018.jp2	/asu0660/image/1018.jp2

Of this, more anon;  but not to-day, nor in the small print of the Tribune. Suffice it  to say, I allude to that of which the cry of Communism, the systems of Fourier, &c, are but forerunners.  ROME, April 30, 1848 [A Role in the Revolution?]  It is a time such as I always dreamed of; and that fire burns in  the hearts of men around me which can keep me warm. Have I  something to do here? or am I only to cheer on the warriors,  and after write the history of their deeds? The first is all I have  done yet, but many have blessed me for my sympathy, and blest  me by the action it impelled.  ROME, May 7, 1848 [Another Papal Apology]  The speech of the Pope declared, that he had never any thought  of the great results which had followed his actions; that he had  only intended local reforms, such as had previously been suggested by the potentates of Europe; that he regretted the mmise  which had been made of his name; and wound up by lamenting  over the war,—dear to every Italian heart as the best and holiest  cause in which for ages they had been called to embark their  hopes,—as if it was something offensive to the spirit of religion,  and which he would fain see hushed up, and its motives smoothed out and ironed over.  ROME, May 7, 1848 [Hope for Italy]  All lies in the future; and our best hope must be that the Power  which has begun so great a work will find due means to end it,  and make the year 1850 a year of true jubilee to Italy; a year  not merely of pomps and tributes, but of recognized rights and  intelligent joys; a year of real peace,—peace, founded not on  compromise and the lying etiquettes of diplomacy, but on truth  and justice. . . .  Hoping this era, I remain at present here. Should my hopes be  dashed to the ground, it will not change my faith, but the  struggle for its manifestation is to me of vital interest. My  friends write to urge my return; they talk of our country as the  land of the future.

My country is at present spoiled by prosperity, stupid  with the lust of gain, soiled by crime in its willing perpetuation  of slavery, shamed by an unjust war, noble sentiment much forgotten even by individuals, the aims of politicians selfish or  petty, the literature frivolous and venal. In Europe, amid the  teachings of adversity, a nobler spirit is struggling,—a spirit  which cheers and animates mine. I hear earnest words of pure  faith and love. I see deeds of brotherhood. This is what makes  my America. I do not deeply distrust my country. She is not  dead, but in my time she sleepeth, and the spirit of our fathers  flames no more, but lies hid beneath the ashes. It will not be  so long; bodies cannot live when the soul gets too overgrown  with gluttony and falsehood.

ROME, February 20, 1849 [Habit Yields to Truth]  The revolution, like all genuine ones, has been instinctive, its  results unexpected and surprising to the greater part of those  who achieved them. The waters, which had flowed so secretly  beneath the crust of habit that many never heard their murmur,  unless in dreams, have suddenly burst to light in full and beautiful jets; all rush to drink the pure and living draught.  As in the time of Jesus, the multitude had been long enslaved  beneath a cumbrous ritual, their minds designedly darkened by  those who should have enlightened them, brutified, corrupted,  amid monstrous contradictions and abuses; yet the moment they  hear a word correspondent to the original nature, "Yes, it is  true," they cry. "It is spoken with authority. Yes, it ought to  be so. Priests ought to be better and wiser than other men; if  they were, they would not need pomp and temporal power to  command respect. Yes, it is true; we ought not to lie; we  should not try to impose upon one another. We ought rather to  prefer that our children should work honestly for their bread,  than get it by cheating, begging, or the prostitution of their  mothers. It would be better to act worthily and kindly, probably  would please God more than the kissing of relics. We have long  darkly felt that these things were so; now we know it."  ROME, February 20, 1849 [Cannot America Help?]  How I wish my country would show some noble sympathy  when an experience so like her own is going on. Politically she  cannot interfere; but formerly, when Greece and Poland were  struggling, they were at least aided by private contributions.  Italy, naturally so rich, but long racked and impoverished by her  oppressors, greatly needs money to arm and clothe her troops.  Some token of sympathy, too, from America would be so welcome to her now. If there were a circle of persons inclined to  trust such to me, I might venture to promise the trust should  be used to the advantage of Italy. It would make me proud to  have my country show a religious faith in the progress of ideas,  and make some small sacrifice of its own great resources in aid  of a sister cause, now.  ROME, May 27, 1849 [The Revolution is Now Radical]  The struggle is now fairly, thoroughly commenced between the  principle of democracy and the old powers, no longer legitimate.

All Europe, including Great Britain, where the most  bitter resistance of all will be made, is to be under republican  government in the next century. ...  Every struggle made by the old tyrannies, all their Jesuitical  deceptions, their rapacity, their imprisonments and executions  of the most generous men, only sow more dragon's teeth; the  crop shoots up daily more and more plenteous.  When I first arrived in Italy, the vast majority of this people  had no wish beyond limited monarchies, constitutional governments. They still respected the famous names of the nobility;  they despised the priests, but were still fondly attached to the  dogmas and ritual of the Roman Catholic Church. It required  King Bomba, the triple treachery of Charles Albert, Pius IX.,  and the "illustrious Gioberti," the naturally kind-hearted, but,  from the necessity of his position, cowardly and false Leopold  of Tuscany, the vagabond "serene" meannesses of Parma and  Modena, the "fatherly" Radetzsky, and, finally, the imbecile  Louis Bonaparte, "would-be Emperor of France," to convince  this people that no transition is possible between the old and the  new. The work is done; the revolution in Italy is now radical,  nor can it stop till Italy becomes independent and united as a  republic.  ROME, May 27, 1849 [American Intransigence]  It has wounded both the heart and the pride of Rome. Some  of the lowest people have asked me, "Is it not true that your  country had a war to become free?" "Yes." "Then why do they  not feel for us?"  Yet even now it is not too late. If America would only hail  triumphant, though she could not sustain injured Rome, that  would be something. "Can you suppose Rome will triumph,"  you say, "without money, and against so potent a league of  foes?" I am not sure, but I hope, for I believe something in the  heart of a people when fairly awakened. I have also a lurking  confidence in what our fathers spoke of so constantly, a providential order of things, by which brute force and selfish enterprise are sometimes set at naught by aid which seems to descend from a higher sphere. Even old pagans believed in that,  you know; and I was born in America, Christianized by the  Puritans,—America, freed by eight years' patient suffering,  poverty, and struggle,—America, so cheered in dark days by  one spark of sympathy from a foreign shore,—America, first  "recognized" by Lafayette. I saw him when traversing our country, then great, rich, and free. Millions of men who owed in  part their happiness to what, no doubt, was once sneered at as  romantic sympathy, threw garlands in his path. It is natural that  I should have some faith.  • 22 	asu06600000250024001							68477160 Bytes	3956	5768	581974145	RGB	8	600	asu06600000250024001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1021	1021	1022.jp2	/asu0660/image/1022.jp2
Margaret Fuller: Commitment In Italy					Taylor, H. Leland																											asu0660000025	ROME, June 10, 1849 [The Bombardment]  [To R. W. Emerson:] I received your letter amid the round of  cannonade and musketry. It was a terrible battle fought here  from the first to the last light of day. I could see all in its  progress from my balcony. The Italians fought like lions. It is  a truly heroic spirit that animates them. They make a stand  here for honor and their rights, with little ground for hope that  they can resist, now they are betrayed by France.  ROME, July 4, 1849 [Capitulation]  Yes; July 4th, the day so joyously celebrated in our land, is  that of the entrance of the French into Rome!  ROME, July 10, 1849 [My Italy!]  It is true, their resources were at any rate inadequate to resistance; only continual sorties would have arrested the progress  of the foe, and to make them and man the wall their forces  were inadequate. I was struck more than ever by the heroic  valor of our people,—let me so call them now as ever; for go  where I may, a large part of my heart will ever remain in Italy.  I hope her children will always acknowledge me as a sister,  though I drew not my first breath here.  ROME, July 10, 1849 [Too Late, America!]  I see you have meetings, where you speak of the Italians, the  Hungarians. I pray you do something; let it not end in a mere  cry of sentiment. That is better than to sneer at all that is liberal, like the English,—than to talk of the holy victims of  patriotism as "anarchists" and "brigands"; but it is not enough.  It ought not to content your consciences. Do you owe no tithe  to Heaven for the privileges it has showered on you, for whose  achievement so many here suffer and perish daily? Deserve to  retain them, by helping your fellow-men to acquire them. Our  government must abstain from interference, but private action  is practicable, is due. For Italy, it is in this moment too late; but  all that helps Hungary helps her also,—helps all who wish the  freedom of men from an hereditary yoke now become intolerable. Send money, send cheer,—acknowledge as the legitimate  leaders and rulers those men who represent the people, who  understand their wants, who are ready to die or to live for  their good. Kossuth I know not, but his people recognize him;  Manin I know not, but with what firm nobleness, what perserv-  ing virtue, he has acted for Venice! Mazzini I know, the man  and his acts, great, pure, and constant,—a man to whom only  the next age can do justice, as it reaps the harvest of the seed he  has sown in this. Friends, countrymen, and lovers of virtue,  lovers of freedom, lovers of truth! be on the alert; rest not  supine in your easier lives, but remember  "Mankind is one,  And beats with one great heart."  23   • 	asu06600000250025001							66452760 Bytes	3837	5771	1462897230	RGB	8	600	asu06600000250025001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1022	1022	1023.jp2	/asu0660/image/1023.jp2
Margaret Fuller: Commitment In Italy					Taylor, H. Leland																											asu0660000025	How much of Margaret Fuller's commitment to radical reform was impelled by circumstances and how much was the  maturation of an ideology is difficult to determine and largely  irrelevant. It is equally difficult and irrelevant to ascertain  whether the woman who sailed homeward in 1850 was indeed  a revolutionary or whether (as the record seems to indicate)  extreme personal hardship on one hand and the new security  of family on the other had created another version of pastoral.  What is well documented and worth recalling is that the Italy  of 1848-49 provided an occasion and Margaret Fuller rose to it.  FOOTNOTES  i Houghton Library,  undated  MS journal.  Quoted  in  F.

Theodore Spicer-Simson's "Peace Medal"					Rosner, George W.																											asu0660000025	Theodore Spicer-Simson's  "Peace Medal"  By George W. Rosner  In 1914 at the outbreak of the European War, Theodore  Spicer-Simson, a British national, was living in Paris. Forty-three  years old and approaching the peak of his career, he had international recognition as an outstanding sculptor-medallist with  several distinguished awards to his credit. Aware that his creative  art could not survive the destructive elements of war, he and  Margaret, his American born wife, fled the rapidly advancing  German armies. At Le Havre they were fortunate to get passage  to the United States aboard the lie de France.  From several earlier sojourns in New York and Washington,  D.C., Theodore had established friendships and business connections with quite a few socially prominent and wealthy patrons.  It was a time when society leaders, enraged by the reports of war  atrocities, forsook their normal pursuits and embraced many  humanitarian causes. Among these was the American Fund for  French Wounded, whose treasurer was Anne Morgan, daughter  of J. Pierpont Morgan, Jr. This organization with its hundreds  of branches throughout the country had since the very beginning  of the war supplied necessities and comforts to French base hospitals. America's entry into the conflct substantially increased  patriotic fervor. The prospect of American soldiers needing hospital help "over there" added further stimulus. However, more  funds were needed.  Theodore was commissioned to design and execute a medal,  the sale of which would produce the necessary revenue. This  medal commemorated the United States' entry into the War, the  actual date being part of the design on its reverse side. The obverse side, in delicate relief, is remarkable for its concentrated  symbolism. Theodore described it as:  On the shield, held together by the Sword of War, are the  European allies. At the upper left is Great Britain and her  colonies, the naval power in the war pictured as a ship. Immediately below is the Cock of France, then the Cross of Savoy for  25 • 	asu06600000250027001							66487340 Bytes	3837	5774	3461159622	RGB	8	600	asu06600000250027001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1024	1024	1025.jp2	/asu0660/image/1025.jp2

At the upper right  the Russian Bear breaks out toward the sea. Below it the Belgian  Lion is seen appealing to England and France. By its side are  four Serbian characters, the initials of the motto of Serbia, and  now also of Belgium, "Union Is Strength." Below this is the  rising sun of Japan.  Sales were phenomenal. Volunteer workers, scores of women  and girls prominent in social and diplomatic circles, could not  keep up with demands. In anticipation of requests for over a  million replicas, other local organizations countrywide — girls'  and boys' clubs, schools, societies, and even some commercial  firms — offered help in preparing shipments. The first three  medals struck were cast in gold. These were taken to France by  Anne Morgan where they were presented to Field Marshall  Joffre, President Poincare and former premier Rene Viviani.  Somewhat later another gold replica was presented to Sarah  Bernhardt.  The medal became known popularly as "America's War  Medal," the "Victory Medal" (probably because of the laurel  wreath on the reverse), and finally the "Peace Medal."  COVER: GEORGE BERNARD SHAW  Portrait medallion by Theodore Spicer-Simson made in 1921. Cast  bronze, 99mm. Copies are in the British Museum, London; the  Bibliotheque Nationale's Cabinet des Medailles, Paris; the University of Miami.  In a letter to Spicer-Simson (January 1922) Shaw said, "The Medallion has  come to hand. It comes out very well in the bronze. To me, the most astonishing thing about you is that I never heard of you until you approached me for  my fossilization, I could not be impervious to the reputation of a master of  your quality if it had been adequately focussed on London."

Florida's Literature					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000026	THE  CARRE LL  Volume 14      June & December 1973      Numbers 1 & 2  Florida's Literature  By Evelyn Helmick  Florida, with her romantic story of exploration, her remoteness from other centers of early American civilization, her  beauties of semi-tropical landscape and miles of seashore,  has long been an inspiration to writers. As Theodore Irving wrote in  his story of early Florida:  It was poetry put into action; it was the knight errantry of the old world  carried into the depths of the American wilderness; indeed, the personal  adventures, the feats of individual prowess, the picturesque descriptions  of steel clad cavaliers,. . . would seem to us mere fictions of romance, did  they not come to us recorded in matter of fact narratives of contemporaries, and corroborated by minute and daily memoranda of eye witnesses. 1  The earliest authors were not Americans at all, or even writers of  the English Language, but rather those Spanish noblemen who accompanied the great explorers into the territory. By keeping diaries,  writing memoirs of their experiences, or trying to capture portraits  of the great men such as De Soto, they created, often poetically indeed, the literature of the sixteenth-century Floridas.  Although historians such as Herrera and Peter Martyr had written accounts of Ponce de Leon's first two voyages from the tales of  returning explorers, the first important story of Florida written in  the New World was by Cabeza de Vaca, an officer with the expedition led by Narvaez. Adventurers in the Unknown Interior of  America, published in 1555, tells of seven years' wandering in the  wilderness. The marveling, hyperbolic phrases are not always  truthful; but here is an example of sixteenth-century prose-  typically flowery, always pointing to the "visible hand of God" in  the fortunes of the explorers. De Vaca's account is notable too as  the first expression of love for the land of Florida, of admiration for  the handsome Indian tribes. 	asu06600000260003001							66250696 Bytes	3899	5662	3364127777	RGB	8	600	asu06600000260003001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1037	1037	1038.jp2	/asu0660/image/1038.jp2
Florida's Literature					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000026	A more informative history of the De Soto expedition is found in  the anonymous True Relation of the Hardships Suffered by Governor Fernando de Soto and Certain Portuguese Gentlemen during  the Discovery of the Province of Florida. Written by one known  only as "a gentleman of Elvas," it is accepted as an accurate, as well  as a literate account. First published in Portuguese in 1557, it was  later included among the Voyages translated and published by  Richard Hakluyt in English. In 1605 Garcilaso de la Vega wrote  another history of De Soto, this time a poetic biography, weaving  descriptions of Indian customs and fanciful battle scenes into an  immediate narrative. Hardly accurate history (it has been called "a  romance founded on facts"), this book was praised by Florida's first  literary historian for its "grace and fascination of style," "gorgeous  and vivid picturing," and originality of diction.2 Even Robert  Southey found it "one of the most delightful narratives in the  Spanish language:" Among Americans who have admired de la  Vega's narrative was Theodore Irving, who discovered the history in  Madrid and used it as the basis of his scholarly and elegant Conquest of Florida in 1835. 3  The period of French settlement from 1562 to 1567 is marked by  the works of two outstanding authors, Ribaut and Laudonniere. In  1563 Jean Ribaut's Whole and True Discouerye of Terra Florida  was published in English. Actually a report to Admiral Coligny, the  book is a combination of natural history and historical narrative, all  infused with the same sense of God's hand in the destiny of man as  the earlier Spanish accounts. It is among the early Florida histories  reprinted by Hakluyt. Ribaut's successor, Rene Laudonniere, wrote  the longest account of the French settlement at Fort Caroline, The  Notable History of Florida, first published in Paris in 1586. Laudon-  niere's chapters contain the only description of the extinct Timu-  cuan tribes, and, along with Ribaut's report, constitute the only account of the Coligny colonies.  The most important later work written from a Frenchman's point  of view is by Achille Murat, nephew of Napoleon and citizen of the  United States, who lived in Florida in the early part of the nineteenth century, first, on his plantation "Parthenope" near  Jacksonville, then on "Lipona" near Tallahassee. His Moral and Political Sketch of the United States of North America is a series of  wide-ranging discussions of politics, slavery, economics, Indians,  and literature, among other topics, all written in that personal, literary style that qualifies these early histories as belles-lettres.4 Murat  remarks that the numerous periodicals of the country have strong 	asu06600000260004001							66405728 Bytes	3880	5703	2180775441	RGB	8	600	asu06600000260004001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1038	1038	1039.jp2	/asu0660/image/1039.jp2
Florida's Literature					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000026	political bias, that cities such as the new Tallahassee seem magically  to grow out of the forest overnight, that Charleston society is the  best of Europe as well as America, that austere public morals in  America inhibit the development of the arts. He praises the practical liberty that he finds in the United States, opposed to the merely  metaphysical liberty of Europe. Throughout the book, the remarkable personality of this prince turned frontiersman is apparent.5  The literature of Florida written in English begins with the  genres which initiate American literature as a whole—the journals,  diaries, and travel narratives of settlers in a new, wondrously  strange land. They did not need to create fiction, for the whole of  existence seemed a fiction to those experiencing a life in which  they must create all order, a new society, civilization itself. But even  frontiersmen recorded something of what was occurring. This was  true in Florida as it was elsewhere. Hence such familiar titles as  "Sketches," "Relations," "Accounts of," never forgetting "God's  Protecting Providence." That phrase, in fact, begins the title of an  early narrative by a victim of a shipwreck off the Florida coast in  1696. In its entirety, the title of the book, one of the first from the  Philadelphia press, is  God's Protecting Providence Man's Surest Help and Defense, In the times  of the greatest difficulty and most Imminent danger, Evidenced in the  Remarkable Deliverance of divers Persons from the devouring Waves of  the Sea, amongst which they suffered Shipwrack, And also from the more  cruelly devouring jawes of the inhumane Cannibals of Florida. Faithfully  related by one of the Persons concerned therein.  The party, sailing from Port Royal bound for Philadelphia, were  captured by the Indians after their wreck off Jupiter Island and  saved their lives only by claiming to be Spanish. Jonathan Dickenson, his wife and infant son, along with the Quaker missionary  Robert Barrow, then made their way to St. Augustine, where they  were graciously received by Governor Laureano de Torres. The adventure was first published in 1700, and before 1868 it had gone  through fifteen more editions.  The first professional writer to tell a story of Florida was William  Roberts, who collaborated with Thomas Jefferys, the royal  geographer, when the English gained control in 1763. Called An  Account of the First Discovery and Natural History of Florida, it  was not a natural history at all, but was valued for its historical narrative and descriptions of Indian customs by those Englishmen  eager for knowledge of the new colony. 	asu06600000260005001							66412420 Bytes	3840	5763	563558890	RGB	8	600	asu06600000260005001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1039	1039	1040.jp2	/asu0660/image/1040.jp2
Florida's Literature					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000026	The writing of the natural history of Florida, fortunately, was  reserved for the Bartrams, father and son. John Bartram, "Botanist  to His Majesty for both the Floridas," sent a journal of his trip  through the peninsula to his friends in England, who had it  published in 1776 as part of William Stork's Account of East Florida.  The possessor of greater literary talent than his father, William  Bartram later wrote his famous Travels from his field journals,  poetically describing his trip through the Carolinas, Georgia, and  Florida. The critics of his time little appreciated his literary gifts;  one reviewer regretted that  with his opportunities, this amiable author had not written with a greater  degree of systematic precision, and with fewer pages of mere exclamatory  admiration at the beauties and wonders of nature. 6  But the reader would be poorer indeed if Bartram had weeded from  his scientific descriptions such exclamations as  How harmonious the shrill tuneful songs of the wood thrush, and the  soothing love lays of the amorous cuckoo! seated in the cool leafy  branches of the stately Magnolias and the shadowy Elms, Maples and Liquid-amber, together with gigantic Fagussylvatica, which shade and perfume these sequestered groves. How unexpected and enchanting the enjoyment, after traversing a burning sandy desert!.7  Part II, nearly half of the Travels, deals with Florida. There Bartram  discusses, in addition to the plant and animal life, such things as a  hurricane, the colonial governor, and an Indian ceremony. His  descriptions so fascinated Europeans that his book went through  eight or nine editions on the continent after its publication in Philadelphia in 1791. Among interested readers were several of the  English romantic poets: Coleridge, pronouncing it "a work of high  merit every way," borrowed some of the material for the imagery in  "Christabel," "Kubla Khan," and "The Rime of the Ancient  Mariner"; Wordsworth showed that he had read it in "Ruth" and  "I Wander'd Lonely As a Cloud." Southey, Shelley, and Tennyson  are other poets whose work shows the influence of Bartram. The  French diplomat and romanticist, Francois Chateaubriand, wrote a  novel in 1801 called Atala, using much description from the Travels.  The years from 1783 to 1821, the second period of Spanish  supremacy, saw little literary output of any kind. In the year of  Florida's acquisition by the United States, there appeared a book by  James Grant Forbes, a native of Florida. His Sketches, Historical and  Topographical, of the Floridas: more particularly of East Florida is in 	asu06600000260006001							67339696 Bytes	3912	5736	1364562347	RGB	8	600	asu06600000260006001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1040	1040	1041.jp2	/asu0660/image/1041.jp2
Florida's Literature					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000026	two parts: the first, an inadequate, rather pedestrian history of the  new territory; the second, a literary description of its towns, rivers,  and lakes. The history written by Forbes, although based partly on  first-hand knowledge and partly on documents, begins history that  is a product of research, rather than the expression of personal experience. Although imaginative native letters were yet in the  future, the character of Florida's literature was undergoing a  change, not to be completed until the twentieth century.  II  The story of literary Florida in the nineteenth century is one of  prominent authors who, having made their reputations elsewhere,  wrote of the southernmost state for its exotic background or for its  fabulous history. One of these was John James Audubon, who  visited Florida in the winter of 1831-1832 to make some of the  drawings in Birds of America and to write the Ornithological Biography  accompanying the pictures. His description is not confined to birds;  in one passage about the Florida Keys, he says:  With what delightful feelings did we gaze on the objects around us! —the  gorgeous flowers, the singular plants, the luxuriant trees. The balmy air  which we breathed filled us with animation, so pure and salubrious did it  seem to be.8  Another visitor at least as enthusiastic as Audubon was Harriet  Beecher Stowe, who moved to Mandarin on the St. Johns River in  1872. HerPalmetto Leaves is a meandering discussion of her natural  surroundings, as well as her dog, mule, cat, and relatives. The book  ends on a subject closely allied with her name as she warns that  "the prosperity of Southern States must depend, in a large degree,  on the right treatment and education of the negro population." 9  The influx of visitors to the state after 1821 prompted the writing  of many guidebooks. Perhaps the most famous is Sidney Lanier's  Florida: Its Scenery, Climate, and History, commissioned by a railroad  company. Although expressing, in a letter to his wife, his doubts  about writing a guidebook and invoking the names of poets from  Homer to Keats, he concluded that the large amount of money  offered would compensate for the descent to hack work. And yet  the result is one of the most delightful descriptions of the Florida  country; even the chapter written for consumptives is entertaining  reading. His prose in this guidebook reveals a wry humor as well as  many of the characteristics of his poetry.

Florida's Literature					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000026	3as£^  history of the state, for example, he comments on savage acts like  the plundering and burning of a missionary station:  That such things could go on down among these green woods and  streams-wbere any man in his senses must, one would think, be drawn by  the very force of nature into large labors and peaceful dreams—is to me  only another proof that the world has not nearly enough insane  asylums.10  And one of Lanier's typical poetic devices appears when he says  that the Florida pines make some people uncomfortable as sermons  do: "For indeed these pines always preach. They are religion carven  into trunks and branches and cones."11 Another nineteenth-century poet, William Cullen Bryant, wrote a guide as prosaic as  Lanier's was poetic. Letters XIII, XIV, and XV of his Letters of a  Traveller center about St. Augustine.  The single significant poem written about the state during this  period is also about St. Augustine. Ralph Waldo Emerson, after  visiting that city in 1827, wrote a short lyric poem about it ("There  liest thou, little city of the deep") on his return to New England.  Two famous novelists turned their attention to Florida during the  century, one to set his story in the Keys, the other to write fictional  accounts of Florida history. James Fenimore Cooper wrote Jack  Tier: or the Florida Reef 'in 1848, a story of the ship Molly Swash and  her captain who is smuggling gunpowder to the Mexicans. Despite  some tense scenes of navigational feats, the book hardly ranks with  Cooper's best, with its flat characterizations (especially of Rose  Budd, the heroine) and the improbable surprise ending. More interesting are two novels by William Gilmore Simms. One, The Lily  and the Totem: or, The Huguenots in Florida , Simms says, belongs to  the class of writings called the "romance of history." It begins with  the earliest voyage of Ribaut, reading much like history, until the  fiction, meant to be simply "tributary," predominates. The appendix includes the narrative poem Simms originally intended to make  out of this material. The second novel, Vasconselos, a Romance of the  New World, is a tightly constructed story of the men accompanying  De Soto in 1538. In the opening Simms states his belief that "It is  the province of romance, even more decidedly than history, to  recall the deeds and adventures of the past." And he is able here to  suggest the world of the early explorers.  One example of the early short story with a Florida setting is well-  known: Stephen Crane, recounting a personal experience, wrote  "The Open Boat" about a shipwreck off the coast at New Smyrna. 	asu06600000260008001							68877744 Bytes	3997	5742	3197525699	RGB	8	600	asu06600000260008001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1042	1042	1043.jp2	/asu0660/image/1043.jp2
Florida's Literature					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000026	Written in 1898, the story is indicative of the kind of literature  about Florida that was to follow in the twentieth century.  Ill  The novels and short stories, plays and poems about Florida that  soon began to appear in profusion again were of two types —those  based on the state's history, and those trying to capture the sense of  place. In the first category, Ponce de Leon's legendary search for  the Fountain of Youth remained a theme for modern writers. One  of the earliest expressions of it is Eugene O'Neill's in his play The  Fountain, a romantic drama by an important experimenter in the  realistic theater. Not a great, or even a very interesting play, The  Fountain ends as Ponce de Leon realizes that "there is no gold but  love." Five years later, in 1926, Stephen Vincent Benet, who was to  show further interest in the South with his Civil War poem John  Brown's Body, wrote Spanish Bayonet. In this novel, set near the St.  Augustine of 1774, he relates the spirit of Floridians to that of the  northern colonists: a young Englishman, after helping a Minorcan  uprising on an indigo plantation, understands the colonists' revolt  against England and returns to join the Continental Army. Another  novel, At the Moon's Inn, written in 1941 by Andrew Lytle, is a fictionalized account of De Soto's journey in Florida.  James Branch Cabell, of Jurgen fame, emerged from his mythical  land of Poictesme long enough to write several books about St.  Augustine. That city from 1561 to 1574 is the subject of The First  Gentleman of America, A Comedy of Conquest. Cabell classifies this as  a "legend based on fact." It is the third part of his trilogy Heirs and  Assigns. His next trilogy, set entirely in St. Augustine and its environs, is titled It Happened in Florida. In The St. Johns, written in collaboration with the historian A. J. Hanna, he brilliantly tells of  "Florida's well-nigh uniformly fantastic chronicle." The history of  the St. Johns region is recounted here in terms of its inhabitants,  especially the literary figures. Satirical, irreverent, witty, it is  perhaps the most irrepressible survey of a region since Washington  Irving's Knickerbocker History. There Were Two Pirates, A Comedy of  Division, the supposed autobiography of the pirate Gasparilla, appeared in 1946. Cabell says he has edited from Gasparilla's journals  such irrelevant matter as a catalogue of ships, stories of murder and  scandal, leaving only the facts bearing on the events in the pirate's  life. The tone is comic and satirical —typically Cabell.

Florida's Literature					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000026	Augustine and Hell (with apparent similarities between the two  places) he turns his satire to present-day Florida.  For other contemporary novelists and playwrights, Florida's  history has lost none of its fascination. BuddSchulberg published in  1958 Across the Everglades, a story first written as a screenplay. A  protest against the possible extinction of egrets and blue herons by  plume hunters, the play had as its hero an Audubon warden; as its  setting, the vast sweep of the Everglades. Another play set in  Florida is Seminole: A Drama of the Florida Indian by Theodore Pratt,  based largely on historical figures, which like his Big Blow, is written  as both novel and drama. Of Pratt's steady output, much is set entirely in Florida, including his trilogy, The Barefoot Mailman, The  Flame Tree, and The Big Bubble, telling the history of the state between 1880 and 1924. Dr. Frank Slaughter writes of the same places  and the same era. His novels, often centered about a surgeon hero,  include The Golden Isle, set in 1816, Fort Everglades and Army  Surgeon, in 1840 during the Indian Wars, and Storm Haven, in the  1860's, among others.  Florida has interested modern authors even more for her unique  climate and landscape than for her fabulous history. The first twentieth-century book to use that setting, however, did not choose it  because of beauty or uniqueness, but because of its location at the  twenty-eighth parallel. Jules Verne, in 1905, was aware that any trip  through space must proceed from that latitude and chose Florida  over Texas as the site of his rocket launching in From the Earth to the  Moon because Florida had no cities of importance to quarrel over  the exact location. His Tampa Town is a primitive place indeed.  But before Jules Verne's novel the Florida genius loci had been  captured by Constance Fenimore Woolson. The grandniece of  James Fenimore Cooper, she wrote in and about both northern and  southern states, always to some degree as a local colorist; but her  work on Florida is undoubtedly her best. She published numerous  poems about the state in periodicals of the 1870's, many short stories (the most significant here is "The South Devil" in the Atlantic  Monthly in 1880), and one novel, East Angels, in 1886. Henry James,  praising her "feat of evoking a local tone," found it a very satisfactory novel, and a critic for the Saturday Review over forty years later  suggested a revival of Miss Woolson's work because of the "scenic  note in her stories that haunts one unforgettably." He ranked her  interpretation of country with the work of Thomas Hardy.  Edwin Granberry has been called the leading Florida novelist of  the first thirty years of this century for Strangers and Lovers of 1928 	asu06600000260010001							66981452 Bytes	3913	5704	593907799	RGB	8	600	asu06600000260010001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1044	1044	1045.jp2	/asu0660/image/1045.jp2
Florida's Literature					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000026	and The Erl King of 1930. The first story takes place in the southern  part of the state during World War I; the second, near St. Augustine  in 1910. The novels, poetically written, owe much to their setting.  In the thirties, three works with Florida backgrounds were  published by famous writers. Tropical Winter, by Joseph  Hergesheimer, appeared in 1933. It is a group of short stories about  the wealthy in Palm Beach of that era. In 1937 Ernest Hemingway  wrote To Have and Have Not set in Key West and Havana. The  novel and the later film are among the best-known literary expressions of the time; in many ways Harry Morgan is the hero of the  period. The Keys formed the setting of a play near the end of this  decade in Maxwell Anderson's Key Largo, a formal tragedy in verse,  like the author's earlier Winterset. The play, about a soldier who has  failed to perform courageously, has much of the emotional power of  Anderson's best drama.  Native Floridians were beginning to write more significant books  at this time; two members of Negro communities are among them.  James Weldon Johnson, born in Jacksonville, became a lawyer,  diplomat, composer, and educator, as well as poet and novelist. He  wrote the fictional Autobiography of an Ex-coloured Man in 1928 and  God's Trombones, a book of poetry. His own autobiography, Along  This Way, presents a considered view of Negro life in northern  Florida. A similar portrait is Zora Neale Hurston's Dust Tracks on a  Road, written in 1942. Living in Eatonville, the only Florida city  planned and managed entirely by Negroes, she wrote important  books on American folklore and two novels—Jonah's Gourd Vine  and Their Eyes Were Watching God— set in Eatonville among the  "teppentime" shacks and on the coast among the shrimp boats.  Miss Hurston's special ability to capture the speech of her people  has caused linguists to call her books "a treasury of lexical items  peculiar to the Negroes of southern Florida." From a literary standpoint, her use of dialect adds much to the richness of her stories.  Another special subject is the Greek colony of sponge fishermen  on the west coast. The most complete description of the community  and its customs is found in The Islanders by Audrey Wurdemann  and her husband Joseph Auslander, known for his Winged Horse  anthology of poetry. Other attempts to tell this story have little literary merit, with the exception of the short stories of Eustace Adams.  In much the same way, the baseball training camps in the state  have only one story worth mentioning: Ring Lardner's "Golden  Wedding."  After his Generation of Vipers, Philip Wylie produced an astound- 	asu06600000260011001							65973604 Bytes	3848	5713	382136570	RGB	8	600	asu06600000260011001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1045	1045	1046.jp2	/asu0660/image/1046.jp2
Florida's Literature					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000026	ing number of books and articles, many of them about the land and  sea near his home in South Miami. Two of his "philosophical  novels," Night unto Night of 1944 and The Disappearance of 1951, his  strongest Jungian statement, are set in Miami. The setting is even  more important in his fishing stories, such as The Big Ones Get  Away, Salt Water Daffy, and Fish and Tin F/s/j.^CrunchandDes^he  humorous heroes of many of his fishing stories, have appeared in  periodicals as well as in books.  Two of the most popular novelists writing in the forties and fifties  chose Florida as the setting for single books. James Gould Cozzens'  Guard of Honor, a dramatic tale of a central Florida air base during  World War II, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1949. Events in that book include a narrowly-averted race riot and the tragic deaths of many  paratroopers stationed at the air base. Herman Wouk, in 1956,  wrote Slattery's Hurricane about Miami and its vicinity. But the  novel in no way matches his earlier Caine Mutiny.  Less well-known, but more knowledgeable about the state are  two novelists whose books are more frequently than not set in  Florida country. The local novels of Rex Beach include Mating Call,  about the boom years, Money Mad, and Wild Pastures,about cattle  raising at the end of the last century. Personal Exposures is his  autobiography, which begins with his boyhood in Tampa and ends  with his return to Florida after adventures in New York and Alaska.  Another prolific writer is Baynard Kendrick, whose novels are  often historical. Perhaps the most interesting is Flames of Time,  about the East Florida Republic between 1787 and 1813.  But if one were to choose //?e Florida novelist, for literary qualities  as well as for sense of place, it would have to be Marjorie Kinnan  Rawlings. Her recognition of the strength of the people in the hammock country, the spareness of her prose to match that country, the  accuracy of her dialect, all create a true regional literature. South  Moon Under and Golden Apples are the two earliest novels about the  Oklawaha River area. When the Whippoorwill is a group of shorter  works, including Jacob's Ladder, a novelette about bean growers and  "Gal Young 4Un" and "Alligator," two important short stories.  Most famous of all her books is The Yearling, the story of a backwoods boy and his fawn, which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1939 and  later was made into a film. Cross Creek is a non-fiction work about  her farm; Cross Creek Cookery, a charming compilation of regional  dishes with Mrs. Rawlings' commentary as added spice. Dominating all of her work is her awareness of the unique characteristics of  10 	asu06600000260012001							68873908 Bytes	3976	5772	3820245211	RGB	8	600	asu06600000260012001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1046	1046	1047.jp2	/asu0660/image/1047.jp2
Florida's Literature					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000026	the land and the people she has chosen. Her people are achingly  real; her descriptions at times breathtaking:  The circle of distant lake was a red fire. The sun dipped suddenly into the  west. The sky flamed and was violent. Every orange tree had for a moment its bright identity. There was an instant when the earth faltered between night and day. The ibis were white feathers at the marsh edge. A bat  flew low under the magnolia in search of insects. Then all the world was  shadow. 14  With such passages, she has given to the Florida scrub country the  dimensions of a myth.  The works of Marjory Stoneman Douglas, another woman who  has written almost exclusively about Florida, are far from mythic.  Her books are carefully researched for their broad information  about the history, the geography, the nature studies of the state.  Her concern with the ecology of Florida is practical as well as literary; one of the first supporters of the Everglades region as a national park and currently a crusader for its preservation, she wrote  The Everglades: River of Grass in 1947 after several years of exploring the then almost unknown area. The books which followed include Road to the Sun, Hurricane, Freedom River, and Alligator Crossing, the latter two for young readers. Slighter publications discuss  bird-watching, landscaping, and fruit growing in South Florida. The  latest of her Florida works is a history, Florida: The Long Frontier, a  fascinating narrative of the whole of Florida's past. Marjory Stone-  man Douglas has done more than any other writer to present a full,  accurate picture of Florida.  One modern writer remains to be discussed because of the relationship of his art to the Florida landscape. Wallace Stevens,  although he was a Connecticut businessman, found in his visits to  Florida the mood and images necessary to his poetic statements.  One biographer says that Stevens' "enthusiastic response" to the  landscape combined with the techniques of modern painting suggested the methods of his subtle poems. In Harmonium we see the  result: the "florid, sensuous, and often wild imagery of the  subtropics."15 In "Nomad Exquisite" the world has jungle  qualities: "the immense dew of Florida / Brings forth / The big-finned palm / And green vine angering for life." Other significant  poems include "Floral Decorations for Bananas," "Fabliau of  Florida," and "The Idea of Order at Key West," one of Stevens'  most famous poems. Between the world and art of Wallace Stevens  11 	asu06600000260013001							65782392 Bytes	3849	5695	26541636	RGB	8	600	asu06600000260013001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1047	1047	1048.jp2	/asu0660/image/1048.jp2

Flannery O'Connor as Seen by a Friend					Walston, Rosa Lee																											asu0660000026	Flannery O'Connor  as Seen by a Friend  By Rosa Lee Walston  If all literature were published anonymously, the study of it  would not be cursed with so much that is irrelevant. You recall  that Wordsworth was referred to almost contemptuously as impeccable until the discovery of his one youthful indiscretion, which  Professor Harper has wittily described as Wordsworth's wild oat,  changed the perspective almost to the point of regarding him as a  libertine.  We must concede, however, that knowledge of an author's life  frequently provides valuable insight into his work as well as yielding titillating anecdotes. And it is only human to desire to know  something of the person who created the fictional persons who  hold us thrall. Now that Flannery O'Connor has become a literary  phenomenon to be reckoned with, those of us privileged to have  known her "in her habit as she lived" are besieged with all manner  of questions. If we do not know the answers, we are assumed to be  holding something back.  It is unfortunate for my recollections that in spite of Flannery's  habitually welcoming manner, I always respected her schedule too  much to make as many visits as I should have enjoyed. On the theory that authors dislike to speak of their own work in progress, I did  not ask the questions that would now permit me to give definitive  answers on even a few of the matters that her public would like to  have cleared up.  Ours was a warm, happy friendship that developed effortlessly  because we found that we could take our agreement on so many  basic assumptions for granted. I have always been glad I never  taught her as it would have been devastating had I failed to recognize her potential. Since I came to the college in Milledgeville the  year after she was graduated from it, I have to depend on the stories  of others for accounts of her earlier years. People chuckled over her  refusal to learn sewing unless she could make clothes for her pet  fowl in lieu of the doll dresses that occupied the other sixth graders.  She had had a chicken that attracted the attention of Pathe News  because it could walk backwards.  Her chicken was odd, but no one regarded Flannery as being so.  She was recognized as being an individual; no one ever intimated  16  I 	asu06600000260018001							67692372 Bytes	3949	5712	1137394977	RGB	8	600	asu06600000260018001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1052	1052	1053.jp2	/asu0660/image/1053.jp2
Flannery O'Connor as Seen by a Friend					Walston, Rosa Lee																											asu0660000026	that she was peculiar. She lived in the ante-bellum capital of  Georgia in a house built in 1820, but there is no indication that her  life lacked twentieth-century focus. Hence it is startling to hear  Josephone Hendin in The World of Flannery O'Connor saying there  was an unreal and even comic gentility to her upbringing in  Milledgeville that must have given O'Connor a wry sense of her  aloneness as a woman, artist and Southerner who happened to be an  Irish Catholic.  It is doubtful that one who has one of her characters say, "The  trouble with them is they ain't from nowhere" regarded her  upbringing as unreal. A strong sense of place is one of the strengths  of her works.  On occasion Flannery could be as laconic as Coolidge. Instead of  answering a fool according to his folly, she could refrain from comment in a way that spoke volumes. It is perhaps this quality which  has caused some to speak of her as glum and dour.  Flannery was a truly simple person, which is of course a way of  saying that she was very complex but had learned to order her life  so that first things came first. Even in her talents she was multi-  faceted and in the beginning had to choose between her painting  and her writing. The same type of humor evinced in her early cartoons in the college paper abounds in her stories, and something of  her delight in caricature carries over to the well-known self-portrait  with the pheasant.  She hated sham and was particularly restive when confronted  with jargon, though she culled examples with glee. These she dispatched to friends with her characteristically ungrammatical notes.  She cherished the term "fortunate deviates" which a textbook on  exceptional children used to distinguish the gifted child from the  retarded. The pomposity of vocabularies in other fields is often  lightly emphasized in her stories.  Members of the local book club still chuckle over the luncheon  they gave for Flannery when Wise Blood was published in 1952. A  discussion began on the book which had impressed each most in  childhood. Several ladies frankly admit casting about for a title that  should impress the honor guest with their precocity. When Flann-  ery's turn came, she drawled, "The Sears Roebuck catalog."  She was most gracious in her association with the college students and amazingly generous with the time she gave those who  aspired to write, although with the thoughtlessness of the young  they sometimes took an unconscionable amount of her time. It was  at a student group that she replied to the question, "Why do you  write?" with the matter-of-fact statement, "Because I am good at  17  \ 	asu06600000260019001							66607800 Bytes	3885	5713	2782827946	RGB	8	600	asu06600000260019001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1053	1053	1054.jp2	/asu0660/image/1054.jp2
Flannery O'Connor as Seen by a Friend					Walston, Rosa Lee																											asu0660000026	it." Flannery knew precisely what kind of bomb she had dropped.  Without one flicker of an eyelash to help them, she left the students to resolve the paradox of this to them ultimate in conceit with  what they had already come to recognize as her genuine modesty.  At the time that she made this statement she had already won the  O. Henry and best American Short Story awards besides receiving  grants from the Kenyon Review and the Ford Foundation, but she  was not alluding to these. Rather it was a vivid statement of her  conviction that one's talent should not be buried. Neither should  those lacking talent be encouraged. We smile remembering her dictum, "Many a best seller could have been prevented by a good  English teacher."  While she always took her work seriously, she was happily free  from taking herself seriously. The delightful humor was always just  under the surface. When the TV version of "The Life You Save  May Be Your Own" distorted the conclusion beyond recognition,  instead of fulminating against the "boob tube" she wryly observed,  "Well, it gave me the money to buy a second refrigerator."  Her coruscating wit was caustic only when dealing with frauds.  Her backwoods fundamentalists she respects for their integrity. She  can show an illiterate in his ludicrousness without demeaning him.  She was like this in real life. Her gift for comedy never blurred her  humanity.  Visits to Andalusia, her farm home four miles from Milledgeville,  were apt to have a good bit of discussion of the animals. We examined the callus on a swan's foot or went out to see the jackass  presented to Regina on Mother's Day with the card, "For the  Mother who has everything." The best time to arrive was in the late  afternoon when the twenty-eight peacocks strutted most proudly.  Flannery said they always chose unpainted sheds to prance before  as if they realized the effectiveness of contrast. Then in a jeweled  processional they perched on a fence before taking off for mass  roosting in a cedar tree.  But Flannery's was no isolated farm life. Celebrities made a  beaten path to her door. Since she was not a name dropper, I cannot  begin to call the roll. I do remember with great pleasure the time  that Allen Nevins asked if it would be possible to meet her. Always  hospitable, Flannery asked me to bring him out. And for more than  two hours I listened to as exhilarating a discussion of books as it has  ever been my privilege to hear. That afternoon they hit upon Conrad, Trollope and Henry James. With astounding precision they  recalled details, reviewed episodes, pointed out nuances, each  18 	asu06600000260020001							66844988 Bytes	3905	5704	3313397709	RGB	8	600	asu06600000260020001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1054	1054	1055.jp2	/asu0660/image/1055.jp2
Flannery O'Connor as Seen by a Friend					Walston, Rosa Lee																											asu0660000026	showing a quick appreciation for the insight of the other.  She used to say that when asked her favorite author she always  replied Henry James because so few had read him that it immediately stopped the conversation. Of many of her contemporaries she spoke with enthusiasm. Her realization of the way  Faulkner had preempted certain areas was capsuled in the remark,  "Nobody wants his mule and wagon stalled on the same track the  Dixie Limited is roaring down."  But in the steady seriousness with which she took her responsibility of authorship she could say that she was willing to wait a  hundred years if necessary for recognition. Happily that has not  been necessary.  Consider the plight of one of our graduates about to publish her  master's thesis, an annotated bibliography of O'Connor criticism in  1969 with over 300 items; she delayed publication to add 69 items  in 1970; then 1971 brought an outpouring of articles in connection  with the publication of The Complete Stories, ranging from Alfred  Kazin's front page article in the New York Times Book Review to  references in minor newspapers. In 1972 came the National Book  Award for Fiction, even though this accolade required breaking the  rule that the author receiving it must not have been dead over two  years. In this the tenth year since her untimely death at the age of  thirty-nine the stream of commentary shows no signs of diminishing.  All those hundreds of contributions for a woman who wrote only  five books: the two novels, Wise Blood in 1952, The Violent Bear It  Away'm 1960; the two volumes of short stories,^ Good Man Is Hard  to Find in 1955, Everything That Rises Must Converge, the stories  published as a collection a year after her death; and Mystery and  Manners, the collection of her essays and lectures also  posthumously published.  Since I concur in the judgment of so many that her genius found  its best expression in the short story, I beg you to indulge me in  mentioning my favorites. Also I reserve the right to change the list  next week, as many of those omitted nudge the memory  reproachfully. At least I hope that some of my favorites and yours  will be the same. I choose "A Good Man Is Hard to Find," "The  Life You Save May Be Your Own," "The Displaced Person," "A  Temple of the Holy Ghost," "The Lame Shall Enter First,"  "Revelation," "Judgment Day," "Good Country People," "Everything That Rises Must Converge," "Parker's Back" and "The Artificial Nigger.".  19 	asu06600000260021001							65430764 Bytes	3817	5712	2209794919	RGB	8	600	asu06600000260021001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1055	1055	1056.jp2	/asu0660/image/1056.jp2
Flannery O'Connor as Seen by a Friend					Walston, Rosa Lee																											asu0660000026	This last, which Flannery sometimes declared to be her favorite,  merits some consideration because in our current trauma over anything that has to do with race it is in danger of being misunderstood.  The title of course is the pronunciation of the self-righteous backwoodsman, Mr. Head. In this beautifully written —one is tempted to  say flawlessly constructed story —the statue of the Negro serves to  reconcile the grandfather to the grandson whom he has denied  knowing. The few short-sighted who attempt to label O'Connor as  racist should recall the passage on the train where the boy Nelson  sees his first Negro enter the car. When the grandfather asks  "What was that?" the boy replies "A man." "What kind of a  man?" the grandfather persists. "A fat man," the boy replies. Here  you have the report of the "innocent eye" as beautifully handled as  Mark Twain handled Huck's honest unprejudiced reactions. It is  also reminiscent of Shakespeare's magna charta for human dignity,  "Hath not a Jew eyes?"  In this story we also find an exquisite passage showing the grace  which the author said is always offered for the character's redemption in despite of all his non-deserving. After their terrifying day of  being lost in the city the man and the boy have just managed to  catch the train for "home. Safely back in familiar territory,  Mr. Head stood very still and felt the action of mercy touch him again but  this time he knew there were no words in the world that could name it. He  understood that it grew out of agony, which is not denied to any man and  which is given in strange ways to children. He understood it was all a man  could carry into death to give his Maker and he suddenly burned with  shame that he had so little of it to take with him. He stood appalled, judging himself with the thoroughness of God, while the action of mercy  covered his pride like a flame and consumed it. He had never thought  himself a great sinner before but he saw now that his true depravity had  been hidden from him lest it cause him despair. He realized that he was  forgiven for sins from the beginning of time when he had received in his  own heart the sin of Adam, until the present when he had denied poor  Nelson. He saw that no sin was too monstrous for him to claim as his own,  and since God loved in proportion as He forgave, he felt ready at the instant to enter Paradise.  The quoted passage represents one aspect of her writing. Her  constant sense of comedy and her ability to render it in the idiom of  her characters must also be emphasized. Each word falls exactly  into place in the tightly constructed sentences, each of which contributes to the admirable structuring of the stories. No wonder she  was not a prolific author. Writing such as hers is exacting in the demands for painstaking revision.  20 	asu06600000260022001							66860364 Bytes	3895	5720	3216527458	RGB	8	600	asu06600000260022001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1056	1056	1057.jp2	/asu0660/image/1057.jp2
Flannery O'Connor as Seen by a Friend					Walston, Rosa Lee																											asu0660000026	Stuart Burns, who has written perceptively on O'Connor and says  she belongs in the company of Melville, James and Faulkner, mentions four characteristics of her work. First—the use of violence. It  exists not for its own sake but as the shock necessary to bring the  arrogant to the realization of their limitations. Second is the use of  the Christ figure. In unlikely form such as the Misfit or the Displaced Person its function is clearly seen in the moment of self-  knowing. Third is the recurrence of the same character types in a  story to reinforce each other. And, fourth, is a metaphorical quality  whereby imagery and symbolism are made to convey the theme.  These four qualities are placed in the framework of paradox. It is  perhaps the element of paradox which has disturbed a good many  readers. Some years ago in Bangkok a Milledgeville lady came to my  hotel with an eagerly prepared list of questions about her home  town. Leading the list was, "Has Flannery O'Connor written any  more dirty books?" How does one answer such a question —as  loaded as the query, "Have you quit beating your wife?" We might  be more patient with those who raise the objection that her  language is not ladylike, if they themselves had to consult a dictionary to ferret out meaning. It really seems too obvious to explain that  Flannery was not usually writing about ladies.  Still others, resenting her picture of the South, fail to see that she  is not writing about the South. Would that she were, for there would  then be more hope for the human race. The South merely furnishes  a recognizable background to reveal the universal human condition. The artist must necessarily use the local and particular for  detail to be convincing. Instead of accepting as a truism, "You can't  go home again," we must realize that it is the only place the author  can go.  Flannery herself said, "I'm interested in the Old Adam. My  characters talk Southern because I do." Then she added that if she  lived in Japan twenty years and wrote a story about Japanese  characters, they would talk just like Herman Talmadge.  When asked why Southern authors write so much about freaks,  Flannery in characteristic vein replied, "Perhaps because they're  the only people who still recognize them." This of course implies a  norm of values. The grotesque which she used so masterfully represents a distortion of reality to compel us to look at a reality which we  might otherwise take for granted. Her explanation —"To the hard  of hearing we shout."  Flannery's norm of values is orthodox Christianity. Though she  speaks as a Roman Catholic, Protestants who have read Reinhold  21 	asu06600000260023001							65980296 Bytes	3817	5760	4188444537	RGB	8	600	asu06600000260023001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1057	1057	1058.jp2	/asu0660/image/1058.jp2
Flannery O'Connor as Seen by a Friend					Walston, Rosa Lee																											asu0660000026	Niebuhr should find no insurmountable hurdles. Of course the art  oozes out if one fails to distinguish between the theological and the  aesthetic. Most emphatically she is not writing Sunday School tracts.  As she put it, "A story isn't good for much unless it is good for itself."  She thought of the novelist as a prophet—a realist of distances—  and said, "When the writer has finished, there must always be left  over that sense of mystery that cannot be accounted for by any  human formula."  Alfred Kazin has referred to her as "one of the few Catholic writers of fiction who managed to fuse a thorough orthodoxy with the  greatest possible independence and sophistication as an artist."  Always she opposes secularism. "A man with a good car don't  need no justification."  Mrs. May in "Greenleaf" "thought the word Jesus should be  kept inside the church building like other words inside the  bedroom. She was a good Christian woman with a large respect for  religion though she did not of course believe any of it was true." A  point of view echoed by Mrs. Mclntyre in another story, "As far as I  am concerned Christ was just another displaced person."  It has been observed that O'Connor's male characters are God-  intoxicated, her female characters smug. One hears Mrs. Turpin,  "who has a little of everything," saying, "Thank you God for making everything just like it is" and sees the smirk on her fatuous face  as the Negroes murmur "Jesus satisfied with her." But even complacency such as this is purged by the violent confrontation with  reality which leads to a vision of hordes of "white trash and black  niggers" leading the procession into heaven while Mrs. Turpin and  other "respectable" people bring up the rear.  Walter Clemons refers to this as one of the great scenes in American fiction and says that in this story, "Revelation", Flannery  O'Connor "brought everything she had into blazing focus—her  rambunctious comic gift, her mercilessly exact eye and ear, her  compassion, her belief in the mysterious action of divine grace on  the most obstinate clay."  Having mentioned Clemons, Burns and Kazin, I should like also  to recommend the discussions of Robert Fitzgerald, Stanley  Hyman, Robert Drake and Sister Kathleen Fealey. There are  several others equally illuminating but these will do for a starter.  The influences which are found in her work range from Mark  Twain to Sophocles. Bunyan might also be cited in the symbolic  naming of characters and in the basic question of Christian in  22 	asu06600000260024001							68035332 Bytes	3969	5712	1539784046	RGB	8	600	asu06600000260024001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1058	1058	1059.jp2	/asu0660/image/1059.jp2
Flannery O'Connor as Seen by a Friend					Walston, Rosa Lee																											asu0660000026	Pilgrim's Progress as he cries out, "What shall I do to be saved? " In a  sense that is what all literature is about. We read to understand  others of course, but above all we read to find ourselves. (Only  when TV is substituted for reading do we get an "identity crisis.")  Like Keats, Flannery regarded this world as a "vale for soul making." She was remarkably consistent in her point of view. She could  dispose of permissiveness in general by commenting upon allowing  students to make a cafeteria of the curriculum by querying, "Are we  to ask if it pleases them that French verbs should be irregular?"  The sterility of much of our current sociology and psychology is  brought out in many stories. Rayber in The Violent Bear It Away  wanted to give young Tarwater every advantage. Old Tarwater  gloats, "You've got me to thank for saving you from those advantages." His success in so doing may be gauged by the boy's response  to Rayber's comment, "The airplane is man's greatest engineering  feat." He summarily disposes of the achievement with, "A buzzard  can fly."  I began this talk by breathing anathema upon the irrelevancy of  much biography. In Flannery's case one biographical fact has been  interpreted in a way which I find downright misleading. She knew  that she had the same dread disease of lupus from which her father  had died at the age of forty. She had no illusion about the brevity of  her life span.  Alfred Kazin, reflecting on the consistency and severity of the  style by which she sees, wonders as to its personal source. He then  mentions the lupus and reports that someone who knew her well  told him that her point of view was based on unadmissible rage  against her physical limitations.  With all due respect to Mr. Kazin's unnamed informant, I say  most emphatically that his interpretation in no way fits the Flannery O'Connor that I knew. Surely her religion which gave her absolute values is a more adequate explanation of her point of view,  even though we, largely engulfed by a permissive and secular  society, may overlook so obvious an explanation.  She would, I believe, have written as she did had she been sure of  the allotted three score years and ten. Her point of view was  unaltered by circumstance. The lupus she seemed to regard as  "mere event" in the best Spinozistic sense. Having viewed her illness sub specie aeternitatis she turned to the important thing of getting her writing done. Her disease put her on crutches. Right there  its effect stopped. Her spirit was untouched. No shadow of crutches  falls on her writing.  23 	asu06600000260025001							65202232 Bytes	3809	5704	1466127450	RGB	8	600	asu06600000260025001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1059	1059	1060.jp2	/asu0660/image/1060.jp2
Flannery O'Connor as Seen by a Friend					Walston, Rosa Lee																											asu0660000026	Whatever the sound of "time's winged chariot drawing near"  may have been in her private ear, it made no discordancy in the artist's purpose or achievement. Certainly I do not wish to pose as one  who had "plucked the heart out of her mystery." For all of us I  suspect that Flannery was like the iceberg in exposing but one-  ninth of itself. That part which we were privileged to know was  gallant and gay and unassuming. In the rich legacy of her works we  must probe to understand the genius that made them and her possible.  All over the country she is discussed and admired by college students. Frequently they write or phone me. Sometimes I suspect that  it is a painless way of writing their term papers. More frequently  they evince both interest and bafflement. When they worry about  not being quite sure of her meaning, I repeat the advice which  Heminge and Condell gave the readers of the First Folio of  Shakespeare. "Read him again and again. And if then you do not  like him, surely you are in some manifest danger not to understand  him."

Margaret Spicer-Simson: Some Recollections					Montesquiou-Fezensac, Blaise, comtesse de.																											asu0660000026	Margaret Spicer-Simson:  Some Recollections  By Comtesse Blaise de Montesquiou-Fezensac  On the southern edge of France's Fontainebleau forest, some forty miles from Paris,  lies the quiet village of Bourron. It was here that the medallist Theodore Spicer-Simson and his wife Margaret lived for fifteen years prior to their removal to Coconut  Grove, Florida, in 1947. Their house, whimsically named "Les Volets Verts," was  not far from the chateau of Count and Countess Blaise de Montesquiou-Fezensac.  An enduring friendship developed between the two families. In a letter recently  received by Marjory Stoneman Douglas the Countess recalls her association with the  Spicer-Simsons and in particular her fond remembrance of Margaret.  The Countess's letter in beautiful French was translated by Dr. Leonard Muller  and his wife Barbara into equally beautiful English for this issue of THE CARRELL.  The Mullers were married at "Les Volets Verts". Barbara's father, David Fairchild,  and Theodore Spicer-Simson were close friends for almost fifty-five years.  Commemorative tribute to Theodore Spicer-Simson appears in the 1971 issues of  THE CARRELL. Editor's Note  Bourron, France  September 1973  Some recollections about Mrs. Spicer-Simson during the War  1939.1944  In the first months of the war, Mr. and Mrs. Spicer-Simson were  made prisoners by the German who came to arrest them at Les  Volets Verts. They were taken to Paris where it was found that Mrs.  Spicer-Simson was an American; so, the next day, she was allowed  to return to Bourron, very upset because her husband had been detained and sent to a prision camp in Bezancon. There, he was interned, with other prisoners, in barracks filthy and infested with  bedbugs. Luckily his stay was not very long: some weeks, I believe  (or some months?), and then, in view of his age, he was sent back  to Bourron, his health badly impaired . . .  Mr. and Mrs. Spicer-Simson benefited from the parcels sent at  regular intervals by Americans to their nationals in France, and  these they shared generously with their neighbors and friends, with  unending kindness.

She  also gave chocolate to the children. She made soups that she would  take to an unfortunate elderly neighbor or to young people she  knew to be underfed. That she was loved in her neighborhood  became evident when she left for America, she was very much  missed, and memories of her have not faded.  She took complete care of her garden, which gave her a lot of  work. She had beautiful fruit, thanks to the care she gave to her  trees; she made as much jam as she could, using "war recipes" in  which she showed great ingenuity, and she also gave these jams to  all those around her. She preserved vegetables. She had a few  chickens and therefore eggs, which she also shared with her neighbors . . .  She owned two goats that she brought every day through the park  of the chateau; they cropped the grass and browsed on branches  and bushes; thus she had milk for herself and her husband and she  often made little cheeses which she gave to one or the other when  there were enough to go around. She was very fond of animals—she  took in sick cats to care for. She had a pigeon (or a hen, I cannot  remember) that was quite tame and which walked around in the  house and around the table at meal times. There was also their black  dog "Bonty" who held a prominent place in the household!  Les Volets Verts was admirably appointed, in excellent taste, by  Mrs. Spicer-Simson and one felt immediately at ease. She knew how  to display her husband's work to its best advantage; harmony  reigned in the house, and in the garden; there was her handsome  portrait over the mantel . . .  She was always ready to comfort you "with a nice cup of tea"  when you dropped in on her tired, or worried!  Mrs. Spicer-Simson was simplicity and humility personified: she  never spoke about herself, and no one would ever have suspected  that she was a talented miniaturist! Her life was entirely devoted to  her husband and his work, she had for him a veritable cult, and she  cared for him with matchless devotion, always smiling, always  cheerful. She knew how to comfort others, although her own life  was not always easy.  Her conversation was always interesting, lively, often full of  humor. She lent us English or American books, which are now in  our library. She had become for us a real friend and her departure  from France affected us deeply. Even today, I cannot pass in front  of Les Volets Verts without a pang.  26 	asu06600000260028001							67231544 Bytes	3944	5680	3657900365	RGB	8	600	asu06600000260028001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1062	1062	1063.jp2	/asu0660/image/1063.jp2

Library Cooperation in the Caribbean					McNeal, Archie L.																											asu0660000026	Library Cooperation  in the Caribbean  By Archie L. McNeal  Since its founding, the University of Miami has felt a responsibility and recognized an opportunity to function as an international university. By virtue of geographic location and with  the development of modern transportation, Miami has become one  of the focal points for travel to and from Latin America and  especially the Caribbean.  It is only natural that universities in developing areas and those  in more established areas should find mutual interests, and equally  so that their libraries undertake cooperative endeavors. In July  1968, pursuant to a request from Sir Philip Sherlock, Dr. Alma Jordan (Deputy Librarian, University of the West Indies, Trinidad)  visited a number of libraries in the interest of establishing a consortium for the purpose of collaboration in a number of cooperative  programs such as acquisitions, bibliographic projects, microfilming  projects, publications, etc.  Those visited included the following: The University of Florida  Library, Gainesville; The University of Miami Library, Coral Gables, Florida; The University of Puerto Rico Library, San Juan; The  New York Public Library; The Columbus Memorial Library (Pan  American Union), Washington, D.C.; and The Caribbean Regional  Library, San Juan. Dr. Jordan reported that all the librarians were  "most receptive to the general idea." Her report of September 18,  1968 to Sir Philip outlined in some detail possible procedures and  methods of organizing and funding such a program.  In November 1968 the Association of Caribbean Universities  and Research Institutes became a reality as the result of efforts by  Sir Philip Sherlock, then Vice-Chancellor of the University of the  West Indies. (He is now Secretary General of the Association which  is known as UNICA). At their conference in Puerto Rico in 1968, a  paper on library cooperation was among those presented.  Following this presentation, it was agreed that the time was appropriate to organize the Association of Caribbean University and  Research Libraries. It was decided to hold the initial meeting in San  Juan, Puerto Rico from June 14 to June 16, 1969 which would be  just before the annual meeting of SALALM (an organization  28 	asu06600000260030001							67140712 Bytes	3912	5719	4092363069	RGB	8	600	asu06600000260030001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1064	1064	1065.jp2	/asu0660/image/1065.jp2

Preliminary arrangements were made by a committee which included Dr. Jordan; Miss Luisa Vigo-Cepeda, Librarian, Institute of  Caribbean Studies, Puerto Rico; Dr. Albertina Perez de Rosa,  Librarian, Latin American Studies, University of Puerto Rico; and  Mrs. Shirley Barrow, Assistant Librarian, University of the West Indies, Mona, Jamaica.  The conference was successful, with more than forty delegates  attending. A Working Party on Formation of ACURIL was established and included Dr. Alma Jordan, Chairman; Mr. William  Gocking (University of the West Indies, Jamaica); Dr. Archie  McNeal (University of Miami); Miss Luisa Vigo-Cepeda (Puerto  Rico); Dr. G. A. Harrer (University of Florida); Sister Nora Hillery,  (Catholic Univ., Ponce, Puerto Rico); Lie. Ario Garza Mercado  (Mexico); and Mrs. Yvonne Stephenson (Guyana).  The Working Party met Monday, June 19th, 1969 and twice  thereafter, establishing the basis for the organization and making  recommendations to serve as a guide in drafting a constitution.  The Aims and Objectives were stated as follows: "The purposes  of the Association shall be to facilitate the development and use of  libraries and the identification of library collections in support of  the whole range of intellectual endeavor in universities and  research institutes throughout the Caribbean area, to further the  profession of librarianship in the region, and to promote cooperative library activities in pursuit of these objectives."  The "Caribbean area" is defined as "the Caribbean Archipelago  and those mainland countries which border on the Caribbean Sea  and Gulf of Mexico, and in addition the Guyanas and Surinam."  The decision was also made that membership would be on an institutional basis. Provision was made for Associate membership for  universities and research libraries outside the Caribbean area.  The Working Party served as the Nominating Committee and  Alma Jordan was the unanimous choice for President of ACURIL.  Other nominations were as follows:  Dra. Albertina Perez de Rosa for Vice-President  Miss Luisa Vigo-Cepeda for Secretary/Treasurer  Mr. Thomas Kabdebo - Executive Council  Mr. Ken Ingram - Executive Council  Dr. G. A. Harrer - Executive Council  Lie.

Library Cooperation in the Caribbean					McNeal, Archie L.																											asu0660000026	Srta. Rosa Elena Despradel - Executive Council  Miss Enid Baa - Executive Council  Out of this first conference came a number of resolutions which  are indicative of the direction in which members felt ACURIL  should move:  Acquisitions: That ACURIL urge and pursue the enactment and/or enforcement of appropriate copyright and legal deposit legislation in each  territory throughout the region so as to ensure regular and comprehensive  collection of the local publications of each such territory.  Bibliography: That in countries or areas without a current National  Bibliography the public library or another library with major responsibility  for acquiring local publications should be encouraged to prepare regular  acquisition lists to be circulated to ACURIL members.  Personnel: That ACURIL promote a survey of library manpower needs in  the Caribbean area with special reference to the region's university and  research institute libraries. . .  That the University of the West Indies be urged to establish a library  school at the earliest possible date.  These are only a few resolutions selected from the thirty-one presented.  Subsequently, as the organization developed under the leadership  of Dr. Jordan, committees were established in many of the areas to  which the resolutions directed attention. Acquisitions, Bibliography, Personnel, Indexing, Publications and Promotion, Constitution and By-Laws are those presently working. Through the efforts  of these committees, much has been accomplished, but much remains to be done.  The Second Conference of ACURIL was held in Barbados  November 22-27, 1970. The papers of that conference, as well as  those of the First Conference have been published by the American Library Association under the title "Research Library Cooperation in the Caribbean." These were edited by Alma Jordan and  have provided some of the information included here.  The scope of ACURIL expanded to include institutional members from Venezuela and Colombia, so it was natural for the Third  Conference to be held in Caracas. Concern with Agriculture and  Medicine appear in the resolutions from this conference.  The Fourth Conference was held in San Juan, Puerto Rico and  produced some excellent papers on personnel matters. Of particular  significance was the paper by Dr. Frederick E. Kidder, Director of  30 	asu06600000260032001							67412664 Bytes	3932	5713	3505594017	RGB	8	600	asu06600000260032001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1066	1066	1067.jp2	/asu0660/image/1067.jp2

It is expected that the papers of the Third and Fourth Conferences may soon be available in printed form, and ultimately,  those of later conferences.  The Fifth Conference was held in Miami October 21-27, 1973.  The theme of this conference was "The Role of the Library in the  Development of Countries."  There are now 87 institutional members from 20 different countries. At the more recent conferences it has been possible to provide  simultaneous translation which has been of great benefit to participants.  Presently plans are well under way for the Sixth Annual Conference of ACURIL in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands. The program  follows the theme of "Centralization in Academic and Research  Libraries." Papers will be presented by representatives from  Florida, Puerto Rico, Trinidad, Venezuela, and Colombia.  There is every indication that the Association of Caribbean and  Research Libraries is moving toward its goal of cooperation on a  broad front, and that its members are united in a common cause  with complete dedication. Acceptance for membership in IFLA  (International Federation of Library Associations) is further evidence of recognition.  ACURIL's Newsletter has provided communication to members,  in English and in Spanish, with regard to current activities and program. This is a product of the Committee on Publications and Promotion under the direction of Albertina Perez de Rosa. The most  recent issue was volume I, number 3 for April, 1974.  We look forward to sound achievement through continued  cooperative effort in ACURIL.  Editor's Note: Dr. Archie L.

The Crow and the Peacock					Perry, Ronald, 1932-																											asu0660000037	THE  CARRELL  Volume 25 1987  Three tales from the Laotian by Ronald Perry  The Crow and the Peacock  A very long time ago, in the days of the world's youth, the crow  was a white bird, who could hide himself without difficulty in the middle of a cloud, or in the snowy woods on the slopes of the mountains  where he had his home; and the peacock was as black as soot all over,  from beak to tail-feathers.  At this time, these two birds were such good friends that one would  hardly ever be seen without the other.  One day, in the middle of a particularly green summer, the two  friends decided that the time had come for them to see something of  the world outside their own forest on the slopes of the mountains, and  so they set off together towards the jungles of rain that lay to the south.  After a time, they came to a part of the southern jungle where the  fire-trees were all in blossom. For some hours the friends walked under  these strange trees, with the petals falling all around them like showers  of soft fire. Then, after their eyes had grown accustomed to the blaze  and dazzle of color, they saw, sitting in the trees above them, the  paradise birds who have always sat among such flowers, disdainfully  preening their jeweled feathers and taking no notice of any lesser  creatures.  As soon as they saw these birds, the crow and the peacock looked  at one another, and immediately decided that they were greatly bored  with their own drab costumes, and that it was time for them to alter  their appearance. For why, they said, should two such wise and clever  birds as themselves be attired any less spectacularly than these other  birds, who were obviously very foolish, since they could do nothing  all day long but sit in these burning trees admiring themselves and pretending they were flowers?  1 	asu06600000370003001							66301936 Bytes	3867	5713	738968275	RGB	8	600	asu06600000370003001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1074	1074	1075.jp2	/asu0660/image/1075.jp2
The Crow and the Peacock					Perry, Ronald, 1932-																											asu0660000037	As soon as they had returned to their own forest in the mountains,  therefore, the crow and the peacock mixed for themselves an assortment of colors: blue from the seed of the wild poppy, scarlet from the  ferntree's root, yellow from crushed almond blossoms, white from the  limestone lake: and began to work.  Since painting the peacock would take longer, they decided to start  with him, and leave the crow's new attire until the last.  Although he worked slowly at first, it wasn't very long before the  crow had developed a considerable skill in applying the colors to his  friend's feathers. With many flourishes, he drew circles of varying sizes  and filled them with deep blue and glowing purple, primrose and scarlet.  When he got to the tail, he made a thousand marvelous jeweled eyes  under soft lashes. He placed a crown of hyacinth and green and fresh  gold on the peacock's head, and did not stop until his friend surely  had the most beautiful plumage of any bird in the world.  Then, in his turn, the peacock took up the brush. First, he applied  a coat of deep velvet black all over, as a ground which would set off  the colors to their best advantage. Just as the peacock was about to  put on the first touches of color, however, the crow looked up and saw,  not very far off, a company of vultures circling and planing and swooping down on some carrion prey they had discovered.  At this, the crow became very excited, and hopped up and down  in his eagerness to participate in the vultures' feast. He hopped up and  down so much that the peacock was unable to work, and finally, unable  to restrain his appetite any longer, the crow said to his friend that he  really did not think after all that a coat of many colors would suit him,  and that he was more than content with his new black attire. Then he  flew off in a great hurry to join the vultures.  And that, of course, is how the crow became black, and the peacock  many-colored. 	asu06600000370004001							66291760 Bytes	3870	5708	2816696354	RGB	8	600	asu06600000370004001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1075	1075	1076.jp2	/asu0660/image/1076.jp2

The Star					Perry, Ronald, 1932-																											asu0660000037	The Star  One summer, not very long ago, three friends were travelling  together through the forests of rain that cover the lands to the south  like a blanket. Each morning, before starting out, they would carefully  plan the day's journey, in order to arrive at another village or habitation before nightfall, and thereby avoid having to spend a night in the  forest.  One day, however, they were delayed for some time trying to find  a way across a river in flood, and so they were still deep in the forest,  far from their destination, when the darkness fell, very suddenly, as  it does in those regions, dropping through the thick leaves and vines  like black rain.  At this, the three friends were very frightened. Huddled together  under the cold stars in a small clearing just outside the circle of impenetrable shadow that lay under the trees, they argued for a long time  as to the best way to dispose themselves for sleep so as to avoid the  risk of being devoured by the wild animals that walk abroad in the dark,  or of being attacked by the thieves and brigands who also walk there,  and who are said to be even more terrible than the most ferocious of  the other animals.  As they argued, each of the three kept trying to secure for himself  the middle position between the other two, in order to be less exposed  to the nameless horrors that prowled and padded silently in the shadows  all around them.  Finally, one of them, looking up at the stars winking in the black  sky above them, hit upon a solution with which they could all agree.  "Let us sleep together in the shape of a star," he said, "with our  heads in the center, and our heels outside; for in this way none of us  will be more exposed to danger than any other."  Some time later, after they had disposed themselves in this fashion  and fallen asleep, an elephant came out of the shadows into the clearing. When the elephant saw the three friends lying asleep in the starlight,  he was greatly astonished, and went off immediately to tell his friend  the monkey what he had seen.  "I have just seen something very extraordinary and slightly alarming," the elephant said, still a little breathless from hurrying. "It was  lying in the middle of a small clearing, and although it did not move  I could see that it was alive, for it was breathing. It had three heads  in the middle of its body, and six feet equidistant from each other.  Needless to say, I did not go very close to it, but came immediately  to tell you." 	asu06600000370006001							67056956 Bytes	3901	5728	2647139137	RGB	8	600	asu06600000370006001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1077	1077	1078.jp2	/asu0660/image/1078.jp2
The Star					Perry, Ronald, 1932-																											asu0660000037	When he heard this strange tale, the monkey was very skeptical,  and accused his friend of having drunk too much rice-wine; for who,  he said, had ever heard of such a creature as this?  The elephant was naturally indignant at the monkey's reply, and  said, "I'm not accustomed to being doubted in this fashion. You know  perfectly well that I never drink more rice-wine than I should, and that,  of all your friends, I am by far the most truthful and reliable. If you  do not believe me, come and look for yourself."  Although the monkey was still far from convinced, he nevertheless  agreed to go with the elephant to the place where he claimed to have  seen this peculiar and unlikely creature.  When they were near the clearing, the elephant cautioned the  monkey, who was riding on his shoulder and indulging in sly jokes at  his friend's expense, to be very quiet so as not to arouse the strange  beast which was apparently sleeping out there in the open; for who knew  what terrible powers such a creature might possess?  Although the monkey was amused at the elephant's timidity and  caution, nevertheless he kept quiet, and peered through the flickering  shadows ahead of them as they approached the edge of the clearing,  trying to see what it could be that had disturbed his friend so severely.  When they came out from under the trees and the elephant stopped, just inside the ring of starlight that now blazed across the clearing, the monkey clambered up onto his friend's head and looked down  at the strange apparition, and held on tightly to the elephant's ear,  trembling a little.  At first, he was too surprised to speak, but after a moment, when  he had recovered, he leaned down and whispered in his friend's ear,  "Truly, it is very extraordinary indeed, and I have misjudged you. But  what can it be? It is obviously not as large or powerful as yourself,  but on the other hand it may have as many teeth as a tiger, or magic  powers we do not know of; or it may even be that it is poisonous to  touch, like some flowers. ..."  At this moment, one of the three travelers groaned a little, and  turned in his sleep, which made the elephant jump nervously, and which  so terrified the monkey that he shrieked and fell back. Losing his grip  on the elephant's ear, he fell to the ground, and ran away on all four  limbs into the forest, crying, "Help! Save us! Save us! A living star  has fallen down out of the sky and will surely devour us! Help!"  When they heard the monkey's screeching and frantic cries, all the  wild birds and beasts of the forest also became alarmed, and started  running after him as quickly as they could, their fright increasing with  each step they took.  But the three travelers, who were all very sound sleepers, heard 	asu06600000370007001							66730168 Bytes	3884	5725	3723055330	RGB	8	600	asu06600000370007001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1078	1078	1079.jp2	/asu0660/image/1079.jp2

Dame Crow And Mr Worm					Perry, Ronald, 1932-																											asu0660000037	Dame Crow And Mr Worm  A very long time ago, when the world was greener than it is now,  crows fed on figs and wild mulberries and such, and had no thought  of eating worms, who in those days lived quite happily on top of the  ground.  Then, one day, as a certain Dame Crow was about to eat a particularly juicy fig, a worm suddenly popped his head out of the side of  the fruit and bowed quite politely to her.  "Dame Crow," said the worm , "I know I am not to your taste,  but nevertheless I will be happy to do you the favor of letting you eat  me together with this dull fig (whose flavor, believe me, will be greatly  improved thereby)—provided you answer correctly one of two questions which I will put to you."  Dame Crow, although she was not in the least interested in eating  Mr. Worm and so spoiling her meal, was delighted with this show of  intelligence and wit, and decided to play along with his game.  "Although you certainly do not appeal to my taste, Mr. Worm,"  she said, "because I find your remarks rather amusing, I will play along  with your game. Pray continue, therefore, and I will answer your questions to the best of my ability."  "Very well," said Mr. Worm. "But please pay close attention, for  both my life and your supper depend on it." Then, taking a rather  oratorical pose, half in and half out of the fig, Mr. Worm put his first  question:  "Sharper than anything sharp," he said, "—what is it?"  Dame Crow thought for a moment, and chucked herself absently  under the beak with the tip of one wing. Then: "Of course!" she said.  "It can only be a thorn ... or a needle ... or perhaps an arrow?"  "You are only allowed one answer," said Mr. Worm. "But yet I  can tell you that none of those is correct. However, you still have  another chance to improve your diet. Think carefully now, and do not  be too hasty with your answer.  "With us once only, then gone in an instant—what is it?"  "Oh, but I don't require any time to think about that!" cried Dame  Crow. "It's obviously the false cottonweed's down!"  "Wrong again," said Mr. Worm. "You disappoint me, Madam,  and certainly you have disappointed your palate very cruelly, for you  cannot eat me now, on your word, poor creature!" And, with this,  Mr. Worm climbed sedately out of the fig and proceeded on his way  down to the ground.

As she sat there  on her limb her eyes got redder and redder, and even her tail feathers  puffed up with indignation. Finally, just as Mr. Worm reached the  ground, she could control herself no longer. With an inarticulate  squawk, she flew down and seized Mr. Worm in one claw, and waggled her beak at him, and said, "Enough of this nonsense! You're as  crooked as you are long. Do you think I stepped out of the egg only  this morning? I don't care how dreadful you taste. I think I will shut  my eyes and devour you anyway, to teach you some manners if nothing  else."  "Stop!" cried Mr. Worm. "Will you prove yourself dishonest after  all? Let us take our dispute to some neutral scholar and settle this argument amicably."  When she heard this, Dame Crow was somewhat abashed, and ruffled her wing feathers uncomfortably, for the crows had always had  the reputation of being honest, and her family would certainly not  appreciate her indicating otherwise.  "All right," she said at last. "But let us go and find a suitable  scholar immediately, for neither of us is getting any younger."  So, with Mr. Worm held tightly in one claw, Dame Crow flew off  to the edge of the forest, where they found a learned doctor walking  for his health just under the trees. When he had heard their story, the  learned doctor said to Mr. Worm, "And what, pray, are your answers  to these riddles?"  "They are exceedingly simple," said Mr. Worm, "and I am only  sorry that Dame Crow could not answer them correctly, for the poor  soul's diet could certainly do with improvement."  "That is as it may be," said the learned doctor, "But please remember that your answers must satisfy me, as a purely neutral party,  or her diet may be altered after all."  "I understand perfectly," said Mr. Worm. "Listen, therefore, and  judge for yourself:  "Sharper than anything sharp—why, that is our wit, for what in  this world cuts deeper?"  "Well said," said the scholar. "And the other?"  "As for the other," said Mr. Worm—"With us once only, and gone  in an instant: what can this be but our innocence, for how long do any  of us remain without knowledge of sin?"  Turning to Dame Crow, the learned doctor said, "Truly, though  he is only a worm, he has got the better of you, Dame Crow. On your  honor, which is also the honor of your family, you may not eat him  now." 	asu06600000370011001							66203864 Bytes	3852	5727	2401307470	RGB	8	600	asu06600000370011001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1082	1082	1083.jp2	/asu0660/image/1083.jp2

The city courts.)  Dropshots are the hardest, to judge  for clearance, and return. We accept  each shot by mutual consent,  our confirmations following  the ball by a split-second. We allow  even for the small dip  like a caesura in the middle,  and where the net would rise  marginally at the alleys,  but of course our guesses are at best  approximate. As one might expect,  our strokes go higher and deeper,  we take fewer chances  with breathtaking skimmers inches  above the tape. Because there's more  to verify, more unseen catches  to watch for, it's probably  a harder game than the one  we're used to. The basic idea  is easy, it relies on only  our natural talent for keeping  barriers between us, and depends  mainly on those being  roughly the same height,  and keeping ourselves honest.  20 	asu06600000370021001							67940088 Bytes	3958	5720	3340908161	RGB	8	600	asu06600000370021001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1092	1092	1093.jp2	/asu0660/image/1093.jp2

Then word  got out to the news boys,  and TV cameras  swept down to interview  the man and his neighbors.  Enterprising nephews  held forth on how Uncle  rubbed his eyes with belief  and the leaf and the stem  of the holy seagrape,  and a dispute rose up  over which seagrape was  indeed the one. Now cures  began to bloom like weeds  in the block's sandy soil,  and it came in a dream  to the citizen whose  property held the tree,  what its true blessing was.  Next morning, he set up  a table offering  seagrape branches for sale,  his relatives carving  miniature replicas  by the hour. Thank goodness  for the miniature trade,  because by noon that day  he had, like the old man  before him, been stricken  with another blindness,  as nothing could be seen 2i  where the seagrape had been. 	asu06600000370022001							66624176 Bytes	3855	5759	3951681465	RGB	8	600	asu06600000370022001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1093	1093	1094.jp2	/asu0660/image/1094.jp2

Something old there is and grim  Compounded of the night when nothing was,  That calls us with a voice of rain  Guttering the ground we have come from,  And it will pull us from the stars  To grind our bodies with the crudest stones.  22  The Poets Dream of Frank,  His Great-Uncle  I rode among the shapes of giant men  Who knew me, though I knew them not, farmers  Holding in gnarled hands pitchfork and scythe,  The ancient Wilburs come to claim their own.  And at their head, on a mare, rode Frank.  We had just passed the graveyard when we stopped.  A horse stamped. Frank said, "I'm going home."  And everywhere a perfumed silence hung  With dew upon each leaf of crowding corn,  Each apple, pear and pendulous wild grape,  For it was June and the earth burgeoning.  The land in shadows lay beneath the moon  And stars were twisted in bright braids of light. 	asu06600000370023001							67740488 Bytes	3936	5735	2112534415	RGB	8	600	asu06600000370023001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1094	1094	1095.jp2	/asu0660/image/1095.jp2
Port Meadow / Great Barrington - November					Rogers, David																											asu0660000037	Port Meadow  Better than any beach Port Meadow is,  With buttercups crowding to the river's edge  And sunbrowned boys, at home in grass or water,  Mortal gods of the bright and perishing day  Flashing like fish in a steady stream of sun,  Too quick for Zeus to catch or Homer sing,  And O, the slow and steady cows love them,  And the horses cantering over the buttercups,  And killies were born for the nets they catch them in,  Quivering in the uncomfortable air.  I too have looked upon these careless gods  And loved them as the river and the sun,  But having fallen to the merely mortal,  Glory again in their glimpse and going.  Great Barrington — November  Here could be no ordinary joy,  Roughed as we are with wood, and what wood,  Deer at the door eating hollyhocks,  Dawn a spilling of molten buttery sun  Down the dark hills, over the uncut corn,  Land in league with sky, loam with light,  And yet there are grey days enough when my bones ache  And the arthritic hand must be whacked to work.  Here there is no ordinary joy,  Only catfrolic under the cold bright moon,  The moon cold and bright in bare branches, the cats  Cavorting in catshadow on the leafless lawn,  And later settling in after a good lick,  Head beside head, tailtip yet unstill,  Yellow eyes embering to a slant slit,  The great purrfurnace banked for a long night,  And pale cold moonlight cold on the sleeping earth.  23 	asu06600000370024001							67510608 Bytes	3880	5798	282836904	RGB	8	600	asu06600000370024001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1095	1095	1096.jp2	/asu0660/image/1096.jp2

Is it possible to escape one's skin,  to leave through the tissue of sun  like EI Greco's Toledo,  like the grass in the foreground  of his great canvas,  flying up like flames, like the yellow hair  of buried angels,  rising out of the ground  to distant hosannas?  Is it possible to be one with the air,  wearing pantaloons  as wide as the hills or a skirt  that trails cathedrals?

But when the melancholy fit shall fall  Sudden from heaven like a weeping cloud,  That fosters the droop-headed flowers all,  And hides the green hill in an April shroud;  Then glut thy sorrow on a morning rose,  Or on the rainbow of the salt sand-wave,  Or on the wealth of globed peonies;  Or if thy mistress some rich anger shows,  Emprison her soft hand, and let her rave,  And feed deep, deep upon her peerless eyes.  She dwells with Beauty—Beauty that must die;  And Joy, whose hand is ever at his lips  Bidding adieu; and aching Pleasure nigh,  Turning to poison while the bee-mouth sips:  Ay, in the very temple of Delight  Veil'd Melancholy has her sovran shrine,  Though seen of none save him whose strenuous tongue  Can burst Joy's grape against his palate fine;  His soul shall taste the sadness of her might,  And be among her cloudy trophies hung.  28 	asu06600000370029001							69022916 Bytes	3998	5753	4226639102	RGB	8	600	asu06600000370029001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1100	1100	1101.jp2	/asu0660/image/1101.jp2
Pharmacy in Keats's Ode on Melancholy					De Almeida, Hermione, 1950-																											asu0660000037	Hermione de Almeida  Pharmacy in Keats's  Ode on Melancholy  John Keats (1795 -1821) was the youngest of the six major English  Romantic poets. Among Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, and  Shelley, Keats was also perhaps the least educated, for his traditional  schooling ended before his fifteenth birthday. In 1810, Keats left  Clarke's School in Enfield to begin his apprenticeship to a surgeon and  physician in London; the next six years, which included a year's residency at Guy's Hospital, London, were spent acquiring the knowledge  necessary to be a licensed apothecary and country physician in England.  Hence it was as a fully qualified general practitioner of medicine that  Keats, in 1817, resolved to try his hand at poetry. Romantic intellectuals considered medicine to be the foremost humanistic discipline; the  history of science, meanwhile, has marked the early nineteenth century as the dawn of modern medicine, as a period when the discipline  first knew the fruits of clinical observation, medical semiotics, practical chemistry, pathology, and cellular theory. The knowledge that  Keats gleaned from his six-year study of medicine in London proved  fair substitute for his truncated formal education; indeed, it probably  surpassed it in its breadth and pertinence to the human condition. The  importance of this knowledge to Keats's maturity as a poet, and to the  very counters of his poetry and its aesthetic theory, is incalculable. In  example, I shall read the medical and pharmacological substance that  underlies and subsumes the metaphorical truth of Keats's well-known  poem, the Ode on Melancholy.  The god of poetry, music and medicine was also, as Keats well knew  from his invocation of Apollo in The Fall of Hyperion, the god of  organic poisons and "misty pestilence."1 Apollo's laurel wreath bore  fragrant leaves that induced foaming oracular frenzy in the Pythian  priestesses at Delphi because they contained, as Keats also knew, prussic  acid or bitter almond, a potent hallucinogenic poison well-known in  the early nineteenth century for its subtlety and rapidity of action. The  Greek pharmakon has always expressed the duality of its first employer,  Apollo: it means 'medicinal drug' and 'tincturing, tainting poison'. The  Latin derivation of 'poison', potio orpotionem, means simply and am-  29 	asu06600000370030001							66019936 Bytes	3869	5686	2473152936	RGB	8	600	asu06600000370030001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1101	1101	1102.jp2	/asu0660/image/1102.jp2
Pharmacy in Keats's Ode on Melancholy					De Almeida, Hermione, 1950-																											asu0660000037	biguously 'a drink'. Over the ages, with the evolution of medical and  literary tradition, and always reflecting back to the original pharmakeus,  Apollo, the concept of the potion-poison has compounded its connotations: as Shakespearean mickle, "the powerful grace that lies / In herbs,  plants, stones," as the medieval elixir, the philosopher's stone, as the  timeless secret recipe —the nostrum, the bewitching venin or venenum  of Venus, the charm of the witch, the talisman of the sorcerer, the  honeyed bitter pill, the seemingly innocuous panacea, the blistering  plaster, the soothing ointment, the perfumed philtre, and even the dye  the apothecary employed to tincture transforming substance.  Potions, benign or malignant, tangible or intangible, are a recurring image in Keats's poetry. Knowledge of her brothers' crimes comes  to Isabella "like a fierce potion, drunk by chance" (267); "Knowledge  enormous" like "some blithe wine / Or bright elixir peerless" makes  a god of Apollo in Hyperion, even as Fate pours "A disanointing  poison" of "mortal oil" upon the heads of the Titans (III, 113, 118-19;  II, 97-8); in Endymion Peona speaks words that medicine away the curse  of melancholy, Cupid is hailed as a "delicious poisoner" with a  "venom'd goblet," and Circe bears a far more venomous "black dull-  gurgling phial" (III, 987-88; III, 515); la belle dame sans merci, in her  poem, feeds her victims malignant "roots of relish sweet" (25); Por-  phyro in The Eve of St. Agnes calls for a "drowsy Morphean amulet"  to assist the dubious, dream-like "Solution sweet" he has in mind for  Madeline (257, 322); the poet of The Fall of Hyperion, meanwhile,  drinks a "domineering potion" which, more potent than any "Asian  poppy" or "elixir fine," brings at once life and death, sorrow and  knowledge, bound together in the conscious intensity of a waking dream  (I, 47-54).  These variegated evocations of healing and toxic potions owe much  to the Keatsian concepts of poetic passivity, negative capability, and  creation induced by the suspended mind or willed indolence; they also  belong with the widespread interest in poisons among the physicians  and pharmacologists of the early nineteenth century. The first comprehensive, systematized study of toxicology, by M. P. Orfila, was  published in 1813; the English translation appeared in 1815—the year  Keats was "walking" the wards at Guy's Hospital—and was widely  reviewed in the literary and scientific journals of London and Edinburgh. Had Keats not encountered Orfila directly, which is unlikely,  current ideas on toxicology were nevertheless available to him through  the English physiologists who taught and lectured at the London  hospitals. Astley Cooper's surgery lectures at Guy's Hospital included  a substantial lecture on the anatomical effects of poisons; Cooper and  his brother-in-law, Everard Home, corresponded and worked with Or-  30 	asu06600000370031001							68116288 Bytes	3973	5713	2801746280	RGB	8	600	asu06600000370031001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1102	1102	1103.jp2	/asu0660/image/1103.jp2

Brodie in his vital research on vegetable poisons, which was read  before the Royal Society and the Medico-Chirurgical Society between  1812 and 1816, and also cited by Orfila in his treatise.  To the early nineteenth century, all substances which could transform or destroy living tissue or nervous sense were designated poisons;  they could be organic or ethereal, substantial or miasmatic, from living or decaying sources. Poisons were classified by the symptoms they  produced; speculations focused on the mysterious reciprocity of poisons  so as to emphasize the homeopathic and poetic crux: that dosage alone  distinguished the point where materia medica became toxic entity.  Arsenic, mercury, antimony, opium, digitalis, and hellebore—substances Keats would have known and prescribed—were all poisonous  medicines. "The little sweet doth kill much bitterness," the poet says  in Isabella; or, The Pot of Basil, and "Even bees, the little almsmen  of spring-bowers, / Know there is richest juice in poison-flowers" (98,  103-104). The paradox of Isabella's indestructible, transforming love  for Lorenzo's decaying, poisonous corpse in this poem incorporates  all possible symbolic and pharmacological potencies within the general  pharmacopeia of Keats's poetry. Toxic substances—and a quick scan  finds all four classes of poisons represented in the poems, from nitre,  brass, miasmas and snake venom to ivy, holly, mistletoe, laurel, willow,  convolvulus, and hemlock—are summoned by Keats not just for their  conventional poetic use but for their specific pharmaceutical power,  their "net of thralldom" as he terms it in Endymion, which extends  over body, senses, and mind.  The specifically chosen botanical poisons of the Ode on Melancholy  warrant particular attention because they compound technical  knowledge and metaphorical truth in their fraught potion for recognizing the signs of false and true melancholy.  No, no, go not to Lethe, neither twist  Wolf's-bane, tight-rooted, for its poisonous wine;  Nor suffer thy pale forehead to be kiss'd  By nightshade, ruby grape of Proserpine;  Make not your rosary of yew-berries,  but when the true "melancholy fit shall fall," "Then glut thy sorrow  on a morning rose, / Or on the rainbow of the salt sand-wave, / Or  on the wealth of globed peonies" (1-17). In a letter which glosses the  philosophical pharmakon of the Ode on Melancholy, Keats writes: "Circumstances are like Clouds continually gathering and bursting—While  we are laughing the seed of some trouble is put into the wide arable  land of events—While we are laughing it sprouts . . . grows and suddenly bears a poison fruit which we must pluck."2 Wolf's-bane,  31 	asu06600000370032001							65992364 Bytes	3837	5731	1955625833	RGB	8	600	asu06600000370032001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1103	1103	1104.jp2	/asu0660/image/1104.jp2
Pharmacy in Keats's Ode on Melancholy					De Almeida, Hermione, 1950-																											asu0660000037	I  nightshade, yew-berries, and peonies are all poison flowers, or fruit:  they bear nerve poisons which act specifically, M. P. Orfila says, on  the nervous system and brain;3 as narcotico-acrids they irritate to intensity and stupefy; hardly sensitive plants, they are fatally sensitizing  potions.  Wolf's-bane or aconite, a Ranunculaea, is a common poisonous  plant; it resembles the garden horseradish and the mandrake, the plant  with the shrieking humanoid root according to folklore that Robert  Burton once proposed as a cure for insomnia in his The Anatomy of  Melancholy (1621). Mythology has the "witch-flower" aconite growing from Cerberean spittle at the entrance to Pluto and Proserpine's  underworld; in the seventeenth century the natural philosopher and  physician, J. B. van Helmont, used a dose of wolf's-bane to prove that  his soul resided in his chest. Aconitine, an alkaloid extracted from  wolf's-bane's "tight" roots, is the most swift and deadly of known  vegetable poisons with one-sixteenth of a grain proving fatal to humans.  Wolf's-bane's "poisonous wine" causes numbness of the parts of the  body to which it is applied even as it preserves the intensity of the intelligence. The specific symptoms of aconitine poisoning are all cerebro-  neural: palpitations, hallucinations, anxiety, fear of suffocation, agitation bordering on frenzy, and general mental derangement.4 That Keats  chose to invoke wolf's-bane over the "henbane" of the original draft  (henbane being a simple narcotic and cheap substitute for opium that  produced temporary general senselessness) tells us much about the kinds  of sensations and poetic inducements that the Ode comes to reject.  In 1816 Alexander Marcet, Keats's chemistry teacher at Guy's  Hospital, read a paper "On the Medicinal Properties of Stramonium"  to the Medico-Chirurgical Society of London. He noted stramonium's  accepted use in cases of mania and epilepsy and discussed his own  prescription of it for incurable cancer patients in the experimental ward  at Guy's. He spoke of his collaboration with Astley Cooper, Keats's  professor in physiology and surgery, and of how he and Cooper had  found that stramonium could allay "some of the most obstinate and  severe kinds of pain" "more effectually than any other narcotic  medicine."5 This botanical drug was a desperate remedy. Datura  stramonium or thorn-apple belongs to the generally toxic Solanacaea  family of plants; other solanum include the bitter-sweet or woody nightshade common to English thickets, and the deadly nightshade or atropa  belladonna of the Ode on Melancholy. Belladonna was used by court  ladies of the Renaissance as a cosmetic during periods of mourning to  darken the eyes and intensify the pale, bewitching beauty of loss. John  Locke suggested the leaves of Solanum Dulcamera as a poultice for  breast cancers in 1680.6 Christian F. S. Hahnemann prescribed atropa  32 	asu06600000370033001							68316584 Bytes	3957	5753	856219577	RGB	8	600	asu06600000370033001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1104	1104	1105.jp2	/asu0660/image/1105.jp2
Pharmacy in Keats's Ode on Melancholy					De Almeida, Hermione, 1950-																											asu0660000037	belladonna for the scarlet fever epidemic in 1799, and his research with  the drug although it did not cure the fever did lead to his formulation  of the doctrine of similia similibus curantur of homeopathy.7 The  atropine in deadly nightshade, according to M. P. Orfila and William  Salisbury (Keats's professor in medical botany), produces heightened  sensitivity, thirst, pallor, a vacant countenance, incoherence of speech,  dilated pupils, vertigo, intoxication, "gay delirium," terror, "horrible  imaginings," followed by blindness, loss of sensation, memory and  perception.8 In the symptoms of the belladonna or bitter-sweet we see  echoes of the effects la belle dame sans merci has on her poem's knight-  at-arms; we are also reminded of the alluring potency of Neptune's Circe  (Endymion, III, 539-554) and Lycius's Lamia with her "bitter-sweet"  month (Lamia, I, 59-60).  The small red berries of the yew tree, frequently mistaken for the  scarlet berries of belladonna, must find parallel in Proserpine's ruby  grapes; their melancholic potion must further compound itself with the  early nineteenth century's knowledge that the atropine in nightshade  was the best stimulating antidote for the paralysing poison of yew berries. Moreover, like the laurel, the leaves and berries of the yew contain the almond-scented poison, prussic acid, which can induce hallucinations and rapid death without visible deterioration of the intelligence  or perception. The warning of the Ode on Melancholy, "Make not your  rosary of yew-berries," thus invokes not just the conventional melancholy symbolized by the shady yews of English churchyards, but the  real, dark underside of Apollo's fragrant laurel wreathes and his haunting albeit healing music.  In the "wealth of globed peonies" resides all the pharmacological  and symbolic influences of poison, potion and melancholy that the Ode  would convey. The globed peony flower is our most familiar image of  the moment of captured ripeness and stationed intensity which forms  the philosophic core of Keats's aesthetic theory. Along with the yew  and the laurel, the peony evokes poetry through its connections with  the healing hymn and stirring paean of Apollo. But the peony, Orfila  and Salisbury tell us, belongs to the same family of poisonous plants  as wolf's-bane: its flower contains a high percentage of aconitine, its  roots resemble deadly black hellebore, and its reedy stalks recall those  of syrinx, hellebore and hemlock, from which musical pipes were made  in ancient times. The pharmacy of the Keatsian peony carries wolf's-  bane's chemical power to numb bodily parts and intensify sense-  perception even as it recalls the witch-flower's mythical source in the  underworld of Proserpine; it contains hellebore's pharmaceutical power  to induce dreams and madness even as it reminds us of hellebore's legendary growth at the foot of Mount Helicon; its swollen flowers bear death  33 	asu06600000370034001							65729912 Bytes	3852	5686	3224759118	RGB	8	600	asu06600000370034001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1105	1105	1106.jp2	/asu0660/image/1106.jp2

Unlike wolf's-bane, nightshade and yew berries, whose symptoms tell us much about the kinds of sensations which the Ode comes  to reject, the peony is the only botanical poison that serves for Keats  as the medium and representation of true melancholy. It is a symptom  of melancholy like the other poisons, but in its fraught multiplicity it  is a sign to the healing, intensely stressed acquiescence of poetic truth.  The peony transforms itself into the true and prescriptive image of  poetic melancholy much as in transforming legend Syrinx turned musical  reed to soothe the melancholy of Pan's poisoned mind, much as the  healing god Paeon turned paean, and Apollo's healing turned hymn.  In the ever darkening "temple of Delight," between the potion and  the poison, between the potentially dulling sweetness of the panacea  and the sharply bitter after taste of poisoned honey, veiled melancholy  keeps her "sovran shrine," "Turning to poison while the bee-mouth  sips" (27, 24). There, "She dwells with Beauty—Beauty that must die"  (21). The stationing moment of the Ode on Melancholy thus contracts  and expands at once to the pharmacological concern with the transforming reciprocity of a poison, and to the poetic, metaphysical concern  with the human psyche's power to transmute reciprocally senselessness  and intensity, pleasure and pain.  "Until we are sick, we understand not," Keats said in 1818 on the  eve of his annus mirabilus; he added in Aeschylean counterpoint,  "Byron says 'Knowledge is Sorrow'; and I go on to say that 'Sorrow  is Wisdom'."9 The resolve to help suffering mankind had governed  Keats's first choice of vocation. When poetry replaced medicine as  Keats's aspiration, it did so as a like practice born of the study of man  and inspired by the same resolve to heal and sustain. Wordsworth and  the Romantic Naturphilosophen had said that the sacred task of poetry  was to medicine the mind. The doctor Keats became a poet because  he believed that through poetry and the wisdom born of its  acknowledgement of sorrow he could best help humanity endure the  pain of being mortal. In his epic poem which he abandoned unfinished  in 1820 in the face of his impending death, Keats asks the goddess  Moneta,  If it please,  Majestic shadow, tell me: sure not all  Those melodies sung into the world's ear  Are useless: sure a poet is a sage;  A humanist, physician to all men.

Pharmacy in Keats's Ode on Melancholy					De Almeida, Hermione, 1950-																											asu0660000037	The answer, at least from the perspective of the Ode on Melancholy,  is a strong affirmative. Written in 1819 during the year of his greatest  creativity, with its strange prescription of the heightened consciousness  born of pain, and its strong counsel of stressed acquiescence to the inevitable cycle of joy and sorrow in human existence, the Ode fulfills  poetry's sacred promise to mankind.

Moby-Dick: One Way To Cut In					Thompson, Lawrance																											asu0660000006	THE  CARRE LL  Volume 3 DECEMBER, 1962 Number 2  MOBY-DICK:  ONE WAY TO CUT IN  a spicer-simson lecture  By Lawrance Thompson  HERMAN MELVILLE'S Moby-Dick remains a favorite battleground for critical controversy, and the  following proposals are not calculated to end that  controversy. They are offered merely as another attempt to cut  through the sheer bulk of verbal whale-blubber, in that monstrous  narrative, towards the vital center of Melville's meanings.  One way to start cutting in is to notice that there are two  plots interwoven throughout Moby-Dick. Most apparent and of  primary importance, of course, is the plot concerning what  happened to Captain Ahab during his vengeful and fatal quest  for the White Whale. Less apparent and yet extremely important  to Melville, as a way of controlling his ulterior meanings, is  the plot concerning what happened to the participating narrator,  Ishmael, who becomes the sole survivor of Ahab's vengeful  voyage. If the essentials of those two plots are disentangled and  summarized separately, certain very striking parallels may be  noticed. Those parallels provide hints at Melville's deepest  meanings. But an even more pertinent set of parallels or analogies, which have bearing on motives, may be derived from trying  to understand what Ahab thought he saw happening to Ahab, 	asu06600000060003001							68131308 Bytes	3958	5736	2934979695	RGB	8	600	asu06600000060003001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1114	1114	1115.jp2	/asu0660/image/1115.jp2
Moby-Dick: One Way To Cut In					Thompson, Lawrance																											asu0660000006	before and during that voyage, and what Ishmael thought he  saw happening to Ishmael.  Initially, Ahab's predicament is represented by a double image.  When first Ahab comes on deck, in Chapter 28, he is described  by Ishmael as disfigured, maimed, and scarred by two terrible  wounds. First mentioned is a "lividly whitish" scar on Ahab's  face and neck; a "rod-like mark" which Ishmael treats mysteriously, thus:  "Whether that mark was born with him, or whether it was the  scar left by some desperate wound, no one could certainly say."  Of course the second scar is the sign of that other desperate  wound inflicted by the "whitish" whale known as Moby-Dick;  that whale which had "reaped" one of Ahab's legs, during the  previous voyage. Back in Chapter 19, hints had been given  concerning the causes and the effects of the first scar; the one on  Ahab's face. That dock-haunting "prophet" named Elijah had  insinuated much when he had asked Ishmael and Queequeg if  they had already signed aboard the Pequod without seeing the  crazy Captain of that ship:  "What did they tell you about him? Say that! . . . Nothing  about that thing that happened to him off Cape Horn, long ago,  when he lay like dead for three days and nights; nothing about  that deadly scrimmage with the Spaniard afore the altar in  Santa? . . . Nothing about the silver calabash he spat into?"  Those questions are tantalizing to Ishmael and also to the  reader. They heighten interest, and make us want to know more  details. But Ishmael as narrator is permitted by Melville to keep  the reader guessing, until as late as Chapter 119, where Ahab  himself makes a dramatic revelation. There we learn about "that  thing that happened to him" and also about what Ahab thought  "that thing" meant. But before and during and after those  revelations in Chapter 119, Ishmael as narrator provides fragments of information about Ahab's early life. A few of those  fragments may be rearranged and summarized briefly, here, to  enrich our understanding of the dramatic revelation which Ahab  makes in Chapter 119.  Born on the island of Nantucket, off Cape Cod in Massachusetts, Ahab seems to have been brought up as a Quaker, even  as a devout Quaker, practising ways of communing with the 	asu06600000060004001							68900056 Bytes	3972	5779	2248999545	RGB	8	600	asu06600000060004001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1115	1115	1116.jp2	/asu0660/image/1116.jp2
Moby-Dick: One Way To Cut In					Thompson, Lawrance																											asu0660000006	"inner light." But evidence is given that he also acquired the  liberal Quaker capacity for honoring and respecting other forms  of religious worship; that after he had begun sailing the seven  seas, he had become particularly impressed by the Persian ritual  of worshipping one outer light, namely lightning, as the most  brilliant manifestation of God's power and glory. Those facts are  all we need to understand what Ahab himself explains about his  own thoughts concerning the cause and effect of that first wound.  In Chapter 119, Ahab cryptically states that once, while he  stood on the deck of a ship, like a Persian, participating in a  ritualistic admiration and worship of the dazzling white light of  God's own lightning, he had been struck down, and almost killed,  by the very thing he worshipped. According to Ahab, that blow  had seemed to be a monstrous injustice, a monstrous indignity,  divinely perpetrated for reasons inexplicable to Ahab. Thereafter,  embittered, Ahab still retained his Quaker and Christian belief  that the heavens declare the glory of God, and that the firmament  showeth His handiwork; but, thereafter, Ahab thought that God  must be cruel and malicious. In other words, he still retained  his belief that God is back of, and in control of, all natural  phenomena; but after that disillusioning event, Ahab thought he  saw reasons for viewing God as unjustly brutal in His manipulation of natural phenomena. So when that first wound and scar,  caused by the white lightning, had been followed by that second  wound and scar, caused by the white whale, Ahab thought he  saw linked analogies between the causes of those two wounds.  He thought he had been struck twice by God, or at least through  those agents or instruments of God. That thought had been  enough to drive Ahab at least to the verge of madness; enough  to provide him with a maddened motive for striking back, in a  deliberate and conscious act of metaphysical rebellion. Ahab  thought he could find no other way to achieve heroic dignity,  except through such a boldly courageous resistance to the malice  of the Striker; through such defiance of metaphysical brutality;  through such protest against metaphysical injustice. Explaining  his motives, in Chapter 119, Ahab even insisted that his metaphysical rebellion could translate death into the only possible  form of tragic victory available to him.  That paraphrase of Ahab's thoughts concerning his predica- 	asu06600000060005001							68346364 Bytes	3928	5798	1831744515	RGB	8	600	asu06600000060005001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1116	1116	1117.jp2	/asu0660/image/1117.jp2
Moby-Dick: One Way To Cut In					Thompson, Lawrance																											asu0660000006	ment may now be documented by quoting Ahab's own words, as  given in Chapter 119. The dramatic setting there represents the  Pequod as having passed through part of a hurricane, at sea, and  as having come into the dead center or "eye" of the storm. As the  wind temporarily died down, and as the eerie silence and darkness frightened the sailors on deck, they were further alarmed by  static lightning, or St. Elmo's fire, which flared unexpectedly on  masts and yardarms, like candles before an altar. Awestruck, the  superstitious officers and crew fell to their knees, grovelling and  praying. But Ahab, when he came on deck to find them thus  cowed, did not grovel. He merely glanced at the static lightning  and said,  "Aye, aye, men! Look up at it; mark it well; the white flame  but lights the way to the White Whale!"  Apparently Ahab thus implied his thought that the white  lightning and the White Whale were merely two different manifestations of one and the same Power, each sinewed by divine  malice. Then, as a way of expressing his attitude of bold defiance  towards that malicious Power, Ahab seized in his left hand the  lightning-rod-chain of the main-mast, raised his right arm aloft,  looked up scornfully at the candle-like flames, and began to pray  aloud. Rather, he began to blaspheme, in words which gave  explicit statement to his metaphysical rebellion, and even to why  he thought his attitude was justified:  "Oh! thou clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas 1 as  Persian once did worship, till in the sacramental act so burned  by thee, that to this hour I bear the scar; I now know thee, thou  clear spirit, and I now know that thy right worship is defiance."  Any reader who is trying to understand Ahab's predicament  in terms of Ahab's motives, or is trying to understand what Ahab  thought had already happened to him prior to this vengeful  voyage, may see how those blasphemous words cut through to  the very heart of Ahab's problem. Events had contradicted his  beliefs. Circumstances had transformed his love and worship of  God into hatred and defiance, thus leaving him embittered and  religiously disillusioned. Ahab's blasphemous words reveal that  he remained a believer, but that all of his previous beliefs  concerning the benevolence of God had simply become inverted.  Continuing his blasphemous prayer, Ahab further revealed his  Vv. 	asu06600000060006001							68828980 Bytes	3981	5760	3527575248	RGB	8	600	asu06600000060006001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1117	1117	1118.jp2	/asu0660/image/1118.jp2
Moby-Dick: One Way To Cut In					Thompson, Lawrance																											asu0660000006	primary belief in the malice of God:  "To neither love nor reverence wilt thou be kind; and e'en  for hate thou canst but kill; and all are killed."  For Ahab, it would seem, death had become a fact which his  wounds and scars caused him to view in a peculiar light. Instead  of voicing Christian acceptance of the fact that all men must die,  Ahab permitted his words to imply his thought that, sooner or  later, all men are murdered, either by permissive or by aggressive  and vindictive acts of God. Hence Ahab's conclusion that he had  no choice but to go towards death, like a tragic hero, still  defying:  "No fearless fool now fronts thee. I own thy speechless, place-  less power; but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will I  dispute its unconditional, unintegral mastery in me . . . Oh, thou  clear spirit, of thy fire thou madest me, and like a true child of  fire, I breathe it back to thee."  That important passage in Chapter 119 helps us take bearings  on what happened to Captain Ahab, as viewed from the perspective of his own thoughts concerning his own motivations. But  did Ahab maintain that metaphysical defiance to the very end  of the story? He did. So we may profitably compare his blasphemies, uttered to the white static lightning, and his blasphemies  uttered to the great White Whale, when Ahab faced that murderous monster, just after it had rammed a hole in the hull of  the Pequod and had left it to sink, carrying all hands aboard to  death, death, death. Ahab, realizing that the moment had come  when his metaphysical rebellion could give him what he thought  to be his ultimate chance to achieve tragic victory, turned first  to take leave of the sinking Pequod. His words imply that he  viewed his ship as an inseparable part of himself, and as an  emblem of his own predicament:  "Oh! ye three unsurrendered spires of mine; thou uncracked  keel; and only god-bullied hull ..."  That descriptive epithet, "god-bullied," is worth particular  notice. It marks the only moment in the entire narrative when  Ahab overtly substituted the word "god" for the word "whale;"  the only moment when Ahab overtly revealed what the white  whale meant to Ahab. But he had come close to saying much the  same thing, back in Chapter 36, when he had first explained to  ii 	asu06600000060007001							67323736 Bytes	3917	5726	3434740430	RGB	8	600	asu06600000060007001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1118	1118	1119.jp2	/asu0660/image/1119.jp2
Moby-Dick: One Way To Cut In					Thompson, Lawrance																											asu0660000006	I  his officers and crew the vengeful purpose of this voyage: to  strike back at the White Whale. Starbuck, the devout Christian  Starbuck, had been so shocked by Ahab's announcement, in  Chapter 36, that he had said to Ahab, in remonstrance:  "Vengeance on a dumb brute, that simply smote thee from  blindest instinct! Madness! To be enraged with a dumb thing,  Captain Ahab, seems blasphemous."  Answering, Ahab had tried to explain to Starbuck how it  happens that one man's truth is another man's madness. Then he  had concluded by insinuating his own thoughts concerning the  whale-God correlation:  ". . . and be the white whale agent [that is, agent of God],  or be the white whale principal [that is, God incarnate], I will  wreak that hate upon him. Talk not to me of blasphemy,  man . . ."  Starbuck had completely understood Ahab's covert insinuations: in Chapter 38, he had referred to them as revealing Ahab's  "heaven-insulting purpose." So if we carry those hints over to  Ahab's last words, related meanings become clearer. After Ahab  had taken leave of the sinking Pequod, by saying farewell to  that "god-bullied hull," he turned to confront the white whale  as either agent or principal; it made no difference to Ahab. So  his last words, once again taking the form of blasphemous  prayer, clinch the evidence concerning what Ahab thought had  happened, and was happening, to him:  "Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering  whale . . ."  (Notice that return to the same reproach which Ahab had  made to the white static lightning: all are destroyed, all are  killed, through metaphysical malice. To Ahab, the white lightning and the white whale are still manifestations of one and  the same divine injustice. Now the continuation of this final  blasphemous prayer:)  ". . . to the last I grapple with thee; from hell's heart I stab  at thee; for hate's sake I spit my last breath at thee. Sink all  coffins and all hearses to one common pool! And since neither  can be mine, let me then tow to pieces, while still chasing thee,  though tied to thee, thou damned whale! Thus, I give up the  spear!"  • 6  \ 	asu06600000060008001							68417108 Bytes	3928	5804	2090309168	RGB	8	600	asu06600000060008001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1119	1119	1120.jp2	/asu0660/image/1120.jp2
Moby-Dick: One Way To Cut In					Thompson, Lawrance																											asu0660000006	Then Ahab threw the harpoon, and went to his death, killed  by his own harpoon line, fouled around his own neck. Nevertheless, it is clear that Ahab thought his final bold defiance had  translated his foreseen death into a dignified, heroic, and tragic  victory.  If Moby-Dick contained only that one plot, we as readers  might derive considerable significance from the fact that Melville  arranged to end that story by letting Ahab go to his death,  killed by his own harpoon line, fouled around his own neck.  But Melville's interweaving of that plot with "the story of what  happened to Ishmael" has this effect: Ishmael's narrative of his  own predicament provides the context for Ahab's story. The  narrative begins and ends with Ishmael, and with Ishmael's  insinuative evaluation of events. So let us briefly summarize that  other plot, now, with particular emphasis on what Ishmael  thought he saw as happening, or as having happened, to him.  Once again, we are after motives, and after the values assigned  to those motives by Ishmael.  In the first chapter, and even in the first paragraph of that  first chapter, Ishmael is permitted to start talking about his own  wounds, or at least about his own suffering from a peculiar form  of hypochondria. He says that whenever he becomes too deeply  depressed, he has frequently tried to escape from his obsessive  melancholy by going to sea as an ordinary sailor. That was how  it happened, he tells us, that he shipped with Captain Ahab  aboard the Pequod. But he also throws light, there, on the  particular nature of his obsession or melancholy or hypochondria,  from which he has long suffered. Instead of discussing his problem directly, however, he plays hide and seek behind a set of  verbal veils, thus:  "Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth;  whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever  I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and  bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a  strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping  into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off—  then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can."  From the evidence thus offered, it would seem that Ishmael 	asu06600000060009001							67649608 Bytes	3917	5755	553106681	RGB	8	600	asu06600000060009001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1120	1120	1121.jp2	/asu0660/image/1121.jp2
Moby-Dick: One Way To Cut In					Thompson, Lawrance																											asu0660000006	happened to make this death-fated cruise with Captain Ahab at  a time when Ishmael was attempting to escape from his own  maddening thoughts concerning death. With what result? Ironically, Ishmael was the only one who was permitted to watch all  others aboard the Pequod go to death. Then he found himself,  alone, in the middle of the Pacific, floating on a coffin, with  leisure to indulge his hypochondriac thoughts concerning death.  When rescued, he insinuates, he returned feeling himself cast in  the role of a Job's messenger: "and I only am escaped alone to  tell thee"—about the meanings of life and death, as he viewed  them, before and during and after that death-freighted cruise.  Ishmael never lets us know how and why he developed his  hypochondriac obsession with death. He merely hints. But if we  assemble a few of his most pertinent hints we can acquire all the  evidence we need, to understand his peculiar viewpoint and  motivations. One big hint, which acts as a kind of magnet in  attracting others, occurs in the very first sentence of the first  chapter:  "Call me Ishmael."  From that start, he keeps assigning his own values to the  meaning of that name. He keeps reminding us that, in the Bible,  his namesake had become an embittered outcast, disowned by his  father; disinherited and abandoned. Stressing the fact that, in a  sense, the Biblical Ishmael had thus become an orphan, Melville's  Ishmael repeatedly refers to himself as an orphan. The word  occurs at the very close of his narrative: when the devious-cruising Rachel, searching for its own lost children, found and  rescued Ishmael from his precarious perch on that floating coffin,  the rescuers "only found another orphan." As it was in the  beginning, so now: call me Ishmael.  Consider next some related hints, magnetized by that name.  Ishmael's use of the Biblical phrase, "I only . . . alone" picks up  insinuative overtones which he himself correlates with meanings  assigned by Ishmael to the word, "abandonment." As will be  shown, Ishmael cumulatively endows these various terms with  metaphysical overtones of meaning. Like Ahab, Ishmael feels  (and says that he feels) at times as though he had been abandoned by the Heavenly Father. Why? He does not know; but  like Ahab he wishes he did know. That is the question, the mys- 	asu06600000060010001							68261856 Bytes	3942	5769	3688674537	RGB	8	600	asu06600000060010001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1121	1121	1122.jp2	/asu0660/image/1122.jp2
Moby-Dick: One Way To Cut In					Thompson, Lawrance																											asu0660000006	tery, over which Ishmael broods in his own way, even while  Ahab is permitted to brood over it in Ahab's own way. But  Ishmael takes us deeper into the question, with further hints, in  Chapter 42 entitled "The Whiteness of the Whale." Once again,  that chapter is bloated with verbal whale blubber; but the  patient reader who cuts away enough of the fatty tissue, there,  may get close to the heart of Ishmael's obsession. The start is  familiar:  "What the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what,  at times, he was to me, as yet remains unsaid."  Then Ishmael goes on to say, through his veils of words, that  he sees at least two tantalizing possibilities of meaning in all  natural whiteness; sees, and finds something maddening in the  combination of those two possibilities. First of all, he sees the  possibility that, back of all the whiteness generally called holy  because it is considered to be the living visible garment of God,  there may be nothing except "heartless voids." In other words,  Ishmael considers the possibility that, back of nature, there may  be no God. The second possibility, according to Ishmael, is that  back of nature there may be a God who is heartless. If the former  possibility is true, Ishmael insinuates, that would explain why  there is no connection between man's just deserts, and what he  gets; why there is no plan or purpose in the universe. But if the  latter possibility is true, Ishmael further insinuates, and if there  is a God who is heartless and indifferent, that would explain his  own sense of metaphysical abandonment. That would explain  how it happens that God does not care how much any Job-like  man may suffer; how it happens that God does not care about  all the horrors which engulf the innocent; how it happens that  God does not care about what is, to Ishmael as well as to Ahab,  the ultimate horror which overtakes mankind: death.  If that paraphrase of Ishmael's various hints and insinuations  comes anywhere near to being accurate, then it may be said  significantly that Ishmael's predicament is represented as having  this much in common with Ahab's predicament: each is obsessively preoccupied with religious disillusionment. But does Ishmael ever put aside his insinuative veils of words, long enough  to come right out into the open, with an expression of his own  religious disillusionment? He does, and more than once. Perhaps  • 9 	asu06600000060011001							68391664 Bytes	3936	5790	2957864584	RGB	8	600	asu06600000060011001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1122	1122	1123.jp2	/asu0660/image/1123.jp2
Moby-Dick: One Way To Cut In					Thompson, Lawrance																											asu0660000006	the most overt statement, which may be used to clinch that point,  occurs in Chapter 114. Ishmael there generalizes on the voyage  of the soul, or the progress of human consciousness, through  separate phases of religious belief to and through religious disillusionment. He says that the truly perceptive soul should voyage  through belief and through disbelief, ultimately, to a detached  attitude of philosophic indifference; to a form of agnosticism or  of not-knowing, which might be expressed by a merely speculative usage of the one word, "If." Could such ideal progress be  achieved, Ishmael says, the motion of consciousness would be as  follows:  ". . . through infancy's unconscious spell, boyhood's thoughtless faith, adolescence's doubt (the common doom), the scepticism, then disbelief, resting at last in manhood's pondering  repose of If."  Unfortunately, Ishmael continues, the actual progress of the  soul does not follow that ideal straight line of ascent. Instead,  the anguish of hoping and doubting and fearing creates a circular  pattern, in experience. Ishmael phrases that concept, in his continuation of the passage quoted from Chapter 114, thus:  "But once gone through, we trace the round again; and are  infants, boys, and men, and Ifs eternally. . . . Our souls are like  those orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing them.  . . . Where is the foundling's father hidden?"  Any reader who is trying to cut in through the verbal whale  blubber of Moby-Dick to the heart of Melville's darkest meanings, as represented in Ishmael's controlling attitude, should find  that passage in Chapter 114 extremely helpful. It also throws  light on another very important fact. Ishmael, as narrator, does  indeed "trace the round again" and again, with the result that  he does not maintain a consistent viewpoint, either in his evaluations of what happened to Captain Ahab, or in his evaluations  of what happened to Ishmael. The variability of his viewpoint is  indicated by his repeated uses of the phrase, "at times," as in the  passage already quoted concerning what, "at times," the white  whale meant to Ishmael. There are times when Ishmael as narrator achieves enough philosophic detachment to view Ahab's  predicament as merely a pathetic form of bad thinking. There  are times when the philosophic problem of subject and object  • 10 	asu06600000060012001							67915552 Bytes	3929	5760	3354066452	RGB	8	600	asu06600000060012001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1123	1123	1124.jp2	/asu0660/image/1124.jp2
Moby-Dick: One Way To Cut In					Thompson, Lawrance																											asu0660000006	fascinates Ishmael. For example, in one of his clearest moments  of detachment, Ishmael is permitted to describe that doubloon  nailed to the mast. He sees it as a kind of mirror in which each  person unconsciously finds merely the reflection of his own distorted and subjective values. Most of the time, however, Ishmael  himself is so obsessively preoccupied with his own subjective  values, that most of his descriptions reflect and mirror his own  religious disillusionment.  For example, in Chapter 93 entitled "The Castaway," Ishmael  describes the kind of madness which overtook the Negro cabin  boy, Pip, when Pip found himself alone and abandoned, after  he had fallen out of a whale-boat for the second time, during  a whale-chase. What value does Ishmael assign to that event?  Precisely the value which reveals his own distorted and obsessive  thoughts:  "... The intense concentration of self in the middle of such  a heartless immensity, my God! who can tell it?. . . By the  merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him; but from that  hour the little Negro went about the deck an idiot; such, at least  they said he was. The sea had jeeringly kept his finite body up,  but drowned the infinite of his soul. Not drowned entirely,  though. Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths... He  saw God's foot upon the treadle of the loom, and spoke it..."  Ishmael goes on to insinuate, there, that because God failed  to answer Pip's anguished prayer for help, the sense of both  physical and metaphysical abandonment had driven Pip insane.  At least, Ishmael adds, "his shipmates called him mad." But at  that point Ishmael (who is a Devil at quoting or paraphrasing  Scripture) twists a passage in Paul's First Letter to the Corinthians, first chapter, where Paul played with paradoxes thus:  "Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?. . . But  God hath chosen the foolish things of this world to confound the  wise." Sarcastically, Ishmael twists the Pauline paradox by continuing his comment on Pip's maddening insight, thus:  "So man's insanity is heaven's sense; and wandering from all  mortal reason, man comes at last to that celestial thought, which,  to reason, is absurd and frantic; and weal or woe, feels then  uncompromised, indifferent as his God."  Part of Ishmael's insinuation, there, would seem to be that  • 11 	asu06600000060013001							67925312 Bytes	3935	5752	1657479720	RGB	8	600	asu06600000060013001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1124	1124	1125.jp2	/asu0660/image/1125.jp2
Moby-Dick: One Way To Cut In					Thompson, Lawrance																											asu0660000006	when man actually gets the sense of what does (and does not)  go on, in Heaven, then man indeed goes mad; then man even  tries to match God's indifference by being indifferent towards  God. But in concluding that passage, Ishmael suggests a further  analogy which has bearing on his thoughts concerning how and  why this voyage with Ahab had heightened Ishmael's religious  disillusionment. He ends by drawing a parallel between Pip's  maddening predicament, as a castaway, and Ishmael's own maddening predicament, alone, orphaned, and floating on a coffin:  ". . . and in the sequel of the narrative [that is, in the  Epilogue], it will then be seen what like abandonment befell  myself."  Ishmael's way of assigning values to Pip's predicament of  abandonment is very strikingly analogous to Ahab's. In Chapter  125, when Ahab finds the Manxman scolding Pip, Ahab rebukes  the Manxman and talks with Pip just long enough to realize how  completely mad Pip has become. Then Ahab looks up at the sky  and says, reproachfully.  "There can be no hearts above the snow-line. Oh, ye frozen  heavens! look down here. Ye did beget this luckless child, and  have abandoned him, ye creative libertines."  Continuing, Ahab adds an overt generalization which is at one  with so many of Ishmael's covert insinuations:  "Lo! ye believers in gods all goodness, and in man all ill, lo  you! see the omniscient gods oblivious of suffering man. . ."  These brief quotations provide enough textual evidence to  demonstrate the significance of the parallels or analogies between  the two major plots in Moby-Dick; parallels, particularly, between what Captain Ahab thought had happened to himself,  and what Ishmael thought had happened to Ahab, to Pip, and  to Ishmael. The major difference is that Ahab's religious disillusionment is represented as finding expression in very bold acts  of metaphysical rebellion and defiance, while Ishmael's religious  disillusionment finds expression in metaphysical protests which  are merely verbal. Nevertheless, this way of trying to cut in  towards the heart of Melville's ulterior meanings may further  suggest that Melville's very sympathetic probings of related elements in these two plots could possibly reflect some aspects of  Melville's own obsessive disillusionment.  • 12  i 	asu06600000060014001							69289088 Bytes	3967	5819	3800785284	RGB	8	600	asu06600000060014001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1125	1125	1126.jp2	/asu0660/image/1126.jp2

Morgan, Jr.  Through the generosity of Mrs. Homer Saint-Gaudens, the  Richter Library has recently come into possession of three  exceptionally beautiful Augustus Saint-Gaudens bronzes. Two  of these are reproduced in this issue. The other, a circular  medallion portrait of Robert Louis Stevenson, will be described  in a later issue of The Carrell.  Of the two reproduced here, one, the Amor Caritas, is mentioned at some length in the second volume of The Reminiscences  of Augustus Saint-Gaudens. In one of his passages of amplification, Homer Saint-Gaudens says:  Allied with work on the Stevenson came work on  the other medallions, the Angel with the Tablet,  and the reduced bas-reliefs, which, together with  the larger work in two exhibitions, had much to  do with the French Government's creating my  father an officer of The Legion of Honor, with  their making him a Corresponding Member of the  Societe des Beaux Arts, and with their offering  to purchase certain of his bronzes for the Luxembourg Museum.  The original of the Angel mentioned by Homer became known  as the Amor Caritas and was accepted by the Luxembourg.  Homer mentions the fact that his father was so well pleased  with the success of the full-sized original that he made several  reductions. It is one of these that Mrs. Saint-Gaudens has presented to the University Library.  The bronze head reproduced on the opposite page is not so  easy to identify. Dr. Virgil Barker has suggested that it is a  study of the head of the Diana statue that Saint-Gaudens fashioned for the old Madison Square Garden. The resemblance is  certainly striking and as a result it is consistently referred to  in the Library as the Diana head. The face is beautifully  modelled and has a serene and noble expression appropriate  to the subject. It is approximately eight inches high and is  mounted on a handsome wooden base.  • 13  -   I 	asu06600000060019001							67793480 Bytes	3932	5744	3866231374	RGB	8	600	asu06600000060019001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1130	1130	1131.jp2	/asu0660/image/1131.jp2

At the dedication of the Library of the Georgia Institute of Technology a few years ago,  Dr. Alan Waterman, Director of the National Science Foundation, asked his audience this question:  Have we not reached a new crisis in the history  of learning that calls for a revolution in method  as far-reaching and as radical as the invention of  paper and the printing-press?  The question and others he raised on that occasion remain  with us. We are still unable to handle the information we are  developing. Scholars are still inclined to continue along traditional lines, enjoying the illusion that a survey of published  material and close contact with those working in their area can  keep them abreast of important developments. This, unhappily,  is no longer possible. Bringing under control the world's literature, or that part of it with which this university is concerned,  is your librarians' job.  Librarians work on information storage, information retrieval,  and the advances in electronics that promise to alter so much  of the mechanical part of our daily lives. They are actively  engaged with government and with industry in an effort to simplify that part of the scholar's work for which they feel a special  responsibility. They follow closely developments in information  theory. Since the greatest attention these days is given to scientific research and development it is likely to be true for a while  that the problems connected with the literature of the sciences  will get the most attention, but if anyone should suppose that  • 14 	asu06600000060020001							67823672 Bytes	3923	5761	3001830322	RGB	8	600	asu06600000060020001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1131	1131	1132.jp2	/asu0660/image/1132.jp2

The problems suggested here are even more acute for the humanities and the social sciences.  This new Library provides the completely flexible plan within  which new discoveries and new methods may be readily incorporated. You are fortunate that it is in the hands of men and  women who have such intimate acquaintance with its unique  problems and potentialities. Every university, of course, is unique  in some ways and every university library must be unique. The  university's need for separate undergraduate libraries, browsing  rooms, reserve book rooms, is intimately related to other special  needs of the institution and each of these must be treated in  terms of the special situation which the library is designed to  serve. Harvard, for example, with its ninety-two libraries, and  those state university systems in which the central university is  only the main unit in a complex of colleges and universities  designed to serve communities in a state-wide educational system, have problems that are radically different from the problem  here at Miami.  The one thing that architects and librarians can be absolutely  certain of as they plan is that there will be change, change in  methods, change in ways of dealing with materials. Programs  will change. Honors programs, tutorials, preceptorials, seminars,  and their variants will come and go. This superbly flexible building has been carefully designed to meet these changing needs.  And not only must changes within the university be kept in  mind. The relations that exist today between major research  institutions in the states within which they work, the region  within which they work, and the research libraries in the rest of  the country, must be considered. Given your location, I would  suppose your planning must have been conducted in recent years  with a certain amount of attention to the possibility of intercontinental relations.  One's first impression of this building is one of spaciousness  and relaxation. The planners have obviously had flexibility,  functionality and informality in mind as they have achieved this  effect. The kind of flexibility that is needed to meet the problems  which are certain to arise, and an integrity in planning, are  characteristics one would expect to find associated with the  • 15 	asu06600000060021001							67871956 Bytes	3929	5755	2277926649	RGB	8	600	asu06600000060021001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1132	1132	1133.jp2	/asu0660/image/1133.jp2

For careful planning and integrity  are those ingrained and cultivated traits which have made your  Librarian prominent among the librarians of this country. The  colleagues of Dr. Archie L. McNeal have learned to expect  cooperation, full and generous cooperation in any sound and  worthwhile program. Those of us who have had the opportunity  to see him at work at home and abroad on some of the most  delicate and vexatious problems that have faced us in recent  years have come to expect and to admire his calmness and his  understanding, his firmness, his courage, and above all his integrity.  It is customary on such an occasion as this to speak of the  University Library as the heart of the university or the citadel of  learning. I like very much a phrase which was used recently by  one of my favorite authors who spoke of the reading room of  the college library as "the very temple of democracy." I subscribe  to these sentiments. But these things are true only to the extent  that the faculty of a university makes them true.  This building will in time contain a great library. It will  embody the collective judgment, discrimination, and generosity  of many people. It can be transformed into the dynamic institution it is capable of becoming only by the faculty. If it is to  become the workshop it might be, the teaching instrument it  can be, the faculty must see to it.  For several years I had the pleasure of working in those parts  of the world where the developing nations are expanding so  rapidly. I talked with many university officials about their educational needs and especially about their library needs. They all  wanted libraries, they all wanted books, they all were proud of  their libraries and their books. But all too frequently the libraries  were little better than mausoleums.  Sometimes they served as study halls; all too frequently they  were unorganized collections that had little relation to the educational program of the institution. Some of them were magnificent  in appearance and in the richness of their holdings; some of them  collected assiduously for reasons that were sometimes not altogether clear; rarely was there any vital connection between the  material in the books and the work that the students were asked  or expected to do. Too frequently the lecturer lectured, the  • 16 	asu06600000060022001							67654436 Bytes	3920	5751	1101356597	RGB	8	600	asu06600000060022001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1133	1133	1134.jp2	/asu0660/image/1134.jp2

Instead of making freely available to their students the materials that they themselves had discovered so that class time  could be used to present material not available in books, for  critical discussion, and for consideration of principles which  might be derived from and further illuminated by the students'  independent study in the library, many professors actually seemed  unwilling to allow students to have access to the sources of their  own materials.  Whenever such a system prevails, and this is not an exclusive  feature of the education of any single country, there is little that  a library can do. It is only when faculties have a full understanding of the part that a library can play in assisting the learning  process and when their teaching is carried on in terms of the  library's potential that a building such as this, and the library  which it will soon house, can achieve the high purposes to which  they will shortly be dedicated.  Your librarians are going to need from students, teachers,  research staff, administrators and friends all the wisdom, understanding, criticism, loving attention, and financial support of  which each of you is capable. But a very special obligation rests  upon the faculty. Only the faculty can require the kind of use  that will release the full energies of students, staff, and books, and  only the faculty can excite the kind of enthusiasm which will  enable your librarians to do the work of which they are capable  and for which they are now prepared.  But just as there is a special obligation resting upon the faculty, so the faculty has here a special opportunity. I congratulate  them. I congratulate the staff, the students, and all those who  have played a part in this splendid achievement, and I thank  you for letting me have a part in this occasion.  17 	asu06600000060023001							68827280 Bytes	3983	5757	1503277051	RGB	8	600	asu06600000060023001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1134	1134	1135.jp2	/asu0660/image/1135.jp2
Note on a Caricature Collection					Selle, Mildred H.																											asu0660000006	Note on a Caricature Collection  WrHILE READERS in our Library have always been  able to view contemporary affairs as illustrated or  satirized in Punch, The New Yorker, the daily papers  or weekly magazines of many countries, it is only within recent  years that the caricaturists of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries have become well enough represented in our collections  to make extensive comparisons among them possible.  Among books given to us by Mrs. O.J. Tanner are an elephant  folio of the complete works of Hogarth which complements other  early editions of his works already in our collection, and an  elephant folio of the works of James Gillray, nearly our first  examples of his work. With these came a number of nineteenth  century novels illustrated by Cruikshank. Recently, through the  gift of Dr. David Klein, a professor of English, now retired, we  are able to offer the student of politics or government, of literature or art, a collection of prints, chiefly George Cruikshank's,  in considerable variety. There are several broadsides, for example; illustrations for popular ballads; a proof sheet, uncut, of  eight plates for The Drunkard's Children, prints from privately  printed plates executed for John Ruskin, many political cartoons  of varying degrees of bite, from spoofing to harshest satire.  All of these should be entertaining to work with, as will also  be the case with the 273 Spy prints from Vanity Fair in the same  collection. But the most attractive problem for the art student  may well be a comparison between a group of four Hogarth  prints and George Cruikshank's copies of them which were done  for Hogarth Moralized (1831). The prints portray group situations and attitudes that appealed to Hogarth's sense of the ridiculous; his treatment of the groups emphasizes skillfully and with  nice detail the animal in man. Differences between the two artists'  interpretation of character is immediately evident in Hogarth's  The Public Lecture that is reproduced in this issue of The Carrell  and the Cruikshank copy of it on the opposite page. The other  prints of the set, The Oratorio, The Laughing Audience, and The  Company of Undertakers are equally revelatory of the personalities and styles of the two artists.

White Barbarians, Arise!																																asu0660000006	WHITE BARBARIANS, ARISE!  Arnold J. Toynbee has characterized the inhabitants of American Appalachia as the White Barbarians of the New World.  These Blue Ridge mountain people, says Toynbee, are in the  doleful condition of having lost a whilom civilization, whereas  the Barbarians of the Old World—Kurds, Riffis and Hairy Ainus  —may be excused in that they never arose from barbarism.  The judgment stems from a Toynbee theory that immigration  to a distant country, and the challenges met there, are vitalizing  forces. Up to a point. Climate can nip cultural growth. Norse  civilization flowered in mild Iceland; died in Greenland.  This generalization Toynbee polished so smooth that he  slipped on it. His Atlantic Seaboard has Massachusetts as the  optimum climate and challenge to nurture civilization. Down  East in chilly Maine the natives reverted. South Florida's location, 1,500 miles south of the optimum zone, indites us.  White Barbarians of the New World, arise! We share the  same latitude as did Ancient Greece. The Dean of the Columbia  School of Library Services (see page 14) commends the planning  and integrity of the Richter Library. Further, he compares it  not unkindly with the libraries of an institution plumb in the  center of Toynbee's optimum zone.  Dean Dalton's dedicatory encomia, however, are not lacking  in adjurations on the responsibilities inherent in the University's  acceptance of this magnificent building. Explicitly, only the  faculty can transform the Richter Library into "the dynamic  institution it is capable of becoming."  In support of Dean Dalton's thesis, The Carrell at once augmented its Editorial Committee (see inside front cover) to  obtain greater faculty participation in publication and in support  of the Richter Library as a teaching and research instrument.  A similar move was made last Spring by the Friends of the  University of Miami Library, which reduced its regular membership fee of $10 (covering all lectures and subscriptions to  The Carrell) to $5 for University faculty and all librarians and  school teachers of the area.  If this be a Commercial, make the most of it!

"A Collector of Characters" brochure								Brochure found within the pages of this issue.																								asu0660000006	THEODORE  SPICER-SIMSON  was a sculptor-artist of great  versatility, an Englishman who  lived and worked in Paris, London  and the United States, whose chief  interest, as an artist, was human  character. For more than fifty years,  distinguished men and women of  many countries sat to him for their  portraits, in marble and in bronze.  He revived the ancient and almost  forgotten art of the portrait medallion, working his subtle character  interpretations in enduring metal.  He was recognized internationally  as one of the greatest of modern  medalists.  This book contains the story of  his life in art as he wrote it, simply  and directly, and his searching  thoughts and memorable sayings  about art. It presents a great array  of his imperishable portraits, chiefly as bronze medallions.  Individual medallions, busts and  drawings by Spicer-Simson are  today in the possession of the families of the subjects or in such great  museums of the world as the British Museum, the Victoria and  Albert, the Ashmolean of Oxford,  the National Portrait Gallery of  London,  the  Kaiser  Friedrich  in  London, the Kaiser Friedrich in  Berlin, the Metropolitan in New  York, the Atheneum in Boston, and  many others.  The most complete and important collection of his bronze portrait medallions, owned by Mrs.  Spicer-Simson, is now on permanent loan and exhibition at the  University of Miami Library, in  Coral Gables, Florida.  Among the many distinguished  people whose portraits in bronze,  marble, ink or pencil are reproduced in this book, from the collection at the University of Miami,  are: Robert Frost, Theodore Dreiser,  Sherwood Anderson, Henry Ford,  H. L. Mencken, Alexander Graham  Bell, David Fairchild, Robert Milli-  kan, Winston Churchill, George  Bernard Shaw, Joseph Conrad, John  Galsworthy, Arnold Bennett, William Butler Yeats, W. H. Hudson,  H. G. Wells, Hugh Walpole, Padraic  Colum, James Stephens, Hervey  Allen, Selma Lagerlof, Gamaliel  Bradford, Edward Arlington Robinson, Thomas Barbour, Elinor  Wylie, Van Wyck Brooks, James  Joyce, and many others.  &lt;/&gt;  CD  Q.

Scraps from Tribeca					Freeman, Jane																											asu0660000042	THE  CARRELL  Volume 30 1992  Jane Freeman  Scraps from Tribeca  Jane Freeman, a Miamian who once audited courses at the University of Miami and whose sister, Kathy, has recently joined the English  Department, has long lived in New York City, typing manuscripts for  a living and painting and exhibiting when she could. In recent years,  immediately inspired by the TV show Beauty and the Beast, she has  begun to produce dioramas, miniature boxed rooms largely assembled  from debris gathered in the streets around her loft in Tribeca and  elsewhere in the city. Ms. Freeman's loving eye for detail both in her  art and the world around her is seen in her miniatures and in her poems  and correspondence. The following excerpts are from letters written  over the years to the undersigned. They begin with the first mention  of a miniature construction (in 1986), are in chronological order, and,  apart from being selected passages, have been edited in no way.  Laurence Donovan  March 5, 1986  Some months ago I sat in on a class of Harold Bloom's at Yale,  when I visited my sister Kathy. What a character he is, I gathered at  first glance, an appreciation that grew over that couple of hours. He  looks like the Cowardly Lion with his mournful doughy sad-clown series  of facial expressions. I must say his treatment of Tennyson was  somewhat beyond me — my brain is rusty and slow, and yearns like  the Undead for intellectual juice. In the library at Yale was an exhibit  of the illustrations of Fritz Eichenberg. It so happened at that time I  was in the very midst of a newborn obsession over Jane Eyre, so seeing  1 	asu06600000420003001							66863872 Bytes	3885	5735	872191241	RGB	8	600	asu06600000420003001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1149	1149	1150.jp2	/asu0660/image/1150.jp2
Scraps from Tribeca					Freeman, Jane																											asu0660000042	Eichenberg's original engravings, woodcuts, drawings for, if not J.E.  (though I own the Random House version), then Wuthering Heights  as second-best made me happy. Concordant with my month-long obsession I built a Victorian country mansion, doll-house size, into four  shelves of my bookcase, Parian fireplaces, library globes and all . . .  July 27, 1986  Last night, went for drinks on the 107th floor of the World Trade  Center. Watched a rainy day end from way-up-high. Could see all the  way out of the harbor, from the river to the bay to the ocean. Despite  her recent super-fete, Miss Liberty looked wondrously lonely in the vast,  moss-gray, rhino-skinned water. Whistler would have painted it: all  grizzle-ashen, no lines, a few moist lights from south Jersey: soundless,  colorful, stealthful. The picture window finally & incrementally  retracted its vague view, stole back the sense of depth, like a TV just  shut off—opaque and empty gray-green withdrawal. I watched Japanese  businessmen sip opulently endowed cocktails, I ate crab fritters and  goat cheese, I eyed the sophisticated women—who all seemed blond,  glossy, silk-legged, shiny-shouldered, bejeweled and heeled; universally relaxed, like draped Odalisques. Recently I bought my first pair of  high (lVi") heels and managed to wear them unwobblingly with a  mighty-tight black skirt. The shoes are black patent leather I think,  though because they were so cheap they may be made of plastic or even  rhoplex. What the hell is patent leather, anyway? To go with the shoes,  I'm trying to build my atrophic calves, in an exercise studio called  (shamefully) "Butt Busters," and am lifting free weights too. Am up  to 3-lb. weights. Isn't that silly? You wouldn't catch Miss Eyre thus  employed. Ah, if only life were as simple as smoothing down a clean  white tucker, redoing a loose chignon.  June 18, 1987  I have supper each balmy summer night on the roof, where I've  installed my house plants and windchimes for the season. The dark  comes, the lights go on in the closeby buildings that become for me,  like sheets of slides. Such fascinating compositions people make in the  lightbox squares of their coop lofts. Stacks of vignettes screened in all  that revelatory proud square-footage. Little do they know I watch the  men in boxer shorts and women in undershirts feeding tables of toddlers; and artists in the nude struggling with their unwieldy, unyielding  artworks; people alone, in couples, in groups; people bedding down,  watching television (the flickering flat color-images thrusting thalo hues  in the already-bizarre colorations of the rooms); an occasional party 	asu06600000420004001							66828936 Bytes	3887	5729	2836034608	RGB	8	600	asu06600000420004001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1150	1150	1151.jp2	/asu0660/image/1151.jp2

But before the dark comes is a pastel blue sky with chalky pink  clouds puffing over ward. When the humidity is low you can see more;  but when the humidity is high, New York in summer is as bad as  anywhere else; you see less and smell more, smell the garbage, smell  the mesquite exhausts from the cafes downstairs; smell all the indistinguishable unmentionables that make for urban revulsion. You  smell the garbage, and hear the army of garbage trucks that preys  ceaselessly, but ineffectually, on the refuse. They are implacable, those  euphemistically white leviathans crying HA-RUMMM, HA-RUMMM  all day and all night, accompanied, for relief, by a frequent overachiever  car alarm. At night I turn on my fan, to mitigate, obfuscate,  ameliorate—i.e. to fool myself. HA-RUMMMMM indeed!  June 13, 1989  The photos of your neat house, and of its formidable dweller, delight  me. The enclosed, from today's Times, circled in red may convey a  sense of my own quarters: a view shot from West Street (near the river)  looking east. You can see Edward Albee's Harrison Street loft, across  from me. How strange now to see, a few blocks south, new payphones  and condos in lots where we once walked our dogs among wild  chamomile weeds. Perhaps a sign of middle age in this faint and abstract  anxiety — born of nostalgia? Or this article on development in the New  York Times? For when Tribeca was young—when ships slid past my  windows, blasting salutes, commencing ocean voyages; when streets  were dead-still by dusk; before any school or supermarket came; when  the restaurants were bars that stayed open after hours, and coffee-shops  that closed after lunch; when the view of the Hudson was wide, costless,  serendipitous, ready-made: I was still young too ....  April 23, 1990  I prefer to letterwrite on rainy days—however, the last time the  streets were suitably amphibious—the trash baskets filled with skeletal,  extirpative umbrella spokes (reminiscent of the species of dinosaur birds  only nine-year-olds can name)—I was under pressure of some  flagellating deadline. Unaccountably a steely, precisionist, congested  urban sky squires me to a mood engorged with descriptions. And in  that mentally priapic condition a letter may be launched of somewhat  more interest than the ilk that began "Received yours of the 15th with  great interest/delight/guilt" or "Hi there! It's been a while!" or "Sorry  it's taken so long to reply ..." etc.  No, the sun is blazing with spring fever.

Along Canal Street, Nancy Whiskey Pub and Four Roses  are in full happy-hour bloom (have been all day actually); also in the  backrooms of auto-parts shops and in unmentionable storefronts of  brick and copper flashing that sell $3.99 x-rated videos (suggested name  PORNMORE). In midtown for sure, eternally dark hotel bars brim  as businessmen inevitably stave off facing the Lincoln Tunnel. And uptown, certainly, even as I think it, rocks are discreetly dropping into  crystal goblets etched with monograms. Speaking of uptown, I never  go there save to visit the Museum. And no ancient statue is more exquisite (as in pain) than those right on Eighty-second and Madison,  in the forms of eviscerated matrons weighed down with thick cirques  and torques of beaten gold, clutching coutured dogs small enough to  groom with an eyebrow brush or a moustache comb. Why is it that  rich folk fancy teensy canines with long, straight, ash-platinum fur,  while the poor are stuck with (or rather, to) stiff-fuzz, bald, bow-legged,  gimp-pawed, goatwhite mites with trickling Chaney eyes, and smell (the  dogs, that is) rancid as the yellow-and-brown tenement stoops upon  which they live? But rich dog or poor, they all use raincoats: the London Fog-Dog kind or the kind made ad hoc from plastic wrap—  depending on their p[i]ed-igree-a-terre.  Unless you don't want to encourage that "hopelessly sentimental  child of the sixties" who once had a crush on you, who was rapturous  enough to mail you "Of Love and Hope," please pass on my cards  to her. She will love this interpretation of Vincent's bed! Now, I know  you don't approve of this art form ("dollhousedom and Rilke dollplay"  indeed!), i.e., miniatures, but I'm "into it" for now. The final one (for  I do want to resume painting, having foresaken all respectability this  winter with the onset of miniaturitis)—the final one is a miniature subway platform, the components of which—grates, tracks, stairs,  tollbooth, turnstiles, tunnels, etc.—mostly come from the streets. Any  interesting rusted thing I might find along the truck routes (the  nonresidentiality of which encourages the disembarrassed to walk their  dogs there, in the isolate gloom, now that the chamomile lots (those  dogruns often years past) have evolved into condos and parking lots).  Other than the filth of this practice, it is very much like beach combing. Every day the waves from construction or traffic throw up new  treasures for me to contemplate. I also frequent the job lot stores that  sell odd lots of anything from overstock garden hoses and car alarms,  to Taiwanesque espadrilles and mandarin-length press-on nails, to brass  decanters and toilet seats.

I'm going to go for some quick, cheap, nearby culture."  On atrophied legs I staggered to the World Financial Center—  wearing, mind you, the shapeless, morgue-green T-shirt I slept in the  night before and huge, pink, unsocial pants with soiled pockets. It was  elegant old Rush Hour at the glass-dome, palm-filled Winter Garden.  Under the enormous, intimidatious dome, zounds of young Brooks-  Brothers and -Sisters with leather briefcases (monogrammed need it be  said), precision haircuts & polished shoes zoomed about in bods designed by Nautilus Machines.  I eased into a chintz-and-rattan seat at the Palm Court with a companionable $3.50 glass of Blush and a soft Bach triple harpsichord concerto (soon seeing double, hearing triple), watching, till the sun sank,  the yachts park. Or watching, till the sun parked, the yachts sink. Then  I went to Rizzoli, right on the plaza there, where the music was imported French rock (very sexy!), to indulge in vicarious varietal art-  book thrills. I saw the new biography on Coleridge, which contains  many portraits, his mouth always catching flies: S.T.C. astounded,  probably, by bloody suns at noon ....  Enclosed, pictures of the last two miniatures. You can't see the rats  in the subway tracks, but they're there. Also a half-eaten salami-on-  roll and leaky jelly donut, plus spilled container of beige chicken soup.  Lights and speakers are faucet filters. Turnstiles are Bic lighters. Tunnel arches are orthodontia molds. The gates are heater-filter parts, and  the clock is my former watch, a Swatch-Watch. Now I wear a $3 Batman job from Chinatown—hey, the art's more important than my wrist.  I know what you're thinking, though: Slick! Bohemian! Pah!  March 26, 1991  One advantage to the endless burden of a heavy winter coat—it hides  evidence of physical sloth. Appalling, how conformist flesh is, and how  hard to defy time and gravity, those vicious despot-twins. Well I do  my bit in a nearby workout studio where many bodies, newer and shinier  than this, beat respective systems with a kind of competing and almost  contagious avidity. One instructor entertains by means of peculiar diction. Her hair ornaments, makeup and earrings indicate a Lon-Goyland  provenance. "Wun! Chew! Tree! Fah!" and "Ope! Ope! Ope!"

Over the years in the gym, among its constituents, through thick  and thin, the sartorial styles have changed—ballet leotards and tights  gave way to Spandex running suits, which were replaced by bicycle pants  and muscle-tees. Now it's calf-length leggings and scanty patterned  leotards, cut as high on the hips as jock straps. (I know about those  critters from one long-ago summer day at Fire Island, where jockstraps  accessorized the gay beach.)  Enclosed, pictures of the latest miniature, a television studio. The  formal card shows only the "staged" views. The print shows one of  several "backstage" views. To the right of the craft services table you  can see a camera and light (dolly, track, cable) and to the left, the matte  painting and stills department. The coffee urn is a 2" plumbing connector. The TV camera is a 9 volt battery with some model battleship  parts glued on.  May 30, 1991  Last night, at ten P.M., there was a fire, or at least a lot of smoke,  in the subway car I occupied, which I abandoned at Penn Station. I  waited for another train on a different track. A filthy, muscled man,  his head thrown back, stroked his face with a knife; an amputee with  a quart of Bud picked at sores; and two homeless drunks indulged in  a screaming fight. Still, the subway offers its epiphanies, as when I ride  in the head car and watch through the spotty window the intestinal,  retinal passage (is the world a metaphor of the human body, or do we  metamorphose the world into the contructs we inwardly know?)—  scaped with things more wondrous than even Special Effects could  materialize: dred-lock-looping cables clinging to concave walls; cove-  scalloped ceilings pressing impossibly low, which suddenly expand into  cathedral-grand double vaults, a whale's rib cage—trackmen on catwalks signaling at the train in great, dream-slow gestures inflected by  flares—then vanish, presumably safely, into invisible holds. Between  the black passages are illumined stations-of-the-dross, each a kind of  perverse oasis with platforms, stairwells, knots of pipes, and a hard  forest of girders in unexpected hues: raspberry, celery, tangerine—that  merge again into implacable darkness . . . it's as though from station  to station the train journeys, with no regret, from one incarnation to  the next. 	asu06600000420008001							66711864 Bytes	3878	5732	3418564109	RGB	8	600	asu06600000420008001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1154	1154	1155.jp2	/asu0660/image/1155.jp2
Scraps from Tribeca					Freeman, Jane																											asu0660000042	August 1, 1991  Work has been slow all summer. I think of it as a sabbatical and  have been doing art every day, working sometimes between twelve or  fifteen hours straight. The other day I walked 2-1/2 miles and back  just to get a certain kind of glue, picking up a lot of interesting debris  along the way. The best spots are the abandoned loading docks whose  strangely cozy, derelict bays are replete with all sorts of fascinating trash.  There's often absolutely no one around — not even the derelicts. But  I make sure, before taking anything, not to disturb what might be someone's mouldy box-and-ragpaper bed. The enclosed slide is of an atypical  piece—nothing in it came from the street.  October 1, 1991  If the state of one's life is reflected by one's environs, and if you  had seen the chaos here of late, you'd realize why it's taken two months  to reply. My mania for hauling in junk—mostly electronic, plumbing  and construction-site remains—finally thwarted any charade of order.  Plus, I couldn't fit in the studio. Mind, too, has been congested with  mucilagenous impressions from recent motley jobs (all dispatched  simultaneously in a terrible rush, like bolting a smorgasbord during  a fire drill) about subjects as diverse as Marilyn Monroe, the Strasbergs,  scops owls, laughingthrushes, Denpasar, Kaziranga, Roe vs. Wade,  abortifacients, Sweet Sixteens and Local Hunks. You can imagine the  contents of my dreams. I spent yesterday sorting and tossing out (both  from room and mind), and here I am, as expunged as possible, to clutter you with words.  Enclosed, the latest post card, a miniature law office. The water  cooler, by the way, is made from a Martin's ink bottle. Those dioramas  reeking less of doll-housedom and more of the gutter are mysterious  and actually poetic.  April 14, 1992  Busy with work I "shop" after dark, finding "art supplies" in the  curb-clotting dumpsters sometimes filled with the contents of a whole  building being renovated or razed—maybe 40 years of office furniture,  curling brown ledgers—a lifetime of assiduous ciphers. Just today I  found a pile of gilt art frames, museum-quality, conveniently disassembled, which I shared with a homeless man, who needed kindling  for his outdoor fireplace. A certain refuse bin, in Soho, leans in front  of a shoji and tatami shop. One lucky night I peered under its weighty  iron lid to spy quality lacquered sticks.

Hoping he was a minimalist,  and would take minimally, I discovered him to be a crazed Dickensian  bum, scratch-bearded, wall-eyed, and filthy. "Any good wood?" I ventured. "Wood?" the ruffian barked, steadily unfurling odors. "Well,  what are you looking for?" I asked. He squinted at me with condescension and pity: "Gold, sweetheart, gold!"  *        *       *  A couple of days ago I "took a day off" (strange term) to visit a  miniature supplier in Matawan. It was good to get out in the country,  even if my bucolic respite lay just east of Newark. I got some fresh  air pollution, a glance at leafless trees & thickets of bald gray vines  that edge grassless lawns of unquaint clapboard homes at Perth Am-  boy and Rah way.  You get the Newark train at the World Trade Center, a 20-minute  ride through an amazing landscape: landfill hills of tall, parched yellow  grass basted in green with copper cables. Poles arranged in groups like  Calvary. Dispirited billboard scaffolds, the empty armature propped  against a newsprint sky. Power cables suturing the ozone in designs  as complex and as simple as a Klee drawing or a game of "cat's cradle."  It's a tableau of gas-belching, combustible structures existing wraithlike  between stricken industrial cities: Elizabeth, Bethune. Monstrous  depopulated refineries abound with scum-lidded, multi-mullioned windows that when cracked ajar form dust-stain rhombuses glinting in  glowering sunlight. Forbidding knolls of shattered glass preface  foresaken carparts packed into yards of scintillant cubes. A black  bridge, a leviathan skyway—a serious roller coaster or ferris wheel—  something out of Bladerunner—both antediluvian and futuristic. For  seconds you're cradled in a surreal complex of pitch black X's, a galaxy  of girders, above a viscous river that's busy ominously rolling in dun  corrugations—and rife with visual effluvia!  At Penn Station (Newark) I waited for the Matawan train, listening to a riot of wrens or sparrows (or chickadees, for all I knew) prattling up in the riveted steel rafters. I was enjoying the fact that the shiny,  eyelevel undersides of a basking engine seemed like animal genitals,  gelded cockworks. At the platform's vanishing point were verboten  stairs down to the tracks. I picked up stakes and spikes and lath there,  but much enticing track detritus remained beyond getting.  Finally the train scraped in and took me off. We chugged through  a linkage of idle, old, empty towns. The willows were thinking about  maybe coming into leaf, sparse tresses trailing pale pickle-juice tear-  stains.

I sat back, lullabuoyed along hilly raillands over  Lilliputia, musing on what I might buy in Matawan, to furnish some  new, private microworld of my begetting.  May 8, 1992  An overcast Friday with no demands, no phones, no interruptuses.  Fed the neighbor's cat (the only woman I know with black hair and  blond roots); made one call to a depressed friend (a latent heterosexual); ran errands carrying—like other desultory downtowners in kneeless  jeans—coffee with a hole chewed in the container lid, the better to sip-  and-stroll. Needed some barbed wire for the next miniature, a Vacant  Lot. I wonder if Graffiti Remover is peculiar to New York: Reliable  Hardware had several brands. The long-haired old guy who cut the wire,  perhaps a retired Hell's Angel, was all in black ... his neck chains  probably caused the curvature of his spine; he wore skull-&-cross ear  lavalieres & was long on tattoos but short on teeth; brittle and crach-  ety, but very polite with a callow, tenor timbre ....  I'm just finishing the subway commission for the Fifth Avenue man,  whose name, phonetically, is Beanstalk. I hope his wife has a sense of  humor; her name, though, is Helena, so I have my doubts. Someone  described their room as muted & conventional. Be that as it may, as  of next Xmas one of their custom-made library shelves will bear the  grungiest subway imaginable. The layout is such that as soon as the  hapless rider squeezes through the turnstile he's liable to fall into the  tracks. And if an oncoming train doesn't get him, the machiavellian  track trappings will.  July 27, 1992  I'm preparing for two shows in September: a new gallery sharing  an auspicious Soho block with the downtown Guggenheim and the New  Museum; and one piece in Philadelphia. I'm also planning to curate  something in Newark next year. My days are spent largely with grant  applications, unsorted slides, and half-made pieces. I have over sixty  dioramas now, all competing for space with a cache of hub caps,  lumber, industrial byproducts, etc. Tonight I found an electrical box  on my way back from a little ferry ride to Hoboken (just across the  river). I slipped inside one of the normally barricaded landfill lots (precursors to a grand riverside esplanade being built from Battery Park  at the tip of Manhattan up to about 57th Street). I tramped over grass  and sand hills, through mud and rubble and weeds and wildflowers,  over tractor parts and weathered lumber to get the box. I took it out  11 	asu06600000420013001							67324600 Bytes	3933	5704	3723035249	RGB	8	600	asu06600000420013001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1159	1159	1160.jp2	/asu0660/image/1160.jp2

It was the guilt that probably summoned the uniformed guard, a giant who bellowed "Ma'am!  Oh Ma'am!" in a voice as ominous as foghorns. Panicked, I kept walking. He followed me right out of the compound down the road, probably eager to get out of his guard-shack. Finally he caught up with me.  This is it, I thought, on the brink of fainting. He's going to arrest me.  The big guy boomed. "I saw you take that thing from the site." I babbled. "It was on the ground, and it looks like garbage to me. Doesn't  it look like garbage to you?" I must have taken the guard off guard;  he looked bemused. He took the box and examined it. Just a rusty old  thing. Finally: "This is Battery Park, lady, you can't just take things."  I said, "I'm an artist, see, and I make art out of found objects. What  do you think? Is this trash or not?" I guess I stumped him. He gave  it back, saying, "Keep it. Maybe I'll see it again ... in a museum."  I better make something good. Maybe I'll even send him an announcement to my show.  Enclosed is a picture of the vacant lot miniature. The trees are twigs  from Central Park. I knew I'd wandered onto the Bridle Path the instant I felt a particular, sudden pleasure realizing the earth and certain  falling branches had been trampled by horse hooves. Almost instantly  the blithe hunt ended when a fillip of fetlocks nearly trounced me. I  looked up to see a high horse, and a cool young proud blond princess  in jodphers and Nazi boots with a cap and a crop and a passel of disdain. Snoblisse oblige! (Have you ever noticed the complaint implicit  in the way rich young women sometimes fan themselves with their  menus in gentrified cafes?)  A-gusty-4, 1992  Looks like I've cranked up my letter-writing mode again. Now I  can't shut up. A storm's brewing, with crayon-lemon lightning looming in a tenebrous sky, dispatching the enigmatic redolence of negative  ions. Street signs clank together like Japanese wind chimes. Weather,  like birthdays, induces letters. And this birthday was especially inspiring, being both solitary and full of feeling. Right off the bat I heaved  my bones into a long yoga class guided by an adroit and emaciated  orange-garbed yogi with snake tattoos braceleting his forearms. He  could coil his body into Celtic knots. On the 40-minute walk home I  dipped into four bookstores and a few flea markets along the way,  which is another matter for another letter. New York Sundays are surely  eccentric—everything's open, people are out, but it's all contagiously  languid and desultory . . .

This brand-new tract, which they  ingeniously named Hudson Park, is landscaped with carefully incidental gardens, big minimalist sculpture (the sort them-that-know cite as  "site-specific" though these all seemed to be on loan), grassy berms  and playing fields—even a boisterous hemispheric waterfall with a lily  pond and (if I'm not mistaken) papyrus. The rest rooms are in what  looks like a winsome 19th-century boathouse. A curious stepped-up  post-modern gazebo looms off by itself, looking somewhat in a snit,  with brick columns and colossal roof beams. Conspicuous and arbitrary,  I can't imagine what it's for, except maybe to eventually weather in.  That day the wind was so powerful it seemed to make everything  flap. The river, a steely celadon, wrinkled and rumpled as a large unmade Sunday bed, was littered with insouciant sailboats puffed and  billowing (pillowing?) like linen on a line (or the Sunday Times aspread  the same capacious bed), mirroring (the boats, that is) a smattering of  manically jouncing kites.  * *        *  I ended up, predictably, under the huge geodizzying dome of the  World Financial Center, feeling as ever like a rodent in a terrarium of  palms. Or a microbe voyaging among a giant's hair shafts under a  tower-crowned cap! They keep a couple dozen giraffelike palms in there,  poor things, coddled like caged pets, emoting an air of melancholy,  as confined things do. Their fronds, while not exactly crestfallen, don't  look quite, well, chlorophyllophilic enough. I got an iced coffee and  watched the people. You can tell the New Yorkers from the visitors  by their midsummer pallidness of course, but also by a certain tentative  quality to their perching, as if they're loath to relax even on Sunday,  already wound to spring into rush hour, a mere twelve hours hence.  October 8, 1992  I go to Staten Island now and then to experience the river more  directly and to escape the noise and confinement of this passive  geometric landscape.  * *        *  At the end of leafy Battery Park, with its public sculpture and over-  explicit war memorials, juts the vast curved wreck of the old terminal,  charred from a recent fire, whose arcing facade rhymes in shape (and  once in bronze-green color) with Miss Liberty's famed crown. Nowadays  we wait below in massive, shadowy, dank, smelly limbo, a holding room  that vaunts, through the twin black breaches of its slips, the shock of  blaze-bright river views.

The pitching, flat-footed ferry is the cadmium yellow of a taxi, or  the inner yellow of a certain two-tone daffodil. It gushes off with a  great horn blast (a kind of maritime grunt) and leaves the scarred, black-  toothed pilings in a foam of wash. The air smells large, oily, and fishy.  The short ride is meditative, despite a shoe-shine hawker, an amplified  songstress, a rap-rhythm battery salesman, a beer concessionaire, and  all the other myriad souls aboard whose assorted noises are engulfed  by the boat's vibrant drone. The water is a stiff, steel-gray silk decked  with frothy boas and furbelows. Vast old Brooklyn and penalesque  Governor's Island glide by on the left. The Verazzano Bridge is etched  faintly in the distance, no bigger than an eyelash. Abruptly, just ahead,  looms a hulking barge of boxcars. (When you adjust to distance, most  nearby things seem huge!) On the right, the Statue of Liberty salutes  dreamily. Aft, the City, with its dazzling table-top clutter of chrome  and brass and steel, dwindles into a Utopian post-card image — as huge  shrill gulls ellipse and circumflex astern.  We dock in the usual clumsy way: the ferry sides wiping the dock  pilings, churning up the river like a steamboat, and shuddering graceless-  ly into its berth. The ark empties into a reverberant cathedral of damp  gloom, which has become, like the depot on Manhattan's side, an aviary  of pigeons. Out in the sun, a superb peace is present.  October 21, 1992  To get back on the track. The train to Philly catapulted out of Penn  Station (New York) last Saturday at just the right time, when tints are  vivid and shadows rich. I was sipping wince-bitter coffee black, as the  cafe car had run out of milk—and I dislike "Half and Half" (though  those silly containers do make fine miniature lamp shades). Anyway,  out in the marshes, underneath arched stone highways, the palomino-  blond weeds were dancing in quirky gooseflesh ponds. Westward, factories were smacked flat from the sun, while to the east, shadows struck  deep and pronounced; and the mighty, white, spectral oil tanks  (resembling World's Fair relics) wheeled by, slowly spinning. The sky  changed from azure-and-ermine to a fish eye of glassine. The farther  .south, the younger autumn. Newark, Metropark, Trenton, and points  between each flashed gold domes and charred spires; between cities factories; between factories, tawdry houses of fossil-skin stucco abutting  the tracks, clapboard shacks misshapen as pinch pots; a pasture of new  lumber for prefabs, laid up in A-rows; and low modern plants fixed  14 	asu06600000420016001							66787604 Bytes	3888	5724	2750426997	RGB	8	600	asu06600000420016001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1162	1162	1163.jp2	/asu0660/image/1163.jp2

But mostly, spectacular wasteland: great chalice-shaped allsorts  mounds, reeling out compositions of multiplicities—Mount  Plasticgallonjug, Mount Blackrubbertire, Mount Rustedironworks—  vivid as twisted piles of sopping wash: a continuum of interruptions,  rather like life—and the foliage!—a clean Soutine under the sky glassine:  apricot, blush, ginger, chartreuse; pollen-tawny leaves in madder-red  resting fields, ridged like mouth-roofs or ocean floors. So much forest  passed so fast the colors bled in spitfire foreground massacres. Occasionally, through a hole in the trees a glimpse, as through a tunnel:  a whole outlying farmscape rounding distantly, flow motion, as though  reflected in the deep-wood clairvoyant hand-mirror belonging to Beauty's Beast.  December 5, 1992  Soon I'll be sending you another card—probably my last, unless  I win either a grant or the lottery. The miniature on the card is a Greenwich Village coffee house with the expected earwaxen, dustladen atmosphere, where the clientele generally look as though they've been  mucilaged in place along with the dark, greasy, heavy-framed paintings  & colossal begrimed samovar (made out of that metal switch-collar-  thing a lightbulb screws into—trust me, it looks just like a miniature  samovar when you add spigot, legs, and espresso cup). Corinthian columns (wedding cake appliances) support great wooden arches (a  winerack shelf); there's a hexagonal-tile floor; brick walls; a tin ceiling. Cafe tables jam the room, infested with sugar, ashtrays, candle-  globes, newspapers & books, silverware and writing utensils; a portrait  sketch is begun; an antique lion-fountain leers; a pastry case careens  with cheese cakes, eclairs, napoleons, cannolis. The latter were made  by a friend who supplies dollhouse stores with bakery goods. Joan works  and lives in Saddle Brook, NJ in the tiny gabled stone cottage where  she was born, housebound with her crippled and dwarfed mother, who  looks just like a storybook witch, back bent like a shepherd's crook,  Spanish-mosslike hair and all. Joan, who's about 55, is a giant,  however, with Rapunzel tresses done up in complicated piles of Clairol.  Her big-boned frame navigates adeptly about the boxlike, furniture-  clotted, flounce-and-antimacassar, wallpaper and footstool rooms. Her  voice, despite true cause for silent desperation, is hearty, and her hands  incredibly huge, despite the fact that her goodies, which look absolutely  real (the tuna 8c egg salad sandwiches, cut in quarters, are secured with  toothpicks) average 1/4" apiece.

The sun shot out rays  like a cymbal, bright as a major chord; blast furnaces whistled; the bus  squealed like a diva and grunted in Brucknerian dissonance. In general,  the harmonics prevailed orchestral in hue: silver and brass, wood, ivory,  ebony . . . Never have I site-read music as fluently as I did that day!  December 17, 1992  This miniature is a typical coffee house in Greenwich Village. I did  research: i.e., sat all day drinking cappuccinos and absorbing the atmosphere, which I think I described in my last letter. The photo doesn't  show the tabletops, but each one tells a little story: a table of art history  books; a table of tabloids; some with half eaten sandwiches and pastries,  etc.  One of my greatest sources for junk, an antique hardware-odd-lots  store, is closing after 90 years. The owner, who took over from his father  and grandfather, let me explore all four upper stories, which were filled  with stuff, floor to 12-foot ceiling, with only hairline margins between  the stacks to walk through. I had to use a flashlight, and got quite filthy,  but found great things for new miniatures — for example, I began an  eerie setting of complex machinery, like a miniature boiler room with  an elevator gear-cage and barred spaces—some place no one but rats  would like to be.  We had quite a wild storm this week—the coastal people suffered  when the rivers overflowed all the banks. The rain then turned into  snow. I went out to hear the singular stealth of flakes touching down.  Nothing sounds quite like it—maybe crabs shifting shells, tinking  hermitages—or, in a chance lull, cat talons ticking on tile. In the midst  of the flurries, white steam billowed from manholes like fog from  cauldrons, perishing the flakes, a pretty sight, but the snow didn't stick;  the many rain-drains were soon rushing. I felt sorry for a million pigeons  huddled flash-frozen high in the eaves. The atmosphere stayed veiled,  drawing out faint fog horns from nearer-by than one would suppose.  February 17, 1993  The enclosed card shows the San Remo, a great apartment building  on Central Park West I've long admired. A former Miamian, Hubert  Saal, requested a little replica for his friend Misha Dichter, the pianist,  who lives there.

Reconstructing a fragment of Central Park was a breeze,  using, among other things (schist from the Park, etc.), the roots of  Mom's 30-year-old oak that went over in Hurricane Andrew. But I had  a problem finding a late-model white Jaguar sedan. After searching  hobby shops in New York and Jersey, I finally ordered a mini Jag from  Spain, via the Midwest; and another from a store catalog that took  a month to get here—via another midwestern distributor—from Germany. The cars arrived in every color but white, so I bought 3 kinds  of white paint and tried-and-erred until I got the right bright white auto  finish. Now Misha's Jag is angling down the transverse opposite the  half-sunken rowboat on the left, which appears to be filling with snow.  The midtown hobby shops are like old-boys' clubs whose staffs,  by tacit consent and ancient habit, snub females and treat them (me)  with amplified, almost comic scorn. In the Red Caboose some guy uttered a mild oath and was sarcastically admonished: "Watch your  language, there's a lady here." The old boys all have dirty fingernails,  greasy hair, smeared glasses and fusty clothes. The shops are so clotted with merchandise you have to crab-walk in the track-thin aisles ....  I escaped that stale, finite world into the larger fantasy of Times  Square, where evening was just dusking. The sky was still very light,  like an airgram; but the blocks had grown incongruously ashy, like a  Magritte—ubiquitous street lamps, fluorescent office lights, and shrill  neon breeding avidly like fireflies in the gloom. I walked a particularly  dejected side street lined with low-level theaters (whose baroque facades  themselves looked like stage sets) and gaping unadorned public garages  disgorging prurient effulgences: from that unexpected vantage came  the peculiar tang of seeing both the Chrysler and Empire State buildings,  in reality avenues apart, brandishing dual cruel jeweled syringes at the  wan-complected, thin-skinned, slowly surrendering sky.

Flickering,  it mimes the very lightning  flashing out in the rain.  The walls all lean and bend,  the balusters dizzy on the stair  as if hard at sea in a sea wind.  A chipped brick props the roof  door at its squealing hinge,  cracks it open like a heavy  tome. You can nearly read  the font of the rain  spiraling across the door.  Crumbling griphons crouch  in other parapets.  Falling downtown awnings  still umbrella waning docks  and fluted iron pillars.  The ancient paving stones  pucker roads into islands  with grids of rivulets.  And horse hooves echo  in these evenings yet.  Uptown, I know,  (where rainy buildings  are less like damp cardboard  and more like evening shirts),  museum fountains pulse  in low rows of white-blue—  pilot lights alive  in the same fine rain  of maritime horns  and brackish buoys  and cobble streets  downtown.  20 	asu06600000420022001							67378308 Bytes	3928	5716	1364054054	RGB	8	600	asu06600000420022001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1168	1168	1169.jp2	/asu0660/image/1169.jp2

The First Prize was won by  Johnny Lorenz, for two poems, "Sunday Morning" and "Living Inside." Honorable Mention went to Edward Perez, for his poem  "Sandalo."  Sunday Morning  The boy, as still as sleep,  broken by summer, hit hard by the slap  of salty heat, unconscious. I studied  his frame holding steady  as he turned in his robes, fingers shoelaced  in front of him, eyelids like tightly pressed  peach pits. At last he lost  his knees to the floor and silenced the priest.  We all felt the heat lean on our shoulders.  It made my bones shudder  to feel pebbles rolling beneath my skin.  July can do that to you. Bodies swayed  as if charmed by the wind,  but there was no wind. I felt only sweat  that glazed my eyes so that the candles looked  like blooming, blooming like  my body bloomed like flowers.

He withdrew to corners, recesses, when she entered a room,  slid away from her advances, shrugging his tiny shoulders  in revulsion. His quiet malaise  shifted, in time, to open hostile gestures  and shrieks of outrage.  When she learned she was three months pregnant,  she guessed he was jealous—  Lord, he'd known she was planted  with child  before she had the least inkling herself! As she grew close  to term, his glum moods blackened. She tried to feed him,  but he averted his face,  pushed the food aside and nipped her fingertips  sharply, once or twice—  so she quit him! Now her sister made trips  from town, daily, to monitor  his meals; but if Audrey carelessly touched, or grazed  beforehand, any food Sis ladled  into his bowl, he'd puke it up with gusto, then spatter  and bestrew his vomit all over the kitchen.

In Memory of Mike Purdy					McNeal, Archie L.																											asu0660000042	In Memory of Mike Purdy  It is hard to envision the University of Miami without Mike Purdy. She  was a part of it, from student days on through an active role in the formative days of the University Library and into its present status.  When I came to the University of Miami in February, 1952, I found an  excellent staff with strong department heads. One of these, Elizabeth Peeler,  was head of the Catalog Department in which Mike was employed.  Elizabeth provided me with a typed list of personnel in her department  with brief comment about each. She said "Mike Purdy is our authority  on South Florida and its weather, its plants, and its history." Mike was  then a clerk typist. I encouraged her to go to F. S. U. to earn her Master's  degree in the Graduate Library School. This she did, in spite of having  to sit through classes I taught in the Summer term as Visiting Professor.  I still remember a class in which reference questions were asked and the  students were expected to identify, in class, the sources for the answers.  One answer was to be found in an index called Public Affairs Information Service. Mike raised her hand and I called on her. She said, in her  slow southern drawl, "that's in P . . . A . . . I . . . S. . ." I said "For  goodness sake, Mike, that's why we abbreviate it — to get it out quicker!"  Two years ago at the ALA meeting in San Antonio, I passed the PAIS  booth in the exhibits and saw pens with the PAIS initials on them. I brought  one back to Mike.  Helen Carmichael Purdy will always be a part of the Otto G. Richter  Library. When I asked her to serve as Head of Archives and Special Collections she accepted the responsibility of a burgeoning department and  with some competent assistance began the task of organizing and developing better access and control of the collection. The Mark Boyd collection  of Floridiana, the Sir Noel Livingston Library of Jamaica and Caribbean  material, the Deering Library, and a strong emphasis on Cuban items —  these and others required a continuing effort to organize and make them  available for use.  Mike was one of those rare people — a native Miamian — and she was  deeply interested in the area. When she retired, Mike established a trust  — The Helen Carmichael Purdy Foundation. The trust will receive the bulk  of her estate and income from it will be used to enhance the Floridiana  Collection that she was instrumental in developing.  We owe a debt of gratitude to Mike for her untiring efforts and her loyalty and friendship.

Wallace Stevens' Search For Being Through The Supreme Fiction					Buhr, Marjorie																											asu0660000024	THE  CARRE LL  Volume 13 June 1972 Number 1  Wallace Stevens9  Search For Being Through  The Supreme Fiction  By Marjorie Buhr  Man has believed that he lived to search for truth but  Nietzsche pointed out that it may well be that he  existed only because of untruth or his mythologizing  faculty. Such a will to illusion William James called the will to  believe and he felt that in an increasingly destitute world, man  needs inner convictions which condition his outer religious and  artistic expressions. The more a man is committed to his illusion,  the more he accepts appearance and reality as one, the happier  he will be.  Freud and Fraser pointed out the resemblance of modern religious customs to pagan rituals and myths and dismissed all  religion as superstition. But although we may live in a more  technically advanced world with fewer basic insecurities, we cannot congratulate ourselves on our superiority to primitive man;  at least he never left his own to face the mysteries of the world  with no meaningful myth. Perhaps the very universality of those  religious practices expresses some inherent truth; if not, they  undeniably reflect man's needs and aspirations. Even when Stevens rejected dogma, he accepted psychological need: "As the  (Editor's Note: Numbers in parentheses refer to pages of Wallace  Stevens' Collected Poems. OP refers to his Opus Posthumous, NA to The  Necessary Angel, and L to the letters edited by Holly Stevens).  t    f 	asu06600000240003001							66071428 Bytes	3849	5720	2678179843	RGB	8	600	asu06600000240003001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1190	1190	1191.jp2	/asu0660/image/1191.jp2
Wallace Stevens' Search For Being Through The Supreme Fiction					Buhr, Marjorie																											asu0660000024	reason destroys, the poet must create" (OP 164). Hence he took  the search for a supreme fiction, a hymn which would be appropriate to the complexities of this world, very seriously.  Positivism considers myth, religion, and metaphysics as the  toys of a pre-scientific time, consoling man for his inability to  master the world. Now that science has almost accomplished  this mastery, its prophets argue, art's only value is emotive. If  they are right and all discussion of God and transcendence is  meaningless because it cannot be empirically verified, then the  poet of being occupies an insignificant place indeed. But Stevens  did not believe, as did Aldous Huxley, that science would produce that ultimate knowledge that would still man's spiritual  craving. God is not contained in the rational and natural; art  springs from the mystery of existence, and an insistence upon  empiricism only cripples art and paralyzes man's will to affirm  life. Bernard Shaw's "Too Good to be True" announces the  loss of man's faith in science as an ultimate concern: "The  science to which I pinned my faith is bankrupt. Its tales were  more foolish than all the miracles of the priests. . . ."  Stevens has been criticized for showing almost no acquaintance  with the history of ideas. While it is true that his philosophy is  generally eclectic, he shows a sound knowledge of that epistemo-  logical tradition which has dealt with the symbolic, mythic and  Active function of the mind as an instrument in comprehending  reality. He quotes, or mentions, James, Bergson, Kant, Cassirer,  Heidegger, Croce and numerous other philosophers who have  been influential in this tradition. A study of the history of belief  reveals, he remarks, that every fundamental belief has been expressed in the shape of a fiction (L 430). Since Stevens' search  for being and reality involved such a fiction, it deserves exploration, a complicated endeavor because of the protean form of the  fiction in his thought. Stevens himself never arrived at a satisfactory Active shaping of reality and being, but his efforts toward  this end are intriguing.  The critics have been one-sided in their treatment of Stevens'  fiction, asserting most often that he creates imaginative constructs  of the world which he knows to be untrue but which he nonetheless chooses to believe.

The confusion of the critics is understandable. Stevens used the words "belief," "illusion," and "fiction" ambiguously.  Influenced largely by their literary background, critics naturally  tend to interpret the fiction to be a figment of the imagination,  but Stevens' use of the word is not that narrow; he comprehends  that the fiction does not pertain merely to literature but to politics, science, ethics, and religion. Discussing his "Notes toward a  Supreme Fiction" with a student from Trinity College, Stevens  declared that the modern age believes many fictions. The student  disagreed; one cannot believe in something which he knows is  not true; Stevens replied that we do just that constantly. In short,  he realized that the consciously-false plays a monumental role  in our lives.  Frank Doggett has suggested that perhaps Stevens read Hans  Vaihinger's The Philosophy of the As-If. There is no proof of  this but it is certain that Stevens knew the thought of many of  the philosophers Vaihinger considered influential. The as-if construction itself appears over eighty times in Stevens' poetry.  Since only the particular is real, Vaihinger declares that all  general propositions must be based on fictions. Such fictions  must not be confused with hypotheses which express facts and  demand verification; the fiction is a figure of thought, a freely  fashioned construct which is justified by its expediency. There  are political fictions, such as the idea of Utopia, psychological  fictions such as the pretense that there is an "average man,"  mathematical fictions (the idea of empty space), metaphysical  fictions (the belief in God), scientific fictions (the atom or the  Alpha Body). Such fictions are contradictory or even untrue but  they make productive thought possible.  Critics of the fiction suggest that it is a regression to a childlike or primitive state but, on the contrary, it appears only in  the highest state of man's development, when he is emancipated  from immediate perception and the naive belief that thought and  reality are identical. The erroneous belief that man can understand the world or attain final knowledge, Vaihinger calls logical 	asu06600000240005001							66163368 Bytes	3876	5688	644079055	RGB	8	600	asu06600000240005001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1192	1192	1193.jp2	/asu0660/image/1193.jp2

The logical optimist makes the same mistake the primitive savage made when he objectified creations. Such an error  leads to the dogmatism of Stevens' high-toned old Christian  woman who entertains no suspicion that her absolute truth may  merely arouse merriment in higher powers. But a materialistic  cynicism which denies any validity to metaphysics is equally  barren; such thinkers wipe away "moonlight like mud" and their  "no and no made yes impossible" (249). Stevens asserts that  the great cultures have regarded myths as myths and yet esteemed  them for their aesthetic and ethical values.  The fiction as an ontological expression of the twentieth century's effort to find a meaningful substitute for a religious tradition which had lost its vitality (largely because of a dogma  which insisted that religious fictions are literally true) was Stevens' lifelong absorption. French symbolist poetry, art, and philosophy undoubtedly influenced him in this concern. As Marcel  Raymond points out (in a book Stevens praised), poetry was  for the symbolists an activity in which the soul seeks to regain  its lost Eden; Baudelaire's correspondences are fabulous constructs which common sense may declare to be untrue, but which  are psychologically true because, on an imaginative level, they  correspond to the feelings and thoughts which engendered them.  Baudelaire refers to his art in Salon de 1859 as "la plus haute  fiction." Mallarme, haunted by the incoherence of the world and  the devastating knowledge that the Absolute lives in lonely peaks  never to be reached by man, felt that man becomes great when  he faces his nothingness and creates God in a "Glorious Fiction."  Realizing that we would perish if fables, myths, games, monsters,  and metaphysics did not people the darkness of our nature with  abstractions, such painters as Picasso and Bonnard declared that  art consists of "more or less convincing lies." The works of the  popular French essayist Alain (whose complete works Stevens  owned) referred to the imaginative construct as an erroneous  perception, forever colored by the artist's feelings. Since emotions  are simultaneously the primary source of error in human perception as well as the source of all creative activity, art must be  literally false. "It is an artificial world" (252) in which the artist  embraces illusion willingly in a game in which one chooses "to  play the imagined pine/The imagined jay" (184). 	asu06600000240006001							66023804 Bytes	3857	5704	3433832865	RGB	8	600	asu06600000240006001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1193	1193	1194.jp2	/asu0660/image/1194.jp2
Wallace Stevens' Search For Being Through The Supreme Fiction					Buhr, Marjorie																											asu0660000024	The fiction becomes more than a game, however, when it  involves a life-furthering psychic activity. James, Nietzsche,  Bergson, and Jung are not as concerned with the truth or falsity  of the myth as they are with its vital function as a preservative  of life. The discoveries of modern psychology gave considerable  status to the myth; it was no longer possible for any informed  person to congratulate himself on having surpassed the beliefs  of primitive people, since twentieth-century studies have demonstrated that the impulse toward the mythic is universal and timeless. Jung criticized the scientifically oriented for their arrogance  in declaring that the gods of heathens were illusions and for pretending that what modern man calls "real" is not equally full of  illusion. Accused of mysticism for asserting that symbolic language surpasses factual language in quality and strength, he  asserted that he is not responsible for the fact that the human  psyche from time immemorial has been shot through with religious feelings and ideas which express themselves in universal  primordial mythic archetypes.  Man, as the only creature who is capable of recognizing his  alienation from being and nature, who comprehends his contingency, and who reasons about death and nothingness, finds  the question "How shall we face the edge of time?" (OP 66) a  crucial one as other animals do not. Nietzsche thought it part  of the questionable and terrible order of existence that man must  invent in order to survive, that he must protect himself against  the Apollonian rationalistic forces by cultivating the Dionysian  intuitive forces. While Stevens is not so pessimistic as Nietzsche,  who he felt invented the "dark night of the soul" (L 863),  the fact that life is impossible without the imagination finds continual expression in his poetry. When man no longer believes  in past dogma, he cannot merely disbelieve; he must create or  choose a vital belief.  Here in the west indifferent crickets chant  Through our indifferent crises.

All  other creatures drink greedily from the cup of life, licking off  the honey which nature smears on the rim. Intelligence enables  man to peer to the bottom where he finds death, and it is only  the myth-making faculty that protects him against the lucidity  of the intelligence. To a century aware of Freud's interpretation  of religion as wish fulfillment and childish illusion, Bergson's  assertion that the non-rational aspects of experience, whether  expressed in theology or art, are not primitive explanations of  experience but valid functions of the myth-making function in  man, was welcome. The pragmatic necessity for myth is apparent  and it is small wonder that James saw in him a kindred spirit,  for he acknowledged that man has a right to believe in ideas  which fulfill the heart's need if only to make life more worth  living (although he did not claim, like James, that the true and  the useful are one).  Whatever consolations Stevens found in the "honey of life,"  it is still the knowledge of death which "terrifies one for a time  and overwhelms us with its solitude" (L 497). Man perceives  that the "aspic nipples" of mother nature only occasionally vent  honey and that he must defend himself against the dissolvent  powers of the intelligence, the "cold vacancy" that results when  one discovers that there is no "imperishable bliss." The imaginative faculty of the mind is the only force potent enough to  protect us against the conceptualizing force of the mind:  The mind is the terriblest force in the world, father,  Because, in chief, it, only, can defend  Against itself. At its mercy, we depend  Upon it. (436)  Only with the aid of the myth-making faculty can we nourish  ourselves against reality and create fictions which instill an "indifference to deeper death" (399). After the death of his close  friend Henry Church, Stevens wrote a mythology of modern  death in which the forms which represent death and with which  one meets death are not unnatural or "abortive figures" even  though they "live without light." Instead they are "death's own  supremest images," created by a mind which is like a child that  sings itself to sleep "among the creatures that it makes . . . those  by which it lives and dies" (436). 	asu06600000240008001							66583296 Bytes	3889	5705	1515071919	RGB	8	600	asu06600000240008001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1195	1195	1196.jp2	/asu0660/image/1196.jp2
Wallace Stevens' Search For Being Through The Supreme Fiction					Buhr, Marjorie																											asu0660000024	William James's celebrated doctrine of the will to believe  was the most powerful influence on Stevens' own "Notes toward  a Supreme Fiction," a fact which he acknowledges to an old classmate when he considers the fuss being made over his declaration  that we believe the untrue. People should readily realize that we  yield ourselves to a "declared fiction . . . out of the need to believe, what in your day and mine, in Cambridge, was called the  will to believe" (L 443).  It is the willingness to act on a conjecture which makes that  conjecture vital for James. Certain areas of life have always been  mysterious, but we cannot remain scientifically detached until  all proofs come in. In many important transactions of life, we  have to take a leap into the dark. If there are facts into which  an element of subjectivity enters, they call for a faith which may  actually help to create the fact. So far as a man is productive or  original, his entire vital function may be said to deal with "may-  be's," or the "method of belief based on desire." James's philosophic quest was never dispassionate but undertaken with hope  and fear, and he scoffs at philosophers who pretend that they  are "objective," that their philosophy has been constructed without the help of personal preference or belief. The mind primarily  serves a teleological function and it acts for the sake of ends  that may not exist at all in the physical world but only in a  subjective one.  Stevens' most vital concern in life was the search for James's  live hypothesis in which he could willingly believe. Because it  is the poet's duty to affirm, to create confidence in the world,  the "question of illusion as value" (L 431) was his constant preoccupation. If the center of being that he sought was a "state of  mind, nothing more . . . ," he feels, like James, that a volitional  act can enable him to choose the most affirmative "as if" world.  If the world is plastic, if there is no heaven of eternal created  essences but only a world of changing values partially created  by the mind, then its successful creation depends on man's belief  in it. James's emphasis on the "heroic will" doubtless influenced  Stevens' belief that those who realize that the "ideal and the real  are dynamically continuous are those by whom the world is to  be saved" (OP 251).

James, like many another modern thinker, felt that the dualism  between religion and science could create an anguish which  might well lead man to suicide. To combat such despair, we  have the right to believe that experienced reality is only part  of a larger whole, even though there is no empirical proof for  this illusion. We can act as if there is a god, feel as if we are free;  if reason does not support such a belief, intuition does. Some  living moments have something of the absolute that need no  lateral support; their meaning seems to well up from their very  center, in a way impossible to describe. But such moments contain and sum up all things. James scorns the scientific hubris  that attempts to establish matter as the consummation of things.  Our "god-like powers of insight" can never be subservient to a  materialistic world; it is in our "wonderful inward consciousness"  that the greatest harvest is reaped. Even science is a fiction  created by man to satisfy his craving for coherence; his subjective reactions are every bit as actual and "objective" as any  part of reality.  Acknowledging that the brute world in its total bleakness is  a baffling experience for the poet, Stevens speaks of the subjective desire to "contain the world wholly within one's own perception of it" (L 501). The despair that religious contradiction  can create, Stevens describes in "that tortured one,/So destitute  that nothing but herself/Remained and nothing of herself except  a fear . . ." (OP 44). The world needs the poet to help it rise  above such fear and bleakness; but the poet must believe in  poetry or he cannot write it. If we measure the greatness of man  by his art, then it is only his will to "believe beyond belief" that  has made him modern and will keep him so (OP 202).

The whole race is a poet that writes down  The eccentric propositions of its fate. (356)  In the area of metaphysics man is faced with more contradictions and antinomies than in any other field of knowledge, and  there the most harm is done by the insistence on absolute "belief."  The fiction is an analogue which organizes experience in order  to attain metaphysical truth, but such truth is never ultimate but,  rather, heuristic in nature. The "single certain truth" is fatal to  the truth itself (381). The insistence on the necessity for belief  in an absolute sense has done so much damage that modern  theologians, such as Niebuhr and Tillich, would do away with  the word belief in any connection but the scientific and historic.  A man believes facts or scientific formulas but has faith in symbols or myths because he participates in them with his whole  being. To those who answer that no one can believe in myth  or symbol, they reply that such individuals fail to understand  the power of symbolic language. "We are deceivers yet true,"  Niebuhr states, and explains this paradox by reference to art;  the artist lies or portrays falsely when he shows perspective or  depth on a flat surface, and yet his picture is more "true" for  its falsity. Symbols which express metaphysical truths, such as  are used in the story of the loss of Eden, may not be literally  true, yet they possess mythic truth. Only the most unsophisticated  have sought for literal truth, according to Vaihinger. When  Christ spoke of God as father, he meant that God should be  regarded as if he were a father. When he spoke of his body and  blood at the Last Supper, he meant that his followers should  regard the wafer and wine as if they were his body and blood.  Many of Christ's followers, unfortunately, have petrified his symbolic insights into absolute dogma. The relationship of God to  the world, which is completely unknowable, can be conceived  fruitfully only in analogical terms. The logical optimist holds  that the analogies are actual truth, the logical positivist that they  are valueless. Stevens steers a middle course, feeling that while  science can classify, define and analyze, it is the intuitive which  deals in symbolic truths and thus creates values which escape even  the cold scrutiny of logical positivism.

Wallace Stevens' Search For Being Through The Supreme Fiction					Buhr, Marjorie																											asu0660000024	its dogma is factual, it is false; portrayed in poetry and myth, it  remains expressive of man's deepest needs. But the logical posi-  tivist who insists that only the empirically proven has meaning  is equally (with the theologian who insists that his creed be accepted as absolute truth) a lunatic of one idea in a world of ideas.  Effendi, he  That has lost the folly of the moon becomes  The prince of the proverbs of pure poverty.  To lose sensibility, to see what one sees,  As if sight had not its own miraculous thrift,  To hear only what one hears, one meaning alone,  As if the paradise of meaning ceased  To be paradise, it is this to be destitute. (320)  Stevens quotes Whitehead approvingly to the effect that aesthetics have been understood in too restricted a sense (OP 230).  Art, according to Whitehead, disclosing the very meaning of life,  is more than a fortuitous, ornamental addition to the world. The  "great elemental truths" speak through the artist who interprets  our best moments, and the relevance of "untrue propositions" is  significantly disclosed by art, romance, and ideals. The greatest  period of Greek creation occurred after the breakdown of old  dogmas. Ceasing to believe in the gods as literal forms, the  Greeks saw that they served useful purposes as symbols. What  they lost in childlike faith, they gained in the universal connotations of poetry and symbol. If the aesthetic order is derived from  the continued immanence of God, as Whitehead believed, then  the poet is the "potent figure" that Stevens calls him, whose  description is "revelation." He is not a mere ornament to society  but seeks to have such insights into reality as will make it possible  for him to be a poet at the very "center of consciousness"  (NA155).  The idea of expressing the Transcendent in a fiction may seem  unsophisticated but, according to Vaihinger, the myth which  deals with Being occurs only at the highest stage of human development, since it operates largely with constructs that are not  only opposed to facts but are self-contradictory. Only the most  highly developed intelligence can embrace antinomies; thus Vaihinger feels that Kant's contributions to the idea of God as a  fiction are of the greatest value.

Wallace Stevens' Search For Being Through The Supreme Fiction					Buhr, Marjorie																											asu0660000024	idea of a supreme reality itself, according to Kant, are "natural  illusions." The word "illusion" has a pejorative connotation in  a scientific century, but Kant means that we can speak about the  world as a coherent whole only if we philosophize as if there  were a necessary first cause. Illusions are not harmful so long as  their heuristic function is understood. Of a "thought-entity" we  can predicate nothing further, yet we may consider it to have a  relationship to the phenomenal world. Kant therefore postulates  a God who symbolizes the highest perfection in the world and  considers the cosmic whole as if it were the ordering of supreme  reason. If our categories of thought are fallible and our metaphysics exist only by way of analogy, we must imagine the world  as if it exists and as if its character and our being are derived  from God. If one conceives of the self as a transcendent idea,  rather than as an object of experience, then the self orders natural  knowledge. Stevens feels no need to be as consistent as Kant and  he plays poetically with the concept of whether the self discovers  or invents reality. Perhaps reality imposes its world upon the  self, the "night makes everything grotesque." In "Description  without Place," Stevens shows Nietzsche creating his own dark  world:  His revery was the deepness of the pool,  The very pool, his thoughts the colored forms,  The eccentric souvenirs of human shapes,  Wrapped in their seemings, crowd on curious crowd,  In a kind of total affluence, all first,  All final, colors subjected in revery  To an innate grandiose, an innate light,  The sun of Nietzsche gildering the pool,  Yes: gildering the swarm-like manias  In perpetual revolution, round and round . . . (342)  Stevens was growing to intellectual awareness at the time  when Oscar Wilde's "The Decay of Lying" declared that art's  chief function is falsity, when Yeats' masks and Nietzsche's philosophic question "Why not untruth?" were highly popular. His  interest in the value of illusion never flagged. But one notices  a growing tendency toward self-interrogation on this point; has  he lived, he asks, a skeleton's life as a "disbeliever in reality?"  (OP 117). The world had been real for him once only if he  made it so, but he had always disliked the pejorative connotation  11   • 	asu06600000240013001							67032956 Bytes	3905	5720	1733396920	RGB	8	600	asu06600000240013001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1200	1200	1201.jp2	/asu0660/image/1201.jp2

Poetry became more for him  than the "powerful mirror of his wish and will . . ." (246).  Perhaps there is a real, "hidden and alive," behind the unreal,  or perhaps the real and the unreal are "two in one" (485).  Reflecting that the history of belief has always taken the shape  of a fiction, he remarked that this seems to be a "paradox"  (L 370). Reflecting further on the nature of this puzzle, his later  poetry modifies his earlier assumption that it is an artificial world  on which man deliberately imposes a pattern. Perhaps it is a world  which man discovers. It is possible that the real will come from  its "crude compoundings . . ." that man will "discover an order  as of a season" rather than imposing it (404). The greatest geniuses, Stevens noted, are those who see the real and the unreal  as two in one, who combine a "passion for reality" with an interest in the metaphysical (L 597).  One can only speculate on the reasons for this change, but it  is not a radical reorientation; Stevens had always desired a reconciliation between the abstract and the concrete, the object  and its meaning. Doubtless he was drawn to such philosophers  as his friend, Jean Wahl, who believed, with the phenomenologists and the existentialists, that a distinction between the real  and the unreal, like the Cartesian dualism between the subject  and the object, is metaphysically primitive. Wahl had an especially high opinion of Maurice Merleau-Ponty and his "very  significant" book The Phenomenology of Perception, in which  Merleau-Ponty asserts that there is a fluid transition from the  world of poetry and dreams, of the unconscious and symbolic,  to the world of objective reality. He cannot separate the task of  literature and philosophy in a world in which man no longer  explains but rather formulates an experience with the world which  precedes all thought about it: "If I have an experience of the  real as of the imaginary, then the problem becomes one of primary perception, how to describe my perception of the world  as that upon which my idea of the truth is forever based." Or  as Stevens puts it: "The truth seems to be that we live in concepts of the imagination before the reason has established them"  (NA 154). Hence it is unfair to blame myth for the fact that  it does not explain the world.

The level of this tide at each  moment conditions a space peopled with phantasm, just as in  waking life, our dealing with the world which is offered to us  conditions a space peopled with realities. We tend towards this  landmark as towards the natural abode of certain peace or joy   Stevens peoples the precious "non-geography" of his mind  with such phantasms. Such descriptions without place may not  exist in physical space but they are nonetheless real. Although  Stevens has never been to the geographic place named Paris,  he lives "in a Paris that has never existed and that is composed  of the things that other people . . . have said about Paris." Admittedly such a Paris is unreal; it is still a "precious fiction"  (L 773). If one finds intimations of immortality in an object on  the mantelpiece, these "intimations are as real in the mind in  which they occur as the mantelpiece itself" (NA 75).  Cognitive thought from Plato to James has seen the importance of symbol as an instrument for grasping reality, but the  belief that a symbolic relationship is the only possible way to  perceive the world is distinctively modern, a view that owes  much to such a comparative linguist as Ernest Cassirer. When  reality was conceived as something tangible and literally given,  it was the task of language to reflect this reality, but, unfortunately, it could never adequately mirror this reality; all art had  to be illusive, an imitation which forever fell short of the actual.  Such naive realism, according to Cassirer, has been transcended,  and, instead of measuring the content and truth of intellectual  forms by something extraneous which is supposed to be reproduced in them, man must find in the forms themselves truth and  intrinsic meaning. In this view, myth and science are equally  expressed by symbols, not as allegorical renderings, but as processes which produce a world of their own. To ask what reality  13  • 	asu06600000240015001							66561180 Bytes	3864	5740	748052417	RGB	8	600	asu06600000240015001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1202	1202	1203.jp2	/asu0660/image/1203.jp2

Since Stevens had always been interested in how ideas fuse  with the structure of things, such a thinker quite naturally interested him. He quotes Cassirer to the effect that poetry, transcending its past role as imaginative activity, now has a "universal  metaphysical value," and that it is the poetic imagination which  is the "only clue to reality" (NA 136). Yet, admitting that such  absolute idealism must be attractive to the imaginative man,  Stevens still cannot fully accept it, for alas, there is the logical  positivist, A. J. Ayer, to tell us how meaningless metaphysics is.  These two extremes of idealism and materialism illustrate Stevens' dilemma. He would like to believe that the "word is the  making of the world" (345), but he is very well aware that  abstractions (such as those about God) can become meaningless.  But in spite of the difficulty, he must affirm the vitality of poetry  as metaphysics. "If the imagination is the faculty by which we  import the unreal into what is real, its value is the value of the  way of thinking by which we project the idea of God into the  idea of man" (NA 150). That his own supreme fiction was such  an attempt is beyond doubt—indeed its implications could "occupy a school of rabbis for the next few generations" (L 435).  "It is not enough to cover the rock with leaves," Stevens wrote  when he was past seventy, acknowledging that it was no longer  sufficient for him to choose a fiction and impose it on the brute  world as leaves cover the rock. If reality is composed of the  whole variety and abundance of the symbolic forms of life, as  Cassirer felt, then the poet must make "meanings of the rock,/Of  such mixed motion and such imagery/That its barrenness becomes a thousand things/And so exists no more" (527).  Ernest Cassirer asserts in his study of Goethe and Rousseau  that all great geniuses have sought a solution to the eternal problem of Being and that the desire to attain Being is the measure  of man's greatness. But if Tillich is right in his evaluation of our  age as one of "broken symbols," the task of the poet of Being  becomes insuperably difficult.  The two great poets of Being that America has produced are  Eliot and Stevens, although they have opposing viewpoints on  •  14 	asu06600000240016001							66752696 Bytes	3888	5721	1913539056	RGB	8	600	asu06600000240016001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1203	1203	1204.jp2	/asu0660/image/1204.jp2
Wallace Stevens' Search For Being Through The Supreme Fiction					Buhr, Marjorie																											asu0660000024	dogma. Eliot feels that man must kneel where prayer once was  valid and find the still point in a changing world. Stevens rejects  tradition; the church is a curious relic but the search for a supreme fiction through which man's relation to Being could be  expressed remained of paramount importance to him— " . . .  the Active abstract is as immanent in the mind of the poet as the  idea of God is immanent in the mind of the theologian" (L 434).  Eliot sees man as a weak and sinful creature whose only hope  is to place his faith in that hint half understood—the Incarnation;  Stevens rejects a religion which would weaken man's will to  affirm this world. His problem is rather to relate to Being meaningfully and participate in the creativity of the ongoing universe.  Eliot's hero is Dante, the portrayer of a coherent and harmonious  world—Stevens' hero is the planter in "Notes toward a Supreme  Fiction" who, after objective certainty is gone, still clings to a  illusion which pierces him. No Dante or Milton, Stevens does  not wish to justify the ways of God to man, nor to establish  God in his heaven. In his search for a "fresh spiritual," Stevens  illustrates the difficulties of conventional belief in an age which,  as Heidegger says, has come too late for the gods but too early  for Being. If man cannot catch Being in a trap of words, then  he must discard his broken symbols and return again and again  to a new expression of his perceptions: "The first word would  be of the susceptible being arrived/The immaculate disclosure  of the secret no longer obscured" (OP 96). When Being, consciousness, and the natural world do not merely make contact  but fuse, then life and poetry become one and Stevens lives on  the metaphysical streets of a physical town where the real and  the unreal, the credible and the incredible, the known and the  unknown merge into one. In one of his last poems, Stevens examines that "intensest rendezvous" which results when man,  Being, and the supreme fiction are reconciled:  We say God and the imagination are one . . .  How high that highest candle lights the dark.

The Wallace Stevens Collection At The University of Miami					Riffey, Madeline S.																											asu0660000024	The Wallace Stevens Collection  At The University Of Miami  By Madeline S. Riffey  For twenty years prior to his death in 1969, Charles Lewis Morgan was  Acquisitions Librarian at the University of Miami Library and in 1967  he became its Assistant Director for Special Collections. From a memorial  fund in his honor the Library has subsequently augmented the original  Morgan gift of Wallace Stevens. Currently the collection has 233 items.  Editor's Note.  Any copy of a book which he admired, even a paperback,  was sufficient for Lewis Morgan's personal library, excepting the work of Wallace Stevens. Collecting first  editions, particularly limited and signed first editions, books and  periodicals which included work by Stevens, as well as criticism  of Stevens' work in books and periodicals was a great pleasure  to Mr. Morgan. By 1963 he had given 95 items, including all  of the rare ones in his collection, to the Library.  The Morse, Bryer, Riddel checklist of Wallace Stevens' work  lists 23 books and pamphlets, and Mr. Morgan's collection includes editions of all except one. It is Epitaphiana which was  printed ". . . in an edition of not more than ten (probably fewer)  copies. . . ."  Ideas of Order, OwTs Clover, Three Academic Pieces and  Esthetique du Mai are among the limited and signed editions.  There are multiple copies of some titles such as Ideas of Order,  including the first edition and the first ordinary edition as well  as the signed copy. Various printings and bindings are represented with several copies for titles such as Harmonium, and the  pamphlet, A Primitive Like an Orb.  There are a number of anthologies. The oldest is Harvard  Lyrics and Other Verses: Being Selections of the Best Verse  Written by Harvard Undergraduates Within the Last Ten Years  (Boston, Brown, 1899), which includes Stevens' first published  poem. Alfred Kreymborg edited Others for 1917 and Others for  1919. Both were anthologies of new verse which published some  of Stevens' work in book form for the first time.  •  16 	asu06600000240018001							68202804 Bytes	3913	5808	2465753321	RGB	8	600	asu06600000240018001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1205	1205	1206.jp2	/asu0660/image/1206.jp2

One of the most attractive of the foreign translations of  individual titles is the copy of Esthetique du Mai in Arabic.  Many of the little magazines used Stevens' poetry long before  he was persuaded to publish his first book, Harmonium, in 1923;  and he continued to contribute to little magazines after it was  published. In the Morgan collection, these contributions are contained in issues of Hound and Horn, Wake, Origin, Pacific, Accent, Direction, Harkness Hoot, Alcestis, The Chimera, Sewanee  Review, Voices, and others. The Dartmouth College Library  Bulletin (December 1961) and the Trinity Review (May 1954)  are examples of journals which were published as tributes containing only articles and poetry by Stevens or criticism of his  work.  Prefaces by Wallace Stevens are represented in Time of Years;  a First Book of Poems, by Samuel French Morse, (Cummington,  Mass., Cummington Press, 1943) his friend and biographer. For  volume 4 of the Collected Works of Paul Valery (New York,  Pantheon Press, 1956), Stevens wrote two prefaces.  Among the unusual items is the galley proof for Stevens' Letters; Selected and Edited by Holly Stevens, (London, Faber and  Faber, 1967). There are two original letters, one to Mr. Alfred  Kreymborg dated March 8, 1923 at Hartford, Connecticut. Another interesting item is a catalog from the Parke-Bernet Galleries  titled: Costume Books with Color Plates, Finely Bound French  Works, Limited Editions and Other Books, Collected by William  Mitchell Van Winkle, the Late Wallace Stevens, and Other  Owners, (New York, 1959).  This author collection has been supplemented in recent year?  by library purchases of the numerous critical books and essays  about Stevens' work, but it exists because of Lewis Morgan's  early and continuing interest. His opinion of Wallace Stevens'  work appears in the concluding paragraph of an article which  he wrote for undergraduate students at the University of Miami:  The student who is not interested in or sympathetic with the  concept of a possible human nobility inherent in, to use a phrase  17  • 	asu06600000240019001							66868460 Bytes	3863	5768	3832223979	RGB	8	600	asu06600000240019001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1206	1206	1207.jp2	/asu0660/image/1207.jp2

Such a person  would not be well advised, however, to ignore Stevens completely. He may have been the last of the great romantics. He has  been called the only truly modern poet. In any case he thought  and he thought out loud. He enjoyed and he invited his readers  to enjoy, too, "All pleasures and all pains." Perhaps his most  important contribution was his persuasion that the poet could  provide an element "In which we pronounce joy like a word  of our own."  18  ..&lt; 	asu06600000240020001							66749364 Bytes	3905	5696	1278345504	RGB	8	600	asu06600000240020001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1207	1207	1208.jp2	/asu0660/image/1208.jp2
Philip Wylie					Muir, Helen																											asu0660000024	Philip Wylie  By Helen Muir  Philip wylie belonged to Miami. When he was away for  periods of time and then returned, it became clear that  this was so. It was as though he had never been gone.  Right away, people were knocking on his door, asking for interviews or autographs, inviting him to speak, soliciting his help  for one cause or another. Phil was a resident of Miami with  voting privileges (the last official act of his life was to register  to vote last Fall) but even if this had not been so he would still  have belonged here. He belonged to Miami because he entered  into it, served it, loved it, fought for it—and sometimes with it.  It follows that Philip Wylie also belonged to the University  of Miami which bestowed an honorary doctorate on him, an  honor well deserved and well appreciated.  When he died last October 25th—in Miami where he belonged  —a memorial service was held at the University of Miami. At  the same hour one was held at Princeton University, which had  claimed him during his undergraduate years.  At a later date, preceding the burial of his ashes, still another  service was held in the hamlet of Rushford, N. Y. In this issue  THE CARRELL brings a transcript of remarks made by Max  Wylie on that occasion.  Philip Wylie and his younger brother Max had more in common than blood ties. Each achieved his mark in the same field  as writers. They shared the same birthday, May 12th, although  born in different years. They were close friends.  The question arises, why Rushford for a family memorial  service and burial?  Phil belonged to Rushford by reason of his marriage to Fred-  erica Ballard, whose roots are well established in the soil of  western New York. While living in Rushford Phil was given the  kind of anonymity and acceptance that permitted him freedom  to work uninterruptedly, walk his standard poodle, Charlie, drop  by the post office, play his games of golf.

Philip Wylie					Muir, Helen																											asu0660000024	books, columns went on in rhythmic fashion in his comfortable  study there in the house where his wife was born and which became their official summer place. Sometimes, when he was working well, the Wylies fingered on into the cold season.  It was cold that day last November when the ashes of Philip  Gordon Wylie were put down with those of his brother Ted, a  promising young writer who died too soon.  But there was nothing cold about the memorial service which  preceded the burial. It was a homemade service with beautiful  music played by family and beautiful poetry spoken by family  and with the remarks of a bereaved brother.  The service was held in the schoolhouse because Phil, as  everybody knows, was never a card-carrying churchman. When  it was over, it was agreed that Phil would have been pleased with  the quality, the naturalness and spontaneity of the occasion. The  fact that the young participated in the event was another thing  in its favor because Phil had a vast affection for the young.  When he came to Miami for a brief visit last September, Philip  Wylie was on the verge of another winter in Hawaii, lured to the  islands by the fact of his daughter Karen Pryor's residence there  and the opportunity to visit with his three grandchildren.  As it turned out, Phil had already made his final visit to Hawaii  because death met him in Miami. In what proved to be the last  days of his life, Phil lay back on pillows in a window seat looking  out over an oak tree and commented on the profuseness of the  yellow elder, one of his favorite Florida flowers. Any day a humming bird called on him was a day to celebrate.  Editor's Note: Helen Muir, a close friend of Philip Wylie's and a longtime resident of Miami, is the author of Miami, U.S.A.

Philip Wylie Memorial Address					Wylie, Max, 1904-																											asu0660000024	Philip Wylie Memorial Address  By Max Wylie  Good afternoon. All of you knew Phil and because you did,  then you surely knew that when his own time was to come, there  should be no sadness or farewell in any gathering of his friends  and relatives. During the good years that Phil had—and it was  a very generous allotment—there wasn't any thought of death in  his mind. No conscious preparation to meet it, no fear of it. He  was concerned about death philosophically, to be sure, but only  as a phenomenon every man experiences. And sensitively concerned, in later years, as death took many of his friends, one by  one. Of himself he never bothered to look over his own shoulder.  But to some of us near him, in recent months, were many of the  warning signs that his legacy of time was running out.  Only five months ago Phil and I played golf in nearby Frank-  linville here. He hit some pretty good balls and we had a lovely  afternoon. But I knew then that this was to be our last game.  I think I said goodbye to Phil at that time. Many of you had done  the same, knowing his condition of the past few months.  His accomplishments have now been celebrated in many parts  of the world and I shan't go over the list again. But I'd like to  speak, in these few moments, of gifts that Phil had that did not  relate to his skills as a writer; to speak of his gifts of character.  Though as a writer he was often quick to sting or punish, as  a person he was unendingly compassionate. Children, for example, sensed this at once and in their presence there was no such  thing as a generation gap, even before the phrase came into the  language. It was ideas, never people, who were his adversaries.  He had no personal enemies. And the few men he despised were  in a real sense not men at all but symbols . . . symbols of the  poisoning of humane thought . . . the world's dictators, for example. Phil was a lively hater of injustice anywhere he saw it,  a true champion of the right of any man to doubt, a champion  of the right of any man to disagree and of his right to say so.  Most people who don't write think that successful writers are  peculiar people — and some are — but they think of them also  21   • 	asu06600000240023001							66326808 Bytes	3872	5708	758174032	RGB	8	600	asu06600000240023001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1210	1210	1211.jp2	/asu0660/image/1211.jp2
Philip Wylie Memorial Address					Wylie, Max, 1904-																											asu0660000024	as people who have no problems. This is quite untrue. Many  years ago, for example, in the 30's, I was with Phil when the  morning mail came in. It contained rejections of five manuscripts.  He turned to me, a little sadly as I thought, and he said this: "I  have now had 56 rejections in a row ... 56 and not one damn  sale." Disappointment, or frustration that goes on too long, this  is the hard rock on which so many others most often break their  pick. They can't take the reverses and they break up. But not  Phil. That morning he went back into the kitchen, had a little  more coffee and went quietly to work again.  To me, next to his quality of active compassion, was his  ability, through the years, to stay in any contest until he won it.  He was undefeatable. He had a quick phrase for that. Here it is:  "You're never licked 'til you say so." He had other gifts, one of  them a paradox. Though a retiring person, even a reclusive one,  he was completely accessible to any person, even to any child,  with any problem at any time. He was no more stingy with his  time than he was with his energy, his thought, or his money.  You know he was a great talker. He was also an acutely attentive listener. He devoured information and sought and enjoyed  the companionship of any man who knew more than he did on  any subject. He was not only a mental protagonist, Phil was good  with his hands. He built pools and dams, stone walls, gardens,  cabins. He grew 200 different varieties of orchids. He respected  the skills of the world's artisans, whether stonemason, roofer, or  blacksmith. He was a good man in a boat or a canoe. He was a  swimmer of enormous endurance. He loved every aspect of Nature; and his excoriations of the abusers of Nature, prophetic in  their time, have now been taken up in these later years by a  horde of ecologists, environmentalists and pollution-killers. Phil  was in there first though, having seen it first, warning and scolding and kicking editorial shins.  Though himself not a scientist, his self-education in all the  principal sciences was so extraordinary, he was always being tapped by professional scientists to write pieces that would make  an involved or esoteric aspect of science understandable to the  public. They couldn't do it; he could and he did. He always  • 22 	asu06600000240024001							66442096 Bytes	3876	5712	4187972899	RGB	8	600	asu06600000240024001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1211	1211	1212.jp2	/asu0660/image/1212.jp2

He could be savage, but his ferocity was never meanly used.  It was always to anger people so thoroughly that they had to  do some thinking of their own, many of them for the first time.  He mastered the theories of Carl Jung and supported these in  many articles and in many sections of his non-fiction books.  Perhaps Phil's most exhilarating moment came in a letter from  the famous psychologist-psychiatrist written in German, a language of which Phil had a good understanding. Here is the opening sentence of that letter: "Dear Mr. Wylie — No man in America has ever presented my theories as you are now doing, with  such honesty, such accuracy, or such force."  Phil knew he was living through a most remarkable time;  through the shattering years of his birth in 1902 to the present;  and with his intense curiosities nobody could have been more  pleased to inhabit these years than Phil. Though objecting to  much, he could have no complaints about either its technological  excitements nor the quality of tumult through which this world,  during his own years, was passing. It both fascinated and horrified him, but he never looked away from it. He never flinched  about anything. In this area, to witness and report, he had a tfuly  grand steadiness of purpose: to lay it all on the line; to tell the  whole of it, good and bad.  Though he had the best working habits of any writer I ever  knew, the amount and the quality of his output could not have  occurred had not the conditions of his private life been so productive. During the thirty-three years of marriage to Frederica  Ballard of this town, of this same street, come to think of it,  herself altogether a remarkable person, Ricky was not only the  sustaining influence in his life, she was the central interest. His  dependence and his trust was so firm that had Ricky, for example, pre-deceased Phil, he would have expired in less than a  month. I am absolutely sure of this. Phil was a loving and a  needing man, and she was his answer. It was about the best marriage I ever saw or knew.  He was a fun-lover, too, and a clown, with a great instinct  23 • 	asu06600000240025001							66802336 Bytes	3897	5712	466701499	RGB	8	600	asu06600000240025001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1212	1212	1213.jp2	/asu0660/image/1213.jp2

There could be  no pomposity in any man with such a colorful suffusion of self-  mockery. He cared more, much more, about you than he ever  did about himself. Many years ago he wrote this sentence:  "Man's immortality is in the people who are to come." He survived three desperate illnesses. A ruptured appendix when he  was an 11-year-old, scarlet fever at 15, cholera when he was 44.  But the time to erase Phil had not yet come. Because of the work  he did, the quality of that work, and the integrity of his life, the  time to erase him will never come.

Samuel Beckett: The Sense of Unending					McCarthy, Patrick A., 1945-																											asu0660000035	THE  CARRELL  Volume 23 1985  Samuel Beckett: The Sense of Unending  Ah the old questions, the old answers, there's  nothing like them! —Endgame (1958)  If there may not be no more questions let there  at least be no more answers.       —/// Seen III Said (1981)  by Patrick A. McCarthy  Samuel Beckett is the most paradoxical of modern writers: the desire to end, to stop writing, to lapse into silence is implicit in virtually  all of his works, yet he continues to write. Some progress toward  silence may be discerned in the fact that his fiction and drama since  the mid-1950s have been noticeably leaner than the earlier works, but  there is no consistent pattern of diminution or expansion in the works  of the 1970s and 1980s. Beckett's recent productions continue to confront a limited number of related themes: the Cartesian split between  body and mind; the concept of life as a closed system with finite  possibilities; the inevitability of ennui ("Might not the beatific vision  become a source of boredom, in the long run?" asks Jacques Moran  in Molloy^); various kinds of impotence and immobility; the uncertainty of all knowledge; the confrontation with the void. Like their  author, Beckett's characters are forced into intense awareness of life's  grotesqueness and absurdity, yet go on living; they realize the useless-  ness of language yet continue talking. Language fills the void, postpones the confrontation with silence, so that after an uncomfortably  long pause in Waiting for Godot Vladimir pleads with Estragon to  "Say anything at all!" Alternately, talk may simply be a louder version of silence, "for ever the same murmur, flowing unbroken, like a  single endless word and therefore meaningless" (Texts for Nothing  #8). In the worst case—as in the recent /// Seen III Said and Worst ward  Ho—it is silence itself, an end of talk and of awareness, that is  desirable but unattainable. The unnamed narrator of The Unnamable  recognizes that "In other words, they like other words, no doubt  about it, silence once broken will never again be whole. Is there then  1 	asu06600000350003001							67955268 Bytes	3915	5784	2256798394	RGB	8	600	asu06600000350003001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1219	1219	1220.jp2	/asu0660/image/1220.jp2
Samuel Beckett: The Sense of Unending					McCarthy, Patrick A., 1945-																											asu0660000035	no hope? Good gracious, no, heavens, what an idea!" We do not  know who "they" are—as in "they like other words"—but we know  that the Unnamable is trapped by the "other words," the compulsive  expression, that "they" like. We also know that the Unnamable and  his dilemma are somehow related to us, his hypocrites lecteurs for  whom silence will be no more comforting than language: "I don't  know, I'll never know, in the silence you don't know, you must go on,  I can't go on, I'll go on."  Frank Kermode, in The Sense of an Ending, has connected the certainty of our own deaths to our construction of apocalyptic models of  history and our need for fictions with clear beginnings and endings:  Men, like poets, rush 'into the middest,' in medias res,  when they are born; they also die in mediis rebus, and to  make sense of their span they need fictive concords with  origins and ends, such as give meaning to lives and poems.  The End they imagine will reflect lives and poems. The  End they imagine will reflect their irreducibly intermediary  preoccupations. They fear it, and as far as we can see have  always done so; the End is a figure for their own deaths.2  The linear imagination,  as in Dante and Milton,  moves toward  apocalypse; the cyclic imagination, as in Joyce, leads to repetition and  renewal; the asymptotic imagination, as in Beckett, comes ever closer  to an unseen, unknowable, impossible End. Part of the unease generated by Beckett's works derives from their refusal to reach that End,  to achieve closure or resolution in any conventional sense. Take, for  example, the famous conclusion of Waiting for Godot, identical with  the end of the first act except that the characters have exchanged lines:  VLADIMIR: Well? Shall we go?  ESTRAGON: Yes, let's go.  They do not move.  A comparison of that final stage direction with the typical Exeunt of a  Shakespearean play tells us a great deal about Beckett's drama, in  which entropy, rather than the restoration of potential energy (hierarchical order), rules the conclusion. The same pattern may be found  throughout Beckett's dramas: in Endgame, which concludes with the  blind Hamm talking to himself, unaware that Clov is still on stage (although apparently about to exit); in Krapp's Last Tape, in which  Krapp sits motionless before a tape that continues to turn but has run  out of words; certainly in the monologue Not I, whose final stage direction reads, "Curtain fully down. House dark. Voice continues behind curtain, unintelligible, 10 seconds, ceases as house lights up/9  Beckett would agree with Shakespeare that the world is a stage on  which characters make their entrances; he would not agree that they 	asu06600000350004001							67707344 Bytes	3919	5757	21401658	RGB	8	600	asu06600000350004001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1220	1220	1221.jp2	/asu0660/image/1221.jp2
Samuel Beckett: The Sense of Unending					McCarthy, Patrick A., 1945-																											asu0660000035	necessarily make their exits.  The failure of resolution in Beckett's plays is paralleled in the fiction, which often seems to peter out rather than concluding. Thus  Watt, with its pages of Addenda (including the intriguing notes  "change all the names" and "no symbols where none intended"), introduced by an explanatory footnote: "The following precious and illuminating material should be carefully studied. Only fatigue and disgust prevented its incorporation." Thus Molloy, whose second half  begins, "It is midnight. The rain is beating on the windows," and  ends, "Then I went back into the house and wrote, It is midnight. The  rain is beating on the windows. It was not midnight. It was not raining." Thus, most starkly, Malone Dies, in which Malone simply gives  up his narration in exhaustion:  Lemuel is in charge, he raises his hatchet on which the  blood will never dry, but not to hit anyone, he will not hit  anyone, he will not hit anyone any more, he will not touch  anyone any more, either with it or with it or with it or with  or  or with it or with his hammer or with his stick or with  his fist or in thought in dream I mean never he will never  or with his pencil or with his stick or  or light light I mean  never there he will never  never anything  there  any more  The lack of terminal punctuation is no error.  If endings are associated with revelations, conventional conclusions are associated with unambiguous visions of reality. Beckett's  distaste for the simple structure and simplistic vision of the nineteenth  century novel is evident from his 1931 monograph on Proust, in which  he praises A la Recherche du temps perdu for its impressionistic emphasis on the subject and its avoidance of naive realism, which assumes the existence of a verifiable world of objects. Beckett praises  Proust's refusal "to dissociate form from content"3 and argues that  the reader finds the work emotionally exhausting but never unintelligible: "It is a tiring style, but it does not tire the mind. The clarity of the  phrase is cumulative and explosive. One's fatigue is a fatigue of the  heart, a blood fatigue. One is exhausted and angry after an hour, sub-  3 	asu06600000350005001							67202676 Bytes	3917	5717	3630178534	RGB	8	600	asu06600000350005001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1221	1221	1222.jp2	/asu0660/image/1222.jp2
Samuel Beckett: The Sense of Unending					McCarthy, Patrick A., 1945-																											asu0660000035	merged, dominated by the crest and break of metaphor after metaphor: but never stupefied." The modernist fusion of form and content, as in Proust, places great demands on readers, refusing them the  simple lucidity of conventional language and "closed" structure. In  Beckett, even more clearly, the style reflects the work's fundamental  uncertainty. Moreover, there is a new twist, for while the great modernist writers generally adopted the Romantic conceit that the artist is  a hero, Beckett insists that his own art, being an exploration of weakness and failure, must itself be a failure and can only be the product of  a failure. The neater and more precise Beckett's descriptions of chaos  and indecision become, the further he gets from his real aim: thus, in  /// Seen III Said, he searches constantly for "the wrong word," the  postmodern equivalent of Flaubert's mot juste. When we say that  words fail us, most of us are talking about a temporary condition;  when Beckett says the same thing, he is recognizing both the inadequacy of language to express anything outside its own logic and the  impossibility of escaping language. There is, in fact, a world of difference between Prufrock's lament, "It is impossible to say just what I  mean!" and the matter-of-fact statement of the speaker in First Love  that "I have enough trouble as it is in trying to say what I think I  know."4  In 1949, in a remarkable set of dialogues with Georges Duthuit,  Beckett explained his concept of art as failure. Rejecting the "puny  exploits" of traditional art, which he defines as "a thrusting towards a  more adequate expression of natural experience, as revealed to the  vigilant coenaesthesia," Beckett professes instead to value "The expression that there is nothing to express, nothing with which to express, nothing from which to express, no power to express, no desire  to express, together with the obligation to express." The sort of art envisioned by Beckett is actually an anti-art; his own works are a form of  anti-literature, all the rest, in Verlaine's memorable phrase, being  merely literature.5 Beckett praises the painter Bram van Velde as a true  revolutionary whose paintings show that "there is nothing to paint  and nothing to paint with." Thus, according to Beckett, van Velde admits "that to be an artist is to fail, as no other dare fail, that failure is  his world and the shrink from it desertion, art and craft, good housekeeping, living." All of this has a striking relationship to Beckett's  works, in which absurd quests often seem to represent the writer's  search for new ways to fail. Thus Molloy, a confessional writer who  sometimes forgets his story and sometimes is amazed that he  remembers anything at all ("Well, well, I didn't think I knew this  story so well," he remarks), elaborates on his principles of composition: 	asu06600000350006001							67888084 Bytes	3924	5765	1582620517	RGB	8	600	asu06600000350006001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1222	1222	1223.jp2	/asu0660/image/1223.jp2
Samuel Beckett: The Sense of Unending					McCarthy, Patrick A., 1945-																											asu0660000035	For to contrive a being, a place, I nearly said an hour, but I  would not hurt anyone's feelings, and then to use them no  more, that would be, how shall I say, I don't know. Not to  want to say, not to know what you want to say, not to be  able to say what you think you want to say, and never to  stop saying, or hardly ever, that is the thing to keep in  mind, even in the heat of composition.  In the dialogues with Duthuit, Beckett is somewhat misleading  when he says that the artist has "nothing to express." What he means,  I think, is that the artist has nothing that can be expressed with precision and assurance, our knowledge being uncertain and our language  a troublesome and imperfect instrument of expression. He implies as  much in Watt, where Arsene declares that "what we know partakes in  no small measure of the nature of what has so happily been called the  unutterable or ineffable, so that any attempt to utter or eff it is  doomed to fail, doomed, doomed to fail." The failure to utter the unutterable, to name the unnamable, is the necessary failure of an art  dedicated to total honesty of expression, even at the expense of clarity  of syntax. As Claude Mauriac has noted, the essentially rational nature of language means that "Whoever speaks is carried along by the  logic of language and its articulations," so that "the writer faced with  the inexpressible must find some trick so as not to say what the words  make him say in spite of himself, but rather to convey what words are  designed to suppress: the uncertain, the contradictory, the unthinkable."6 And, as the artist fails because his medium rationalizes the irrational, the critic inevitably repeats the sin to some degree, turning  the work into something other than itself. Far better, from Beckett's  point of view, to accept the work of art on its own terms, much as  Moran, in Molloy, accepts the unknowable nature of the dance of his  bees: "in spite of all the pains I had lavished on these problems, I was  more than ever stupefied by the complexity of this innumerable dance,  involving doubtless other determinants of which I had not the slightest  idea. And I said, with rapture, Here is something I can study all my  life, and never understand." The openness of Beckett's works, including the refusal to provide them with "endings" and clearly defined  levels of meaning, is an essential aspect of their resistance to rational  analysis, to the sort of reductive interpretation that Susan Sontag  defines as "the revenge of the intellect upon art."7  Ending the unendable and expressing the inexpressible are two  necessary activities that relegate the artist's best efforts to failure, at  least when judged by Beckett's stringent and uncompromising standards. Naming the unnamable—a work of literary art, for instance—is another area in which Beckett fails brilliantly.

Samuel Beckett: The Sense of Unending					McCarthy, Patrick A., 1945-																											asu0660000035	his works are one sign of the stages through which the works have  gone. The first stage, from the early 1930s, is the period of irreverent  sophomoric wit, illustrated by such titles as Whoroscope, More Pricks  Than Kicks, and Echo's Bones and Other Precipitates; the same  tendency appears in the titles of two yet-unpublished works, Dream of  Fair to Middling Women (a novel) and Le Kid (a play that travesties  Corneille's Le Cid). The early narrative style, filled with allusions and  rather obviously anti-conventional, concludes with Murphy, whose title points to the second phase, a period of name titles: Watt, Mercier  and Camier, Molloy, Malone Dies. This series of works focusing on a  single person or pair of persons, seen either from the outside (Watt,  Mercier and Camier) or inside (Molloy, Malone Dies), culminates in  The Unnamable, in which the attempt to name, and thereby end the  play of meanings, has been abandoned, and in Waiting for Godot, in  which the very existence of the character named in the title is in doubt.  Since Godot, Beckett has narrowed his canvas, as we might gather  from such generic titles as Stories and Texts for Nothing, Play, Film,  Act Without Words, and A Piece of Monologue, and such thematic  titles as Endgame, How It Is, Enough, Come and Go, Breath,  Lessness, Company, and Catastrophe. Several titles, like Catastrophe,  suggest the theme of failure. The title of a 1976 volume of eight short  prose pieces, Fizzles, was explained by Beckett, who said that the  pieces had been "farted out"; Beckett helpfully added that the book's  title incorporated two meanings of "fizzle" sanctioned by the OED,  "breaking wind quietly" and "A failure or a fiasco."8 Other titles in  this self-deprecating vein include three recent volumes, the prose fictions /// Seen III Said (1981) and Worstward Ho (1983) and the volume  of miscellaneous work, Disjecta (1984).  The recent fictions indicate that Beckett is still striving to produce  what he called, in his 1938 essay on Denis Devlin, an art of "pure interrogation, rhetorical question less the rhetoric." Ill Seen III Said,  which at times adopts the style of a film scenario ("Close-up of a dial.  Nothing else. White disc divided into minutes. Unless it be seconds"  [p. 45]), focuses on an old woman living, and dying, in a cabin "At the  inexistent centre of a formless place" (p. 8). Situated somewhere near  a pasture, surrounded by a "zone of stones," she is the unknowable,  unnamable, almost unthinkable other with which the artist must contend. The narrator is imperfect, uncertain, his vision defective (ill  seen) rather than omniscient (all seen). Hence he raises questions that  he cannot answer:  How come a cabin in such a place? How came? Careful.  Before replying that in the far past at the time of its  building there was clover growing to its very walls.

And from it as from an  evil core that the what is the wrong word the evil spread.  And none to urge—none to have urged its demolition, (pp.  8-9)  Unable to imagine finding the right word, the narrator searches for  "the wrong word," a phrase repeated several times. As for the old  woman, she is perhaps entirely real (whatever that means in the  Beckettian world), perhaps entirely imaginary, perhaps the product of  a conspiracy between mind and external world. There is of course no  way to settle the issue with any assurance, and therefore no legitimate  way to end the quest. The narrator, or voice, or quester would prefer  that the woman be imaginary and therefore in some sense under his  control: "If only she could be pure figment. Unalloyed. This old so  dying woman. So dead. In the madhouse of the skull and nowhere  else" (p. 20); "Not possible any longer except as figment. Not endurable" (p. 30). Yet the distinction between inner and outer has become  so blurred that it is impossible to say where, or how, the woman exists:  Such the confusion now between real and—how say its  contrary? No matter. That old tandem. Such now the confusion between them once so twain. And such the farrago  from eye to mind. For it to make what sad sense of it may.  No matter now. Such equal liars both. Real and—how ill  say its contrary? The counter-poison, (p. 40)  The word the narrator cannot summon up is presumably "ideal," although the answer that he unwittingly gives—"No matter"—would  do well enough as an antonym or "counter-poison" for the "real."  We have in this passage a concise demonstration of both halves of the  book's title: 77/ Seen—the problem of transforming imperfect perception into empirical knowledge—is "the farrago from eye to mind"; ///  Said— the impossibility of precise articulation—is suggested in "how  say its contrary?" and reinforced by the desperate "how ill say its contrary?" Like much of Beckett's writing, this passage demonstrates the  fine balance between agony and comedy, a balance succinctly expressed by Nell's casual observation, in Endgame, that "Nothing is  funnier than unhappiness."  The source of agony, here as in the trilogy and Endgame, is the  frustrated desire to end: as Waiting for Godot focuses on the tedium  of existence and Film the fear of being perceived, /// Seen III Said deals  with the perceiver's wish to escape his wretched perception and his still  more wretched expression of that perception. In a world in which light  is "treacherous" and haze the "sole certitude" (p. 48), the only goal  consciously understood is the dark, solitude, silence. Nonetheless  there is the repeated command, "On," either the demand of a mys-  8 	asu06600000350010001							67272512 Bytes	3919	5720	1625038144	RGB	8	600	asu06600000350010001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1226	1226	1227.jp2	/asu0660/image/1227.jp2

The  command is effective, more so each time it is repeated:  From where she lies she sees Venus rise. On. From  where she lies when the skies are clear she sees Venus rise  followed by the sun. Then she rails at the source of all life.  On. At evening when the skies are clear she savours its  star's revenge. At the other window. Rigid upright on her  old chair she watches for the radiant one. Her old deal  spindlebacked kitchen chair. It emerges from out the last  rays and sinking ever brighter is engulfed in its turn. On.  (P. 7)  Thus we begin: one "on" preceded by one sentence and followed by  two (the first of which elaborates on the opening sentence); a second  "on" followed by five sentences or fragments; and a third "on." The  fourth "on" will appear a page later, the fifth two pages after that,  the sixth ten pages hence (pp. 8, 10, 20). The gap widens once more,  with 38 pages intervening between the sixth occurrence and the  seventh: "So on" (p. 58). We have taken a while to overcome inertia,  but once we have built up some momentum we need the goading "on"  less frequently. Unexpectedly, just over a page after the seventh prodding, the book ends: "One moment more. One last. Grace to breathe  that void. Know happiness" (p. 59). The book comes to a halt here,  just as The Unnamable concludes with the narrator's last "I'll go on";  but a reader who has watched the pattern of "on" commands in 77/  Seen III Said may be forgiven for regarding this termination as nothing  more than an arbitrary stopping point, devoid of even the whiff of  apocalyptic significance.  What is happening through this mysterious and beautiful work  cannot be stated with any assurance, but there are some patterns  worth noting. An old woman looks at Venus, the evening star, named  after the most beautiful of the goddesses; we look at the old woman.  At first the two actions seem unrelated, but in time it appears that,  since the curtains must be drawn aside for the woman to see out of her  cabin or for us to see in, the two acts are linked, one mirroring the  other. Moreover, the possibility that the woman lives in "the madhouse of the skull and nowhere else" (p. 20) suggests that her cabin,  like the set of Endgame, might be regarded as the inside of a skull.  Hers or the narrator's? That, too, is unclear, although the narrator's  relief at finding "the curtains gone without loss of dark" (p. 56) suggests that it is his skull, the curtains his eyelids. In any event, tearing  aside the curtains does not lead to any revelation, even though it occurs at "the place of the skull. One April afternoon" (p. 57).

Samuel Beckett: The Sense of Unending					McCarthy, Patrick A., 1945-																											asu0660000035	would be the crucifixion at Golgotha, "the place of a skull,"10 an  event that signifies not only the end but—especially for a writer who  claims Good Friday as his birthday"11—the beginning as well.  That birth is a kind of death is a typical Beckettian motif: "Birth  was the death of him," says the speaker of A Piece of Monologue,  particularizing the observation of Pozzo, in Waiting for Godot, that  "They give birth astride of a grave, the light gleams an instant, then  it's night once more." That brief gleam of light, even more disturbing  than when Matthew Arnold saw it on the French coast across from  Dover Beach, signifies both the ephemerality of life and the uncertainty of our knowledge and perception. In /// Seen III Said, however, the  dying of the light is a subject not for rage but for joy, its only drawback the possibility that it might not last: "Seeing the black night or  better blackness pure and simple that limpid they would shed. Blackness in its might at last. Where no more to be seen. Perforce to be  seen" (p. 58). Perception, like expression, seems inescapable, and the  final confrontation with the void no more truly final than the second  act of Waiting for Godot.  Godot, although conventional in form compared with Beckett's  recent productions, is close to them in spirit: it, too, deals with ways  "To vary the monotony," as Beckett puts it in /// Seen III Said (pp.  41-42). The command "On," heard so often in /// Seen III Said, originates in Pozzo's repeated command to his slave Lucky: "On" is the  first word that Pozzo speaks in Godot, and it is the last as well. The  command reappears in Worstward Ho, both at the beginning—"On.  Say on. Be said on. Somehow on. Till nohow on. Said nohow on" (p.  7)—and at the end: "Said nohow on" (p. 47). In this latest of  Beckett's prose works, articulate expression is more difficult than  ever, and more painful: hence the virtual absence of syntactically complete declarative sentences. It is also more inherently flawed: having  sought "the wrong word" in III Seen III Said, Beckett now is driving  "worstward," that is, toward the worst word, the most elementary  and unliterary level of expression. And even in this endeavor he will  fail: "All of old. Nothing else ever. Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter.  Try again. Fail again. Fail better" (p. 7).  Worstward Ho is like a version of "Childe Roland to the Dark  Tower Came" shorn of Browning's comforting illusion that salvation  lies in enduring to the end. Like Roland, Beckett's narrator wanders  through an existential landscape in search of an appropriate failure.  The title suggests that he is also searching for death, which comes "in  the west as a rule," according to How It Is; but the fact that the narrator's first and last words, like Pozzo's, are "On" suggests that his  quest is unending and perhaps circular.

Samuel Beckett: The Sense of Unending					McCarthy, Patrick A., 1945-																											asu0660000035	tion—"skull and stare" (p. 34)—are inescapable; so the narrator continually recombines the elements of existence, seen in the "Dim light  source unknown" (p. 9) that bathes the world of this book.  Worstward Ho resembles no other text so much as The Unnamable, another book that ends with the word "on." The Unnamable  cannot be named because he is God, or at least a godlike artist brooding over his creation. In Worstward Ho, again, we have the artist-god,  this time at an earlier, more primordial, stage. He creates out of  nothing a being—"Say a body. Where none" (p. 7)—which, being  brought into existence, has "No choice but stand. Somehow up and  stand. Somehow stand. That or groan" (p. 10). He creates another  (pp. 10-11), and soon they are seen "In the dim void bit by bit [as] an  old man and child. Any other would do as ill" (p. 13). The world of  this creation is already imperfect, painful, fallen: hence "Hand in  hand with equal plod they go" (p. 13), vaguely echoing Milton's  description of the expulsion from Eden.12 Created by language, this  company—child, old man, and eventually an old woman as  well—cannot so easily be uncreated: "Say child gone. As good as  gone. From the void. From the stare. Void then not that much more?  Say old man gone. Old woman gone. As good as gone. Void then not  that much more again? No. Void most when almost" (p. 43). In this  final state even the void is little comfort: "Enough. A pox on void.  Unmoreable unlessable unworseable evermost almost void" (p. 43).  Yet the narrator, as always, goes "on."  Despite—perhaps because of—the existential pain that they exude,  /// Seen III Said and Worstward Ho are strangely beautiful. Beckett's  mastery of prose style, and his continual confrontation with the fundamental problems of human thought and life, are particularly evident here. His literary productions will undoubtedly continue until he  dies; indeed, they will certainly continue to appear after his death,  given the existence of various unpublished manuscripts. Having impossibly high standards for himself, Beckett is perpetually dissatisfied  with his work: the monologuist in Enough surely speaks for his  creator when he declares, "Given three or four lives I might have accomplished something." Given only one life, Samuel Beckett  seems—contrary to his own opinion—to have accomplished something, and in the process to have given us a paradoxical model of  heroic endurance in the search for failure.

He dreams:  And so  The sea and the leaves  And the wind,  riloodred and dark  In his seeming,  Perceive  The hum of themselves  In his ear,  The coming and going  Of being,  The skirling and crimping  And whirling  Of windswept water on coral  Around the man  Dreaming the sea in himself  In the seagrape thicket.  15  j  f 	asu06600000350016001							67940404 Bytes	3910	5790	3941697625	RGB	8	600	asu06600000350016001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1232	1232	1233.jp2	/asu0660/image/1233.jp2

A fish like a violet eye  stares from the calcium lid  of a shell, one of many  white strewn halves,  familiar perimeters  of their alien makers.  The fish esses  up the tapering tail  of a conch and through  the harp of bubbles  urgently obeying  an inverted gravity—  the violent melody  of a spectral extreme.  It is nothing  but the role I assign to it,  an extreme myself amid  the grunting maneuvers  of bar chatter. I am quiet  and let my thoughts swirl  through genies of cigar smoke  uncorked from my mouth.  A wish, master, a wish:  to be fish-like  in a fluid world.  16 	asu06600000350017001							66938020 Bytes	3901	5718	3279065758	RGB	8	600	asu06600000350017001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1233	1233	1234.jp2	/asu0660/image/1234.jp2

He doesn't scare  when his reflection  fictions on the glass  as do the others.  He scares, rather, at their scaring,  and enters a nostalgia  he has gardened since birth.  A trite angling of the body  over a bar, brandy glass  and cigar are the only passports  to unreconciled coexistence  with vulgar passings.

No matter how I revise them  my bovine hips never fit  the turnstile. Old hat in pincurls,  I guide a stuttering cart  picked from dozens of good ones,  knock down every aisle,  cackle about it, explain myself  to mute passers-by.  Among them the right people wince:  from the shelves I take the easy can,  things labeled Sweet Life, Shurfine.  I am a sweaty cliche, drop my humble pie  crust-side down,  commit myself to the check-out stand,  hands full of cabbage  as good as the brain  that drives me home to chastise.  There I unpack my sacks  full of moot, mutter  over lists forgotten, the consensus  I could have had.

Imagine the Ingenue					Vinlove, Kathleen																											asu0660000035	Imagine the Ingenue  Her face is wistful. Froth  of dawn stirs itself between her satin  sheets. No need for make-believe.  These days flip into place,  exponential 10 x 8's  where she is a constant, her arms a flag  on antique cars, her number pressed  into dealers' palms, voices that promise  thousands of diamonds  will drip off the stars. Every sun  swabs dew from her lawn,  seeps into half-shut eyes,  nudges her back  when well-padded boys tallied  the ballots, and she  knelt in the wet green  fancying up a convertible  with tissue buds, her first name.  Parades, night. The gown she wore  parachuted down the stadium stairs,  guided her to a center  that spent its fireworks,  spread out its screams and drums.  Daddy came. Her white-gloved hand  wagged up to him, wiped unsoiled air  full of cheers that could not leap across  to daylight, to the solid house  and the yard's debris of leaves,  torn paper. One by one she picked off  her stapled blooms, swept them  into a heap as she imagined  the real queen arranged  her new red dozen.  All this flashes in corners,  clicks from yesterday's manicure,  descends upon her like lint  on the myriad pairs of shoes  she will never wear.  19 	asu06600000350020001							67470136 Bytes	3904	5759	3894521821	RGB	8	600	asu06600000350020001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1236	1236	1237.jp2	/asu0660/image/1237.jp2

I have the cupped hands  of Mary. I carry you home  in a paper shroud, afraid  of sudden shudders, false death,  resurrection. Are you male  or female? Are there ways to tell?  With your wing on a stone  I sketch various hues, a span  that snaps back without wind.  It is your eyes I avoid,  their wide sight turned narrow  by one invisible causeway.  They were sincere architects  who built your parousia  out of glass, the hard smack  you mistook for heaven.  I bury you  after twenty-four hours,  listen to the trill  of what had been your song:  sweet sweet  Canada canada Canada.

I watch them as though  any moment they might balk  at the yard, or streak to a late  south, their wings butane  striking against sky. I watch them  as heat returns to this kitchen  in gentle bombs. Lazy plowhand,  the sun drags condensation  down a leaky pane. Every surface  germinates: molecules rotate  unfelt under my fingertips,  two tomatoes on the window ledge  split their miniscule pigment.  The woman cautioned me  they would never turn,  those greenhouse grown.  Now they flare, bawdy ripe  against my yard's unfilled white  despite the furious calm  with which I shake this day  over a rail, loosening the stakes  one traps by stealthy waiting  as the woman shakes from her broom  snow onto snow, all green gone under.  22 	asu06600000350023001							67149796 Bytes	3907	5727	4015670565	RGB	8	600	asu06600000350023001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1239	1239	1240.jp2	/asu0660/image/1240.jp2
Upon a Cow's Lips					Vinlove, Kathleen																											asu0660000035	Upon a Cow's Lips  The day they hoisted him atop  Kansas City's Hereford Building  his status remained unchanged.  He was dreaming of udders  while men in tweed jackets and Stetsons  bickered over his ass, its direction.  Heifers in hot weather,  he thought. No class.  Later he could recant  that lackadaisical moment,  his twin stomachs strobing in sync  with the sun. He had all  of a 90-foot-pylon scope,  still the river below him was nothing  to shoot for, or so remarked  the crony bluejay, pestering his neck.  Only Miss Charolais, queen of the rodeo,  came to curtsy beneath him,  her milky skin pinkening,  her stiff gingham skirt  an overturned basket of fruit.  The crown she wore preened  its sequins, twinkling like flies  on his dessert.  Nights, when the city emptied  its furniture and he had memorized  the billboard and its Marlboro Man,  he wanted to blurt out in baritone  veni vidi vici,  straining the v's to vibrate  through that hustler's ten-gallon dome.  The painted horizon made him conjure  whole herds, ripe cows  whose rock-a-bye lips held expanses  in an ultimate afternoon pause.  It was then in his insomniac eyes  hundreds of tails did their two-step.  Banjos twanged. The skyline turned runway,  and as the freeways parted,  the steer in him leaped clear  to Cloud County, Kansas,  the choice side of the moon. 	asu06600000350024001							68299676 Bytes	3952	5759	3530247839	RGB	8	600	asu06600000350024001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1240	1240	1241.jp2	/asu0660/image/1241.jp2
Notes to Samuel Beckett					McCarthy, Patrick A., 1945-																											asu0660000035	Notes to Samuel Beckett  1. All quotations are from the American (Grove Press) editions of Beckett's  works. Page numbers will be cited parenthetically for /// Seen III Said and Worstward  Ho.  2. Frank Kermode, The Sense of an Ending: Studies in the Theory of Fiction (New  York: Oxford University Press, 1967), p. 7.  3. In 1929 Beckett praised Joyce's Work in Progress (which later became Fin-  negans Wake) in similar terms: "Here form is content, content is form. You complain  that this stuff is not written in English. It is not written at all. It is not to be read—or  rather it is not only to be read. It is to be looked at and listened to. [Joyce's] writing is  not about something: it is that something itself " {Disjecta: Miscellaneous Writings and  a Dramatic Fragment, p. 27.)  4. Cf. Mercier and Camier, p. 83: "I can think of no word, said Mercier, nor of  any set of words, to express what we imagine we are trying to do."  5. "Et tout le reste est litterature" (Paul Verlaine, "Art poetique"). Verlaine's  protest against dishonesty and artificiality is repeated by Henry Miller in Tropic of  Cancer, where the narrator says, "Everything that was literature has fallen from me.  There are no more books to be written, thank God." Likewise, near the end of Molloy,  Moran says, "I am sorry I cannot indicate more clearly how this result was obtained, it  would have been something worth reading. But it is not at this late stage of my relation  that I intend to give way to literature."  6. Claude Mauriac, The New Literature, trans. Samuel I. Stone (New York:  George Braziller, 1959), p. 81.  7. Susan Sontag, "Against Interpretation" (1964), reprinted in Against Interpretation and Other Essays (New York: Dell, 1981), p. 7.  8. Deirdre Bair, Samuel Beckett: A Biography (New York: Harcourt Brace  Jovanovich, 1978), p. 639.  9. Molloy says, "What I'd like now is to speak of the things that are left, say my  goodbyes, finish dying. They don't want that." Malone speculates: "Perhaps they  think I am dead. Or perhaps they are dead themselves. I say they, though perhaps I  should not." The Unnamable returns obsessively to "them" at the end of his monologue: "they're going to stop, I know that well, I can feel it, they're going to abandon  me . . . you must say words, as long as there are any, until they find me, until they say  me . . . perhaps they have said me already, perhaps they have carried me to the threshold of my story, before the door that opens on my story, that would surprise me. ..."  {Three Novels, pp. 7, 253, 414.) In The Unnamable, "they" are at least intermittently  the words that keep the narrator in existence.  10. Cf. Matthew 27:33, Mark 15:22, John 19:17. The Latin "Calvary" has the same  sense as the Hebrew "Golgotha."  11. Beckett mentions his Good Friday birth three times in Company (1980): pp.  15-16, 34, 35.  12. "They hand in hand with wand'ring steps and slow,/Through Eden took thir  solitary way." Paradise Lost, XII. 648-49.  Dr. Patrick A.

Theodore Spicer-Simson, 1871-1959					Rosner, George W.																											asu0660000023	THE  CARRELL  Volume 12 December 1971 Number 2  Theodore Spicer-Simson  1871-1959  This issue of The Carrell is a continuation of the tribute to Theodore  Spicer-Simson begun in the preceding issue (v. 12, no. 1, June 1971)  commemorating the 100th anniversary of his birth. Theodore Spicer-  Simson was a sculptor-artist of great versatility. An Englishman who  lived and worked in Paris, London and the United States, his chief  interest, as an artist, was human character. For more than fifty years,  distinguished men and women of many countries sat to him for their  portraits in marble and in bronze. He revived the ancient and almost  forgotten art of the portrait medallion, working his subtle character  interpretations in enduring metal.  Recognition of Theodore Spicer-Simson as a medallist,  and international public acclaim of his genius in this  art form, came after many years of painstaking effort.  In Europe his unique ability had won him the award of highest  honor at the International Exhibition at Brussels in 1910 and  again in 1912 at Ghent. At the outbreak of World War I Theodore and his wife Margaret, both in their mid-forties, were  living in Paris. Before bank assets could be frozen by the exigencies of war they withdrew almost all their money. On the very  day the first airplane bombed Paris they fled the city and eleven  hours later took passage for the United States aboard the lie de  France by simply boarding the steamer unchallenged amid the  great dockside confusion.  It was not until 1919 that a joint exhibit of his sculpture  and portrait medallions and the paintings of Henri Caro-Del- 	asu06600000230003001							67400556 Bytes	3916	5735	2962617735	RGB	8	600	asu06600000230003001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1247	1247	1248.jp2	/asu0660/image/1248.jp2
Theodore Spicer-Simson, 1871-1959					Rosner, George W.																											asu0660000023	vaille at the Art Institute of Chicago brought him to the attention  of American connoisseurs. There followed invitations to exhibit  in Detroit, Toledo, Buffalo and New York. As his reputation  expanded demands for his work kept pace. Famous and, even  more significantly, wealthy patrons sought portraiture. Theodore,  always frugal, usually on the brink of poverty, began to prosper.  This was a welcome change from the years prior to the war  when he was often obliged to borrow and to peddle his medallions from museum to museum in France, Germany and Great  Britain. His great compulsion, bordering on snobbery, for meeting people of importance and influence was appeased, too. Theodore actively and unabashedly sought patronage from among  the well-to-do and the prominent. American notables among his  portraitures included Henry Ford, the Gimbel family, Andrew  Carnegie, Gilbert Colgate, several Hammonds, C. S. Mott (President of General Motors), Gertrude Lamont and Mrs. Robertson  Lamont, Mrs. Cyrus McCormick, William Proctor, Caroline  Morgan, Mrs. Charles P. (Anna) Taft, Alexander Graham Bell.  In Cincinnati Theodore also made friends with W. T. H.  Howe, then head of the American Book Company. Howe was  a bibliophile whose fine collection of books and manuscripts  later was acquired by the New York Public Library. He had  bought James Stephens' manuscript of The Crock of Gold and  learning that Theodore had done a portrait medallion of Stephens, Howe purchased a replica for his collection. Theodore had  great admiration for literary people, so it needed but little effort  on the part of Mr. Howe to persuade him to compile a "gallery"  of British and Irish authors. If further encouragement was needed  he received that too from Howe who promised to buy replicas  of each author portrayed and to get his friends to do likewise.  This project led to the most productive and satisfying years of  Theodore's career.  After almost seven years of "exile" in America — years in  which the joy of success was tinged with the anxiety and heartbreak over the destruction of their beloved France the Spicer-  Simsons were eager to return to Europe. Margaret was impatient  to resume her role of housekeeper and hostess. Hotels, apartments, guest rooms were not her life-style. She longed for a 	asu06600000230004001							66342148 Bytes	3856	5733	1622485484	RGB	8	600	asu06600000230004001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1248	1248	1249.jp2	/asu0660/image/1249.jp2

Theodore, on his part, was already consumed with plans for  "capturing" leading British literary figures. While in New York  preparing for departure to England he learned that John Galsworthy was also in the City conferring with publishers. Here,  ready at hand, was a literary great eminently qualified for inclusion in Theodore's proposed gallery. He had met John and  Ada Galsworthy in London before his American sojourn, so  lost no time in making contact.  Theodore relates this meeting in his autobiography, A Collector of Characters (University of Miami Press, 1962) "I remember the lovely day in June when the Galsworthys asked us for  tea. We were shown into a drawing room, the only occupant a  great white, shaggy, beautifully groomed dog. He looked inquiringly at us, then jumped onto the sofa where my wife sat  and licked her cheek. At that moment John came into the room,  saw the dog's action and said, 'You have been accepted.'" And  Theodore, too, was accepted. The Galsworthy portrait medallion  became the first of what later evolved into his gallery of twenty-  nine literary figures. Pleased with his portrait Galsworthy ordered one of his wife. He also arranged to have Thomas Hardy  sit for Theodore.  Once in England, Theodore promptly communicated with  Hardy at his home, Max Gate, Dorchester. He took lodgings  at an hotel within walking range. He records that during a  sitting he said one day, "You know, Mr. Hardy, I am trying to  please myself in this medallion and not particularly you." Hardy  quickly turned his head and replied, "You are quite right, young  man; that is why I write poetry." Mrs. Hardy was especially  pleased with the result, saying she believed it to be the best  portrait of him ever done and that if she had to choose one to  Hve with it would certainly be this one.  But perhaps most gratifying to Theodore was Galsworthy's  persuading Joseph Conrad to sit for a medallion. Conrad had  steadfastly refused Theodore's overtures. It was therefore somewhat of a happy surprise to receive a note asking that he come  to Bishopsbourne, Kent, to do a portrait. Theodore describes 	asu06600000230005001							66639364 Bytes	3878	5726	665628341	RGB	8	600	asu06600000230005001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1249	1249	1250.jp2	/asu0660/image/1250.jp2
Theodore Spicer-Simson, 1871-1959					Rosner, George W.																											asu0660000023	Conrad as a short, thin man, serious and stern. In spite of his  complete mastery of the written language he spoke English with  a guttural accent, so he preferred to speak French.  Their first meeting was spiced with some misunderstandings  and mild irritation on the part of Conrad. However, at the second  sitting, a satisfactory concord was established probably because  Mrs. Conrad and Margaret Spicer-Simson were present. Both  women had great charm and apparently had learned how to  cope with and appease creative males. The occasion included  lunch which was prepared entirely by Mrs. Conrad. Here was  immediate bond between the ladies — a home cooked meal that  included apple pie, a specialty for which Mrs. Conrad was  famous. It must also have appealed to Theodore's sense of economy. He describes Mrs. Conrad in words that would apply as  well to Margaret, "She was an exuberant and kindly person who  loved talking and eating."  Theodore does not record by what rationale he chose his subjects. Judging from many references he makes to literary style  and context he was extremely well-read. He undoubtedly knew  the literary market, too. The most frequent and assured contacts  were made by satisfied clients who, with suitable recommendations, passed him along to friends equally famous. The benefits  were mutual: Theodore's reputation as artist and craftsman was  enhanced by the continuing stream of commissions and those  portrayed welcomed this extra nudge toward immortality by the  enduring medium of a bronze medallion. Publishers, too, must  have welcomed the added publicity for their authors, especially  when major museums sought replicas.  Theodore was his own agent, seeking commissions tirelessly.  Introduction frequently was a finished medallion which he would  use as a calling card (later prudently retrieved) and a means of  entry to those he sought who were unfamiliar with his work.  Solicitation, always a delicate matter, would also be made by  letter, through literary agents, and sometimes in the case of foreign subjects by consular personnel. Determined and not easily  dissuaded, once he had singled out a potential subject he used  a variety of approaches, all with irreproachable dignity and politest etiquette, but nonetheless unrelenting. 	asu06600000230006001							66641360 Bytes	3868	5741	1042539588	RGB	8	600	asu06600000230006001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1250	1250	1251.jp2	/asu0660/image/1251.jp2

It was well-known that Hudson  was shy and shunned publicity. Chances of his sitting for a portrait were slight. So Theodore launched a several-pronged attack:  by letter, via the sympathetic John and Ada Galsworthy who  were Hudson's intimate friends, and through Hudson's publisher.  Which was effective (possibly the combined weight of all three)  is not known, but, despite the encroaching infirmities of his 80th  year, Hudson consented to sit. Their first meeting was for lunch  at William Whiteley's, London's "Universal Provider." It is a  temptation to visualize them descending that wide and massive  marble stairway after what must have been the meagerest of  meals for both men were on rigid health regimen: Margaret,  plump, rosy-cheeked and amiable, flanked on one side by the  tall, spare, well-tailored and craggy-featured Hudson, on the  other by her beloved Theodore, hawk-nosed, angular, aristocratic, his straight-backed six feet four inches dominating Hudson's stooped-shouldered six feet two. Theodore caps the scene  by saying, "We had the usual polite discussion as to who was  to pay for the lunch so Hudson proposed tossing a penny; he  lost." Later, after Theodore gave him a copy of his portrait  medallion, Hudson wrote:  I am delighted to have it, especially as I get it for nothing.  But I can't allow myself a second copy as I am not, like Galsworthy and Wells, a millionaire. I am a person of very modest  means. Much more than sufficient for bread and cheese, I  allow, but in these days, while I linger here, my one luxury  is that for which man was once accounted mad — 'casting  away.' There is, of course, a purpose in such madness; one  cannot expect any return to oneself, but the hope is that some  benefit will result to others . . .  The "casting away" may have been a pun, but it was an actuality,  too. The original of this portrait medallion is in the University  of Miami Library and Hudson's copy is in the National Portrait  Gallery, London.  Arnold Bennett was Theodore's next target. There seems to  have been no difficulty obtaining his consent. Theodore found  him "who is so loquacious in his books . . . rather a silent man 	asu06600000230009001							67131784 Bytes	3889	5752	800141087	RGB	8	600	asu06600000230009001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1253	1253	1254.jp2	/asu0660/image/1254.jp2

Bennett acknowledged the tribute by sending a first  edition of The Old Wives' Tales inscribed "To Theodore Spicer-  Simson, who modelled me with great eclat in two and one-half  sittings."  H. G. Wells, however, proved aloof and unapproachable.  Clearly the situation called for a direct and strong attack. Having  no special introduction, Theodore left a number of his medallic  portraits at Wells's home to arouse his interest. There was a  prompt and brusque phone call from Wells who said he couldn't  sit and would Theodore please call by four that afternoon to  pick up his medallions. At the appointed hour Wells himself  opened the door. Theodore was led to the drawing room and  introduced to four or five of Wells's friends. The next few moments attest to the perspicacity and salesmanship of Theodore,  the opportunist. Wells excused himself to fetch the medallions  and meanwhile Theodore convinced the other guests of his  artistry and they in turn persuaded Wells to sit for a portrait!  There followed portraits of A. E. Housman, then at Trinity  College, Cambridge, John Masefield and poet laureate Robert  Bridges. Most of Theodore's subjects found him personally in  tune with their own philosophies, character, and ideals. With  many he maintained life-long friendships. Not so with Robert  Bridges, however.  After completing twenty-nine portraits Theodore, in conjunction with Stewart P. Sherman who wrote penetrating vignettes  on each author portrayed, published Men of Letters of the British  Isles (New York, William Edwin Rudge, 1924). Sherman, a  scholar renowned for his sensitive perception and directness of  expression wrote:  ... the imagination of Robert Bridges has never left the  classical school, has never broken the Graeco-Roman mould.  When he goes swimming, for example, in an English river, it  quite inevitably occurs to him to request the Hamadryades to  watch his clothes.  Bridges was so offended by Sherman's criticism that he renounced Theodore's friendship. Although pleased enough with  his portrait to ask permission to use it as a frontispiece for his  next volume of poems, he left it out.  •  8 	asu06600000230010001							66569244 Bytes	3878	5720	964990943	RGB	8	600	asu06600000230010001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1254	1254	1255.jp2	/asu0660/image/1255.jp2
Theodore Spicer-Simson, 1871-1959					Rosner, George W.																											asu0660000023	Ralph Hodgson, the next sitter, remained Theodore's close  friend until Theodore's death in 1959. From their very first  meeting each man felt himself in complete accord with the other.  One initial bond was a mutual love of animals. Shortly after  the medallion was cast Theodore had a copy made of which  he says, "As Hodgson was not a wealthy man I gave him his  portrait in bronze ..." — a high tribute and a testimony of  their friendship.  To get in touch with George Bernard Shaw, Theodore solicited  a letter of introduction from Lady Scott, the widow of Robert  Falcon Scott of South Pole fame. Katherine Bruce Scott had  known Theodore in his earlier Paris days and she had done a  statuette of Shaw. Letter in hand and without any further preliminaries Theodore presented himself at 10 Adelphi Terrace.  He was received politely and after seeing some samples Theodore  had brought Shaw said he would sit "with pleasure." The sessions  that followed were apparently amiable. They discussed mutual  friends including Rodin whose bust of Shaw was in the drawing  room. Theodore described his plan for the proposed book on  British men of letters and asked Shaw what he thought of the  idea of having the "sitters" write their own biographies. The  answer was, "You will have to write the book yourself. The  sitter who can write won't because he can't afford to write for  nothing. Those who can't will be willing and even eager, but  they will be unreadable."  Shaw was sufficiently pleased with his portrait to commission  one of Mrs. Shaw. Shortly after it was completed a request for  a replica came from Dublin's national museum. Mrs. Shaw refused to grant permission saying:  I must tell you that I have spent a great part of my life avoiding the making and diffusion of pictures of myself, I am superstitious about it. You may see how true this is by the allusion  to it in Sir John Lavery's life just published. I am so sorry if  this seems churlish and unfriendly. It is a kind of mania with  me. It grows with my growth.  Twenty-five years later the Dublin Museum's order was filled.  Mrs. Shaw died in 1943. Three years later Theodore renewed  the request for permission to reproduce and Shaw wrote explain- 	asu06600000230011001							67123352 Bytes	3913	5716	3731757452	RGB	8	600	asu06600000230011001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1255	1255	1256.jp2	/asu0660/image/1256.jp2
Theodore Spicer-Simson, 1871-1959					Rosner, George W.																											asu0660000023	ing that his wife had been sensitive about her personal appearance and resented the slightest attempt to pass her off as a  conventionally pretty woman, concluding with "There is now  no reason why you should not reproduce the medallion, ad lib."  To Theodore each new face was always a new problem. Instead of being content with achieving a successful likeness he  had a fundamental rule that if the whole design were not good  the medallion was a failure and not a work of art. He had developed what he considered a "psychology" by which he analyzed  each sitter before laying down a single feature. Taken into prime  consideration was the position of the head in the circle. Rarely  did he do a portrait in full-face. Dominant personalities, he felt,  should be done in high relief. Conversely, sensitivity and gentleness, the latter usually applying to women, deserved low relief.  The lettering, too, was determined by certain conditions. For  example, he considered Shaw's works "preponderate^ intellectual, so we see him in his portrait firmly planted in the centre,  straight up and down, while the lettering is like scales creating  a balance on each side and the space around the head is absolutely free." Conrad's portrait shows him gazing intently outside  the circle, nothing obstructing "his far-seeing eyes." His name  is in large letters pressing close to his head like a crown to insure  this "freedom of outlook." George Meredith is in such low relief  that the head almost flows on the surface. It bears no lettering.  Theodore does not explain this interpretation; he merely states  that the Society of Authors asked him to do the portrait.  He was prompted to do a portrait of G. K. Chesterton after  being highly stimulated by his Tremendous Trifles. In a gush  of praise Theodore says of this author, "He combines humour  and seriousness, tying them together by delicate threads of suggestion which are sometimes of as little import as a passing  shower except for the beauty revealed, and at other times clamping joy and sorrow together as if with rings of iron and in such  unexpected yet true ways you wonder you had never done it  yourself."  Rapidly thereafter came Laurence Binyon who, in turn, procured W. H. Davies. There are only passing references to these  gentlemen so it is not possible to establish why Theodore chose  •  10 	asu06600000230012001							66688764 Bytes	3887	5717	1730653327	RGB	8	600	asu06600000230012001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1256	1256	1257.jp2	/asu0660/image/1257.jp2

Of Davies he says only that he liked him  "enormously," followed by a description of his "diggings in  Avery Row, Brook Street where he lived above a laundry establishment."  It was the archeologist David George Hogarth who suggested  Theodore do a portrait of Charles Doughty who was relatively  unknown at that time. Theodore readily admits he had never  heard of him, but after reading Arabia Desert a his perceptive  judgment immediately recognized "what a very great writer he  was." Stewart Sherman was also favorably impressed. In his  Men of Letters essay which Theodore considers among his most  charming, he wrote:  Charles M. Doughty, an almost incredible survivor of the  world's heroic age, is an English traveller and poet of patriarchal imagination and aspect who, in 1888, came into English literature riding on a camel out of the Arabian desert and  bearing in his saddle bags such a record of his wanderings  as Boswell might have written had he been a companion of  Moses in the exodus from Egypt.  The portrait medallion, subsequently much admired, was mounted by Mrs. Doughty on her husband's funeral urn at Golders  Green.  The Irish Venture  With the perspective and hindsight of history it is difficult  today to understand how Theodore could have undertaken so  hazardous an assignment as seeking out subjects in Ireland in  1922. He was well-read, hence aware of the conflict tearing the  country apart. He knew the tragic consequences of rebellion  and strife, having fled before their onslaught in 1914 and returned less than seven years earlier to experience the unhappy  aftermath of war. Yet he was willing to risk his life and Margaret's by going to Dublin. Was he naive, misinformed, confident  perhaps of a special destiny for which he believed himself chosen,  or was the obsession to round out his literally gallery too powerful to ignore?  By the spring of 1922 Dublin, along with the rest of Ireland,  had already experienced several years of internal conflict. Acts  of violence and arson were frequent.

Yet, upon the invitation of their long-standing friend,  James Stephens, Theodore and Margaret accepted the offer to  stay in the Stephens' apartment while he and his family were  out of the city. Stephens had written, "Don't mind the stuff in  the papers about conditions here, there is little disturbance . . ."  So in early spring they crossed to Dublin. Although barricade  mattresses were still hanging from the windows of some official  buildings and the fronts of the buildings were stacked with sandbags through which rifle muzzles projected, these outward evidences seem only to have stimulated Theodore into the pursuit  of non-literary subjects. One of the first portraits he made was  of Michael Collins, acclaimed by some as the greatest Irishman  who ever lived.  Of this encounter with a high-ranking military and political  leader second only to Andrew Griffith, Theodore is strangely  noncommital. He recounts briefly that "We invited him to lunch  and he sneaked out of the back door of the War Office to avoid  political enemies. After lunch he posed for me and our chat was  mostly about dogs, for he had a great fondness for them." Much  is left unsaid. By what power of persuasion would the leader  of the I.R.A. suspend his duties at the request of an artist unknown to him? Who was Theodore's ambassador? The weight  of evidence seems to favor Oliver St. John Gogarty. Yet, regarding Gogarty, Theodore says not a single word. The assumption  can be drawn that Theodore met Gogarty through James Stephens. There is no doubt that they met and became friends. A  portrait medallion is proof, and there is correspondence from  Gogarty to Spicer-Simson. These letters are in the collection of  the University of Miami Library. Permission for their inclusion  herewith has been granted by Oliver David Gogarty, the elder  son of St. John.  Theodore worked rapidly, so in a matter of weeks he had  completed sketches and preliminary work on the Irish portraits  and had hurried back to his Paris studio to cast the medallions.  Gogarty acknowledges his approval of Theodore's art by promoting it among friends and colleagues.  16 	asu06600000230018001							66685464 Bytes	3908	5686	2501354000	RGB	8	600	asu06600000230018001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1262	1262	1263.jp2	/asu0660/image/1263.jp2

The enclosed from Lady Dunsany. [Enclosure is lacking] If you  think of going there, do not mention Collins at all or what he  stands for. Yeats may be named pensively. He took £400 from  Dunsany for his theatre and then elbowed out his plays to make  room for Lady Gregory's! I sent your address, and a note.  Collins (probably Grosvenor Hotel) will get you Griffith, if  you want him. Very kindly let me know when the "AE" is about  to be cast, & I will send you a cheque for ten guineas.  We are both so sorry you left— A friend has lent us a car.  When will we see you both again?  Yours sincerely  Oliver Gogarty  A post script is appended on the left border of first page  of this letter:  When will you release the news of the Collins sitting for "Daily  Mail"? J.M.N. Jeffries was here. He is a school friend of mine.  All the Americans are here at times.  In his next letter Gogarty reflects some of the stress of the times  and apprehension over the fate of his estate Renvyle on the edge  of the Atlantic in Connemara.  15, Ely Place, Dublin.  27-VII-1922  Dear Mrs. Spicer-Simson  I apologize for delay in answering your last letter and your  husband's. He got Collins in good time. Now that he is on all  fronts he could not have sat. His letter on Dunsany amused us  very much. In spite of his hunger for fame, he does not appreciate  the means of preserving himself; bronze that outlives the throne  (and the Peerage!)  I hope to get you others of that series of books. They are out  of reach here at present though not out of print.  Dublin is quiet but our country place may not exist just now.  We have not heard for a month. It will take years to fix this  country up.  Do you know of any place near Havre Normandy or Brittany  where one could walk bare-footed on the sand? Some place with  only a few houses. There's a direct line to run from Dublin to  Havre in August and as I cannot go to Connemara I am thinking  of lying hid in some out of the way part of Normandy or Brittany.

Kind regards to you two  Sincerely yours  Oliver Gogarty  Did T.S.S. ever get the specimens of handwriting analyzed.  Double tragedy struck in the ensuing month. On August 12th  Arthur Griffith died, worn out and exhausted. Ten days later  Michael Collins was killed in ambush by a shot in the back of  the head. The loss of these esteemed friends, particularly Collins,  plunged Gogarty into deep grief and depression.  15, Ely Place, Dublin.  31: VIII: 1922  My dear Spicer-Simson  I received your medallions: two of Collins, one of myself —  the second one of Collins came today. I send £10 for one of  Collins & one of myself. I will ask whoever buys the second one  of Collins to write directly to you. I have the very great pleasure  of sending you £20 by a cheque which I have crossed.  I have had a death mask of Collins taken; it goes back to the  ears and it has turned out rather successfully. Seen with the light  behind the head the full chin rolls out like a Greek face of the  best period. The planes of the forehead are straight and smooth.  It has occurred to me that if I were to send this to you or take  it to you to Paris with the knowledge you have of Collins lineaments you might contrive a bronze head life size. The eyes could  be opened & filled as full as life and the lids half raised as if they  were falling slowly during his peculiar gaze. The back of the head  could be added from your photographs & memory. It seems possible to my lack of experience anyway. Is it? And if you think  well of it, I will give you the cost & pay for one reproduction in  bronze, you can then produce a few for America for yourself.  Here there is no art. That is what makes Collins loss so poignant  and worse than Griffith's whose work was full and accomplished.  Collins would have done great things for Art where it is needed.  I am delighted that he sat for you and had the good fortune  to meet you. Keep the fact of this project of mine a secret.  Kindest regards to you two  Sincerely yours  Oliver Gogarty  By November Theodore was preparing for departure to New  York to complete arrangements for the publication of his Men  of Letters. In Gogarty's November 8th letter he seems to have  regained some of his vitality and trenchant humor.  •  18 	asu06600000230020001							67254784 Bytes	3920	5717	3081592419	RGB	8	600	asu06600000230020001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1264	1264	1265.jp2	/asu0660/image/1265.jp2

Theodore Spicer-Simson, 1871-1959					Rosner, George W.																											asu0660000023	15, Ely Place, Dublin.  8.XI.1922  My dear Spicer-Simson. As I lost your last letter I could not find  your address, therefore I welcome yours of this morning all the  more, and I answer it at once to avoid delay and forgetfulness.  From the photographs you so very kindly sent me I judge first,  that the tuft of hair over the brow should be made to appear less  tufty but be given more of a sweep. I know that it is not a finished  cast, but that when it is: then the collar should come off and the  tie too, for they make his head look too big. There must be some  way known to your brotherhood of getting over the difficulties  of necks, neckties and costumes; otherwise the beheaded who in  time become heroes, could never find plastic fame! But I am sorry  to judge from what you write that Collins is not popular enough  to give rise to a demand. Regarding his mask, I will be advised  by you and wait your return to Paris in April. By the way, while  you are in New York do not fail to make yourself known to  Croker's Jewish friend Strauss. He is interested in sterilizing milk  if not Art and he wrote to me saying that he would leave the  matter in abeyance; till your arrival. — I have found his letter  which I send with this.  There is Ernest Boyd too who will be able to help you. He is  a journalist but a cultivated man, and he knows all there is to be  known about Art, Ireland and its literature. He will love to talk  Joyce with you. I of course knew Joyce intimately. I think he  is ... a psychosthene — I have coined the word — not a psycho-  esthete, but a psychosthene which means a fellow with a skinny  soul. Alcohol syphilis will cause much photophobia but in Germany anyone who gave the name rheumatic to cover the want of  a diagnosis was regarded as an imposter or an ignoramus in matters medical. Will you very kindly let me have the name of a gem  cutter in Paris & address if you remember one. I want to have my  crest cut in a seal stone so that like Petronius I may have a seal  ring to break "lest it be used for imperilling others"!  I will speak to Yeats. The other night he remarked that the  publishers had given him only 3 copies for himself and he is too  poor to buy others. I am sure he has already parted with his 3;  but there will be a second, less worthy edition. John Quinn (I  have added an "n" for euphony!) sounds most uninteresting but  what does he expect more of Nature. That is the worst of barristers  in Art; barbarians had a sincerer and just as helpful an attitude.  For all their pretensions here, the barristers let the most palatial  street of Georgian XVIII Century Dublin fall into slums, night  refuges & ruins. They are sickly poseurs and barren rogues: all  they touch becomes boring, like Birrell's prose.  Germany was most interesting. I was rather weighed down with  my companion, but he brought me back and that was a good thing  though here just now it seems open to doubt . . .  Sincerely yours Oliver StJ.

Maintaining his medical practice in Dublin became increasingly difficult. No less than eight soldiers guarded his consulting rooms and he had been ordered by the Government to  carry a revolver at all times. In May he moved to London and  with the help of friends he soon developed a profitable practice.  15, Ely Place, Dublin.  19.V.1923  My dear Spicer Simson: If you can "thole" to be kept waiting for  your money for some months, by which time I hope again to be  prosperous, send along the bronze of Bridges to  The Provost  Worcester College  Oxford  and tell him that by Bridges' permission I am presenting it to the  library & to the College. I was entertained well in Oxford last  month. I go there again to Garsington Manor Lady Ottoline Mor-  rell's on this day week. Yeats & Bridges will be there.  I have opened an office in 20 Grosvenor St. where I gave the  books to your sister but I failed to see her owing to people taking  up the time at which she called. So I left them for her. My own  bronze is at Oxford: Safer so!  Things are well here. Financially things seem to be undisturbed  by politics: but I wish all the politicos could be sent to Ngoro  Ngoro or some such "gamey" place  • • •  I do several days — mid week days in London, and spend the  week ends from Friday to Monday here. It's hard work but there's  so much to be developed in London that I cannot afford not to  benefit, and I am beginning to make a London name. That is about  £150 per month. Here things are much as usual but I had 5  months interruption of income. Renvyle of course was burned by  the patriots whose idea of liberty is Ireland a ranch, dissatisfaction  and dirty boots. We are stopping them at last. An epidemic is what  is now required. The Importance of being Mrs. Ernest is beginning to be borne in on you! Stephens is a bad correspondent. Kind  regards to you & your wife. We may see you in France this Summer. Write soon again.  Yours sincerely Oliver Gogarty  Upon being informed of the imminent publication of Theodore's  book, Gogarty made a last minute plea to be included. He was  not. Theodore does not say why.  •  22 	asu06600000230024001							66538932 Bytes	3896	5691	101567921	RGB	8	600	asu06600000230024001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1268	1268	1269.jp2	/asu0660/image/1269.jp2

Here is Yeats appraisal. That ought to entitle me to be considered "a writer" in Ireland — though that title  in Scotland would mean a solicitor.  I have had three Plays produced in the Abbey — have been asked  by the Board of T.C.D. [Trinity College, Dublin] to write the Ode  on the Bi-Centenary of the Medical School and by the Irish Government to write the libretto for the musical competition of the  Taillteann games. This might sound immodest, this asking to be  included in your Helicon were it not that I see St. John-Irvine [sic]  there. It becomes condescension -— Forgive me.  I will be able to send you the cheque sooner than you think. As  soon as I find my cheque-book. I have repullulated again: Broad  leaves! In London I practise two days a week. I will ring up Hoare  when I cross over on Tuesday.  Don't fail to send a notice of your book to the Lord Dunsany,  Dunstall Priory, Shoreham, Kent. He will be sure to go in for an  Edition de Luxe. He is writing another Romance and has a play  on the thyroid gland coming out this Autumn. Don't let him know  or dream that you got either his address, or word of his play or  even a letter from me.  He nearly sacked his agent for divulging the thyroid business,  though he forgets that his style cannot be pirated and that's the  principal thing! Whether you put me in or not of course really  doesn't matter.  It is rather inordinate to expect it when the book is all but  issued. You can write the notice yourself if there be still time.

After doing portraits of Gogarty and Collins, Theodore went  from the unrest of Dublin to the quiet countryside of Galway  to meet Yeats. Once again James Stephens was the intermediary.  Acknowledging Theodore's appointment, Yeats suggested that  Lady Gregory be persuaded to sit for a portrait, too. Thus it  came about that Theodore was invited to Coole Park, Gort, to  be Lady Gregory's guest while he did the medallion of Yeats  who lived nearby. He was enchanted by the aristocratic atmosphere.

(carefully noting, lest there be a doubt, George Bernard Shaw) and near  those of Sir William Orpen and Augustus John. It was Yeats'  practice to sit for the portrait at Coole Park. Only once did  Theodore go to the Yeats' home at Ballyless. Always eager to  claim recognition and friendship with important personages,  Theodore makes no such claim in this case.  By contrast, Theodore's relationship with James Joyce was  long and satisfying. He first met Joyce through Stephen McKenna  as early as 1908 or 1909 "before he became famous." Joyce,  then a newspaper correspondent, frequently visited the Spicer-  Simsons in their Paris studio. Theodore recalls a letter from  Joyce in which in 1910 he tells of the beginning of the inflama-  tion of the eye which later developed into almost total blindness.  By 1922 Joyce's condition had considerably worsened. In August he wrote Theodore apologizing for being unable to sit for a  portrait. He was under doctors' care in both London and Paris  and greatly dreaded the possibility of an operation. He suggested  that Theodore do a portrait for inclusion in the "Men of Letters"  from sketches and photographs available from his publishers  who had made them prior to the publication of Ulysses.  But Joyce did finally sit for his portrait. Theodore relates the  circumstances: "At twilight one evening my wife, who was alone,  heard somebody stumbling on the small landing outside the  studio. She opened the door and a very gloomy-looking man  stood speechless for a few seconds, then said, 'Does Spicer-  Simson live here? I am James Joyce.' He came in as Margaret  told him I was expected any moment, and remarked, 'Your  staircase is very dark and difficult to climb.' Margy explained  that the low building dated from the 18th century, and part  of it was over the catacombs. She added that this might explain  the frequency of rats, and to frighten them a stout stick was  kept handy in a corner of the stairway to bang on the steps.  Straightening up suddenly Joyce exclaimed, 'Are there rats  here?' 'Sometimes,' she answered. 'How horrible!' said Joyce,  shuddering. Nevertheless, he came several times to sit for me . . .  He was then almost blind."  • 24 	asu06600000230026001							66571568 Bytes	3889	5704	2754147913	RGB	8	600	asu06600000230026001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1270	1270	1271.jp2	/asu0660/image/1271.jp2

W.H. Hudson: Monuments to His Green World					Douglas, Marjory Stoneman																											asu0660000027	THE  CARRE LL  Volume    15 1974  W. H. Hudson:  Monuments to His Green World  MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS  Crowds of people, large even for a May morning in 1925  had begun early to flock into London's Hyde Park. Most  were drawn by curiosity to see the Prime Minister, Mr.  Stanley Baldwin, unveil a monument by the sculptor, Jacob  Epstein, about whom there had been already a hot controversy  in the London newspapers.  His Majesty George the Fifth, as Royal Ranger of the (Royal)  Parks, had graciously consented to the site, a proposed Bird  Sanctuary, an acre or so of woody thicket above a slope to the  north, facing the Bridle Path and the shine of Serpentine water  below. The distinguished Committee which had asked for the  site and mounted a world-wide public appeal for funds, with  Mr. Hugh J. Dent as Honorable Treasurer, was headed by the  fiery Scottish Baronet, Robert B. Cunningham-Graham with,  among others, Lord Grey of Fallodon, Lord Buxton, John  Galsworthy, Mr. Muirhead Bone. Money had come in from all  over the British Isles, the United States, Argentina and everywhere else.  It was the fixed policy of H. M. Office of Public Works not to  allow the representation of any individual in the Royal Parks.  An imaginary subject was therefore chosen, called "Rima", the  central figure of the strange book Green Mansions, which the  English people had not at first cared for but which later had had  a great success in the United States. Rima was an illusive and  solitary  figure, more bird than woman, a dweller among the 	asu06600000270003001							69058056 Bytes	4000	5753	2129763453	RGB	8	600	asu06600000270003001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1276	1276	1277.jp2	/asu0660/image/1277.jp2

It would be the second memorial in Hyde Park with a purely  imaginary subject. (The first was the Peter Pan fountain.) It was  hardly noticed by the crowds pushing and staring over the ornamental iron fence to the temporary platform, already filling  with silk-hatted men in morning coats, that on the coping of the  first three long rectangular birdbaths between them and the  canvas-covered screen against the trees, were carved the words,  "In Memory of W.H. Hudson, Writer and Field Naturalist." Perhaps no one but the man himself would have thought that it  was an extraordinary thing for his name to have been there at  all.  He had died nearly three years before, in August 1922. He  was the author of twenty-three books, five laid in South America and the rest in England, and dozens of articles in British  magazines about birds and other wild creatures and about the  destruction of so much natural beauty by the modern world. He  had corresponded with thousands of people everywhere who  asked questions about wild and natural things, to which he had  replied with unfailing care and friendliness they never forgot.  He had been written about in the books of dozens of his  contemporaries, many of whom considered him one of the leading English stylists of that day, as well as the naturalist who had  spent his forty-eight years in England writing and working for  the protection not only of British birds but of birds everywhere.  It was said that he alone, among a very few early nature writers,  had brought to scientists a new way of thinking about birds and  to the public in general a new awareness of the value of endangered nature as the beautiful basic wealth of mankind.  In Hyde Park that morning the crowds jostled closer. Music  was played. Stanley Baldwin, following the presentation of the  Bird Sanctuary and Monument by the Chairman, Robert B.  Cunninghame Graham, spoke of the man to whom it was being  dedicated as "a rare and remarkable spirit", who had landed in  England many years before, "unknown, unheralded, unadver-  tised." At the end of his suave and gracious speech he said, "It  behoves us all to act because of that love which exists in English  people wherever they may be found, the love and craving for 	asu06600000270004001							67820000 Bytes	3916	5771	1108633632	RGB	8	600	asu06600000270004001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1277	1277	1278.jp2	/asu0660/image/1278.jp2

We ought to do everything we can to foster  that spirit and it is in that belief that this day we are helping to  draw people's attention to bird life that I rejoice to be allowed  to unveil this memorial."  The Prime Minister leaned forward with a practiced gesture  to pull the correct rope. The canvas slowly slid away from the  carved screen. There was Rima in high relief in Portland stone,  surrounded by large stone birds. In the gasp and astonished  silence that followed, people in front of the Prime Minister saw  him wince, Cunninghame-Graham, behind him, said he saw a  shiver run down his impeccable back. A confusion of excited  sounds rose as people behind the staring row at the railings  struggled and shoved to get a nearer view.  Two young women, hurrying in belatedly from the Bays-  water Road Gate, heard the crowd muttering as they skirted the  thicket of the Bird Sanctuary but were stopped by the raised  palms of a large Park policeman who said, "There's no use you  trying to get nearer. You won't see anything—the crowd's too  thick. And if you did, you won't like it."  It was evident in weeks to come that most London people  did not like it. A hullabaloo broke out in the newspapers. "The  monument is obscene and should be taken out of the park  immediately," the Daily Mail insisted. A letter from the President of the Royal Academy demanding its removal was printed  in the Morning Post. The birds were shy of using the new bird-  baths because of the continuous trampling of people along the  path by the railing. A man in shabby clothing held out-of-door  meetings almost every day, haranguing the crowds, shaking his  finger at the carved panel and shouting, "Would you want your  sister depicted in this manner?" The speaker swore he would  speak every day from morning to night until the statue was  removed, The papers gave him unlimited publicity and people  brought him drinks and sandwiches to encourage him, until he  was quietly removed by the Park police. Vandals splashed the  panel with red paint.  In Parliament a member demanded that the terrible female  with paralysis of the hands called "Rima" be instantly removed.  A letter insisting on the same thing was printed in the Post, 	asu06600000270005001							68313044 Bytes	3972	5731	554674938	RGB	8	600	asu06600000270005001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1278	1278	1279.jp2	/asu0660/image/1279.jp2

They and others, it became known, had resigned,  not immediately because of the choice of the sculptor, Mr.  Jacob Epstein, but in protest against the first design he had  submitted. A discovered newspaper copy shows it to have been  fairly appalling. It featured Mr. Hudson himself, bearded and all  six feet three of him, crammed uncomfortably in a reclining  attitude in a lunette, his long thin trousered legs arranged  awkwardly in a sort of "W". It was pointed out that it resembled closely the strange position of Job in a similar lunette in  the North Portal of Chartres Cathedral, on one elbow with his  bare legs in the same sort of "W". It was undoubtedly fortunate  that the design could not be accepted in any case because of the  official rule against the representation of any individual in the  Royal Parks.  The second design of the Rima figure on which Mr. Epstein  worked in solitude all that foggy winter in his country studio  had been accepted by the staunch members of the original committee.  The existing monument was eventually saved by a long letter  the artist, Mr. Muirhead Bone, sent to Viscount Peel, H. M.  Commissioner of Public Works, explaining the necessity for the  panel's having been carved roughly and in high relief, because of  the inevitable wearing of the Portland stone by the rigors of  London weather and with certain features exaggerated because  too delicate detail could not be seen well from seventy feet  away outside the railings.  Nothing was done and slowly the protests ceased. But while  the controversy raged in the press, many booksellers noted with  pleasure a rise in the demand for Hudson's books.  The high formal clipped hedges of the original site design  were never planted. The trees and bushes were allowed to grow  naturally and thickly behind the panel and around the open  grassy space where tiny English daisies are starred thickly in late 	asu06600000270006001							67580224 Bytes	3913	5755	2112461746	RGB	8	600	asu06600000270006001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1279	1279	1280.jp2	/asu0660/image/1280.jp2

There is a constant going and coming of wings and the shadows  of wings across the face of the carving, among the moving light  between the overhanging branches and their leaves. Today people strolling by on the path outside the railings glance over  casually at birds and carving and the long shallow rectangles of  water reflecting the sky. It is all in harmony. Mothers sitting on  benches that turn their backs to it gaze down the slope under  the trees and watch their children playing. Young men toss balls  or frisbies. Lovers meet "at the Rima monument" and, touching  hands, do not see it at all.  It is difficult now to see in the Epstein panel that the Bird  Sanctuary claims as its own what shocked all those people in  1925. It is the stylized figure in high relief of a gaunt girl, naked  and awkward as a new-hatched bird, with a face that near-to  seems rough and heavy, straining upward with blind eyes. Her  small breasts are sharp as the points of her ribcage, the bones of  hip and pelvis hardly fleshed at all. Her thin arms and curious  hands like great bird claws are held up in the strange "W" shape  that seems from the first to have haunted the sculptor. But now  the "W" is the thin shape of wing bones before the feathers  have begun to grow. This is the young Rima, a naked nestling  yearning for the skies.  The space around her is filled with carvings of great heavy  birds, her companions. Their feathered wings are not yet lifted,  their long necks strain awkwardly upward as if answering the  cries of some flock of their kindred, passing high overhead. In  another moment they, too, perhaps taking her with them, will  be gone.  From beyond the railings, as the sculptor planned it, the  whole thing is softened and lightened by the passing shadows,  the changing light, the streak and clouding of sun, the bright  splashings of water from the living birds. The shadows of bare  branches move across it in autumn winds or the snow light of  winter, as heavy as the stone uplifted arms. In a glisten of rain  the carved shapes tremble a little as if the patterns of the weather-softened stone are no more than branches themselves. Perhaps she is not a bird but a girl growing into a bird-haunted tree. 	asu06600000270007001							67212528 Bytes	3908	5731	1226491441	RGB	8	600	asu06600000270007001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1280	1280	1281.jp2	/asu0660/image/1281.jp2
W.H. Hudson: Monuments to His Green World					Douglas, Marjory Stoneman																											asu0660000027	There are moments when the tangled shadows of the carving are  like the shadows of a deep jungle in which the yearning shapes  of stone birds and stone girl are together lost.  If the man himself whose unnoticed name is on the coping of  the nearest pool could stand there in some early morning when  the bird watchers are moving quietly about, taking him for  granted, he would surely be amused by all this. He could easily  tell the others how many species of birds were already nesting  in the dense thicket beyond. He would know them all, beginning with his own birds, the London sparrows hanging and twittering finch-like over the water gleaming in the dawn. He would  know every thrush, the rare kingfisher, the nutcracker and the  jay, the great tit, the blue tit and the coal tit, the tree-creepers,  the whinchat, the black-cap, the goldfinches and the linnets in  their season.  He could whistle their songs to them so purely and accurately  that they would pause and cock their heads and their bright  eyes, moving erratically nearer until alarmed by something they,  especially the sparrows, would be off in an explosion of  feathers.  He would linger in the early summer light to see strong-  winged migrants using the green chain of London parks from  west to east as he once described them, as a short cut fly-way  across the huge sprawl of city in the air clearer than any he  remembered here. They might drop down and bathe and drink  and preen on their way to some far place that called them, as he  too, had been called.  He would surely glance over from time to time in deep  amusement at the gaunt stone girl another man had made out of  his imaginings. This awkward, unhappy nestling may not have  been the image in the forest he had carried in his mind so long.  But as he looked, in those changing moments, he might have  seen what the other man had seen, the unfledged child of his  creation. Surely he would have lingered to watch her and grow  fond.  There is another kind of memorial in London, almost unnoticed, totally forgotten: a small plaque on a strange grim house  on the Nottinghill side of the street that divides it from Pad-  dington. The address is no. 40, St. Luke's Road.

Its square tower shape rises up beside the few  straggling elm trees that have managed to survive since he came  here to live. It was his home for the greater part of his life in  London, the place where he wrote almost all his books and  carried on his enormous correspondence. Up there behind the  now dusty windows of the third floor is the room where he  died.  The plaque, which bears a representation of his birthplace in  the Argentine, was placed here, with the permission of the British Government, by a delegation of "Los Amigos de Hudson"  from the Argentine. Nobody notices it. Hardly any one of the  occupants of the flats into which the shabby, half-deserted  house was long ago divided know it is there or that anyone  called Hudson ever lived there.  He is buried in a grave beside his wife's, under a pine tree by  the wall of Broadwater Cemetery in Worthing in the South of  England. On the base of the monument he had carved, "I will  never fail thee." This has caused some unnecessary wonderment. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, his chief  heir, set up after some contention a large white cross like that  of Richard Jeffries' in the same cemetery. On the coping of  Hudson's grave a quotation was carved composed by the ladies  of R.S.P.B. from George Borrow and a popular contemporary  author: "He loved birds and green places, and the wind on the  heath, and saw the brightness of the skirts of God." Few people  visit it. Somehow the place lacks meaning except that it lies  under the silence of pine needles.  A simpler gravestone in the old village of Martin in Wiltshire,  once within the changed border of Hampshire, seems a more  living memorial. Hudson loved the place and the one-storey  farmhouse where he liked to stay, opposite the old church on a  little hill, because the old house and the treeless country around  seemed much like his beloved home in the Argentine.  In the book he wrote with this background, one of the finest  of his writings about England, he called it "Winterbourne Bishop." An old gray headstone, patched like the church with yellow lichens, high up in the churchyard on the hill bears the  inscription "In loving memory of William Lawes."

W.H. Hudson: Monuments to His Green World					Douglas, Marjory Stoneman																											asu0660000027	his death was 1886 and he was 86 years old. He was Hudson's  friend. A small sign before the stone reads: "William Lawes was  the original of the character of Caleb Bawcombe in W. H. Hudson's book, A Shepherd's Life. "  The most inconspicuous, least known monument to Hudson  in all England, the monument haunted by and surely the most  appropriate to the man, is hidden away on the rough coast of  Cornwall, where Hudson spent many of his last winters. A few  of his devoted friends, H. J. Massingham, Alfred Hartley the  painter he had known for nearly thirty years, and Hudson's  determined patroness, that impressive woman, the Ranee of  Sarawak, were looking for the right place for a memorial to  him. They found it—whether the Ranee managed to climb all  the way or not—topping a great lifting to high over the empty  road between St. Ives and Land's End, above the small stone  village of Zennor, whose church keeps safely the old carving of  the Cornish mermaid. Hudson loved to stay there, tramping  around the countryside.  Up there beyond the scattered rocks of the steepest slope,  among the golden burning of the furze that of all plants indigenous to England delighted him most, high up among boulders  worn and tossed about by time and bitter weathers, they found  a great rock looming like a wall above a sheltered flat stone  where a man could sit in the sun. His long legs in that effortless  stride people spoke of as "like a great cat's," often carried him  up hill between rocks and furze-clumps to where he sat alone,  and almost motionless, as only he knew how to sit, for hours at  a time.  High over the lowest land, patched with small, stone-walled  fields, over the roofs and square church tower of Zennor, over  the downs swelling southward, he faced the enormous expanse  of ocean. He had insisted it was the bluest of any sea about the  British Isle; a rare, soft misty blue, the blue of hyacinths, blue  to the remote edge of the paler sky. He might have climbed in  fog that so often shrouds this coast with mystery and legend,  shutting in to a grayness that damped his beard and heavy coat  and left the taste of salt on his lips. Sitting on his rock he would  be shut in with thick blowing gray out of which the curious  gulls flapped in whiteness to drop to his high rock to stare down  8  '^gatKmr^m 	asu06600000270010001							67284224 Bytes	3904	5743	1747773942	RGB	8	600	asu06600000270010001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1283	1283	1284.jp2	/asu0660/image/1284.jp2

The little common birds of England, tits and dunnocks, huddling on this coast  for warmth from the northeast cold, hopped and cheeped about  his feet as he waited for rarer birds to find this shelter. But  when the fog thinned and the blue vast fields of that eternal  ocean-sea were revealed again, his eyes would surely have been  searching the horizon.  For beyond that stupendous curve of the earth his mind had  already gone out again to that other land and coast down half  the rest of the globe that he saw so plainly. This was his own  Land's End, his place of ultimate pilgrimage. It was like that  one beyond on the last black rocks washed over by Atlantic  foam that he had already written about, where he had seen the  faces of old men from all over Britain sitting motionless and  staring, yearning for something out there they could never  know. With him it was different. He knew what he had known  there, far, far away and long ago, so that his longing was older  and more real. As he has intimated, all his years shut in on this  ancient island that he had chosen and grown fond of and refused to leave were years of exile from that other place.  Far away where his searching thoughts so often found their  home, there is another monument to him that is perhaps the  most used, the most alive, of them all. It is set in the Argentine  pampas some miles from Buenos Aires that has spread out greatly toward it in all these years since his birth, in the old place  called Los Veinte-cinco Ombues or translated as "The Twenty-  five Omber Trees." These few acres on a rise of ground overlook  a little stream known always as "Conchitas." Beyond, the level  land once swept uninterrupted to a horizon like the seas. Near  the sturdy small three-roomed house in which he was born—the  sleeping house among the cluster of other small buildings of his  North American father's rancho—there is still at this writing one  great stump left of the nearest ancient omber tree, among  whose great roots he and his brothers and sisters played as  children. It is the last of the great avenue of ombus that  stretched downhill to the once single old highway from Buenos  Aires to the south.

By them and by an increasing number of Argentine people, W.H. Hudson has been recognized as one of the few great writers of the Argentine, even  though he wrote in English. In 1947 they persuaded the owner  of the land, Viscount Francis Davidson, to donate it to the  Argentine government as a memorial. It is maintained under the  Department of Education as a Memorial Park and Bird Sanctuary, with the small bedroom building as a museum, called  Museo y Parque Evocativo with Hudson's own greatniece, Miss  Violeta G. Shinya, an educator, as its Director, with a committee of Los Amigos de Hudson as its Trustees.  Another ombu tree planted at that time has grown enormously over its buttressed roots in the place where the kitchen  building, the center of Hudson family life, used to stand. The  ovenbird, "the hornero", the children's favorite, still makes his  curiously secure mudnest, like a small earthen mailbox, on its  jagged branches. Birds constantly fly between the green thicket  by the side road and the little river. The bien-te-veo, the viudito,  the woodpecker they call here El carpintero still call and whistle  and knock as they always did when Hudson knew them. The  young wrens twitter in their nests under the same old eaves.  There is a lovely quiet here under the self-same winds from  great distances.  There is, to be sure, in an open space among neat flower  beds, a staring white bust supposed to look like W.H. Hudson  but resembling much more some heavy bearded Homer in a  collar and tie. The quiet of the place, where an old caretaker  potters about, is broken from time to time by a cheerful racket  of schoolchildren in their white school coveralls, who explode  from busses to go running and whooping about, wildly happy  with freedom from school walls and town streets. They gather,  with the sudden decorum of Argentine children, to listen to  lectures about Hudson, his birds and his books, especially his  fine autobiography of ten years of his boyhood in the pampas,  Far Away and Long Ago, which they read as school classics  translated into Spanish.  Unless they stumble over it in the long grass, they hardly  notice, in their running games, the small memorial stone that is  10 	asu06600000270012001							67178388 Bytes	3919	5712	2099532931	RGB	8	600	asu06600000270012001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1285	1285	1286.jp2	/asu0660/image/1286.jp2

It is low, square and  white with a slanting upper face, deeply incised, almost crude,  in the fashion of the London "Rima". It is only a stone bird  and some leaves. The carved words say, "El arbol y el pajaro  conocen la purezza de su espiritu," which means, so rightly,  "The tree and the bird know the purity of his spirit."  In his years in England Hudson sustained an enormous correspondence with people everywhere, chiefly about wildlife,  which he was careful to answer warmly and in detail. In his  wanderings about the south of England he constantly wrote  letters to his friends, many on the staff of the R.S.P.B. Yet it is  part of his legend that he destroyed all his letters in his last  years, so that it is impossible to know anything about him. This,  on the face of it, is ridiculous.  At the lodge of the R.S.P.B. at Sandy in Bedfordshire to  which the Society migrated from its old offices in London some  years ago, the librarian, Miss Dorothy Rook, hunting about in  the cellar for records still packed in travelling boxes, found  packages of Hudson material with the undisturbed dust of years  on them; reports, documents, business papers, a few photographs and piles of Hudson letters. These, with the files and  periodicals of the Society, give the clearest possible base for a  view of Hudson's wise, devoted and practical work for bird  protection: the history of the series of Plumage Bills for the  passage of which he did so much as a director, a member of the  Publication committee, a writer of a great series of pamphlets  on endangered birds, which with newspaper files and his voluminous personal letters, make an invaluable contribution.  The Society owns a huge, rather oppressive portrait in oil,  copied from a photograph, of Hudson crouching in a field with  binoculars, in a Norfolk jacket, high-standing collar and a villainous-looking woolen cap, the same surely which he wrote had  frightened some birds. There is also his huge old bookcase from  40, St. Luke's Road, which was left to them, still mortgaged. It  was the only piece of furniture that was not falling to pieces;  and a fine collection of many editions of his books.  The whole work of the R.S.P.B. is his greatest living monument. He joined the Society a year or two after it was begun by  a small group of women struggling against the wholesale slaugh-  11 	asu06600000270013001							67589636 Bytes	3943	5712	934700759	RGB	8	600	asu06600000270013001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1286	1286	1287.jp2	/asu0660/image/1287.jp2

Besides  the Plumage Bills and the pamphlets, he was most interested in  the work of the "Bird and Tree" Competition, his own idea,  which brought to generations of British schoolchildren a new  concept of the value and beauty of their native birds. He loved  to go around with a magic lantern, showing the children pictures of birds and whistling their songs. For years he enjoyed  reading their essays and awarding the prizes. Nothing less than  the re-education of the whole British people regarding wildlife  protection (including the conversion of egg-and-skin collectors)  was his great aim. This was achieved to a large extent. At the  end of his life he struggled to extract every cent he could from  his British and American publishers to leave to the R.S.P.B., the  sole heir of his estate (aside from a few minor bequests), which  he specified must be used to continue educational work with  children.  As to letters, his latest and greatest English publisher, J.M.  Dent, also discovered in their files a fine series of letters from  Hudson to all sorts of people, collected probably for a book of  Hudson letters planned after the Collected Edition was published. Many other letters owned by the heirs of people who  wrote him turn up in England, pasted in second-hand copies of  his books.  But it is in the United States that other important collections  of his letters and early editions of his works have been purchased in England chiefly for university libraries. Ninety letters  to his friend William Rothenstein, the portrait painter, are to be  found in the Houghton Memorial Library of Harvard University.  The Rare Book room of the libraries of Dartmouth College in  New Hampshire has the originals of the letters to Edward  Garnett as well as many others, the first edition of the book in  which they were printed as well as Hudson's own books, and a  fine pencil drawing of him by Rothenstein. The Berg Collection  in the New York Public Library has a number of miscellaneous  letters to Hudson, some pasted in copies of his books. The W.  H. Hudson-George Mathew Adams Collection in the rare book  department of the University of Michigan Library at Ann Arbor  has a good number of Hudson letters and first editions. There is,  or was, one letter in the library of the University of Virginia and  12 	asu06600000270014001							67010928 Bytes	3899	5727	3639591599	RGB	8	600	asu06600000270014001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1287	1287	1288.jp2	/asu0660/image/1288.jp2

Collections of Hudsoniana are being made for the rare book  department of the Wellesley College Library in Massachusetts  and for the Special Collections of the University of Miami Library in Florida.  In New York, both E. P. Dutton, the enthusiasm of whose  early editor, John Macrae, introduced several Hudson books in  the United States and Mr. Alfred A. Knopf, whose printing of  Green Mansions brought Hudson his first financial success, have  preserved carefully their extensive correspondence from Hudson. Mr. Knopf, indeed, is probably the only person alive now  in the United States who met Hudson several times on business  trips to London and who remembers him vividly. A series of  letters from Hudson to the Ranee of Sarawak were sold a year  or two ago in the United States to an excellent private collection of Hudson books and letters.  The portrait in oils of Hudson by William Rothenstein is  owned by the National Portrait Gallery in London as well as the  fine bronze portrait medallion by Theodore Spicer-Simson. The  second existing replica of this medallion is included in the large  Spicer-Simson Collection in the University of Miami Library.  In Washington, the archives of the Smithsonian Institution  have for years treasured the earliest of Hudson's correspondence  with Prof. Spencer F. Baird, Assistant Secretary in the 1860's,  who encouraged Hudson to begin collecting bird skins. They  have Baird's letters to him also, along with the bird skins they  bought from him with those records, and the earliest known  photograph of Hudson as a young man in the Argentine. The  Smithsonian also has copies of the Hudson articles printed in  the Proceedings of the London Zoological Society and the letters of their Secretary, Dr. Sclater, to Baird about the bird  skins. The Zoological Society has many originals of these articles, together with at least one Hudson letter to Sclater.  In England today there are several men still living who, as  boys, knew Hudson as their family friend and who have many  direct details and opinions of him and his wife to add to a  knowledge of this man who, in every case, seemed so distinguished and magnetic a person: Mr. David Garnett, Lord John  13 	asu06600000270015001							67701340 Bytes	3944	5720	2061993822	RGB	8	600	asu06600000270015001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1288	1288	1289.jp2	/asu0660/image/1289.jp2
W.H. Hudson: Monuments to His Green World					Douglas, Marjory Stoneman																											asu0660000027	Rothenstein and Lt. Col. (ret.) Richard Miller, whose father was  Hudson's physician in his Cornish winters. Mr. Frank Swin-  nerton remembers vividly in his year or two as office boy his  impression of Hudson waiting in the old office on Bedford  Street to see Mr. J. M. Dent, his publisher.  Another less widespread myth about W. H. Hudson has  grown up in more recent years among several generations of  younger, more modern and very professional ornithologists,  who were prejudiced by the opinions handed down to them by  the leading British ornithologists of Hudson's day and shocked  that Hudson, as an unknown and untrained young man in the  Argentine should have had the impertinence to question a statement in the Origin of Species by the great Charles Darwin himself. Darwin's retort, immortalized in a later edition, that Hud  son was probably right but no evolutionist (which was not true)  condemned him in the eyes of later scientific generations, as  only a "field naturalist" and a "sentimentalist."  Since in all his later years in England, Hudson claimed only  that he was a "field naturalist" in his constant battling with  what he felt was the dry-as-dust, academic laboratory ornithology and natural science of that day, nothing has challenged that  myth until recently.  It has been seen by such modern scientists as E. M. Nicholson, now Sir Max, the distinguished environmentalist, that in  view of Hudson's study of the habits, reactions, and as far as  possible without anthropomorphism, the emotions of birds and  other wild creatures as they lived in their natural habitats, "He  had an astonishing freedom from sentimentality—he had no sentimental weaknesses about birds." He was a realist, teaching a  new way of looking at nature.  It is clear that Hudson was the first of all bird-behaviorists,  before the word was invented, antedating by all his work, but  especially by the classic studies of Molothrus honariensis and of  the English cuckoo, the behavioral study of the pied-billed  grebe, first by Selous and then by Julian Huxley.  It was no one less than Hudson's warm and great friend Alfred Russell Wallace (writing in Nature in his and Hudson's  lifetime) who pointed out that Hudson was a great naturalist  who changed the thinking of people everywhere about birds by  14 	asu06600000270016001							67761492 Bytes	3942	5728	2033728212	RGB	8	600	asu06600000270016001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1289	1289	1290.jp2	/asu0660/image/1290.jp2
W.H. Hudson: Monuments to His Green World					Douglas, Marjory Stoneman																											asu0660000027	combining his genius as a naturalist with his genius as a writer.  Wallace wrote, "If he had remained strictly a naturalist he  would have remained almost unknown. He is the master of an  uncommon, and at its best, a magnificent English style. He  makes the fascination of natural history irresistible to lay people. He triumphs outside the field of insular ornithology because he was able to exercise such tremendous influence within  it."  Sir Max Nicholson, in his early book Birds in England, devoted an entire chapter to the work of W. H. Hudson. "He  was," he wrote, "a great naturalist of the magnificent mould  which turned out, besides, Charles Darwin and Alfred Russell  Wallace, and no one else." Hudson had a message, "which promises to be the greatest and most vital thing in the relations of  birds and man in England, for a long time to come." No one  before Hudson had made himself the authentic voice of nature.  By his genius the whole complex system becomes intelligible.  In his latest book, The Environmental Revolution, Sir Max  writes of his own youth. "After Gilbert White it was above all  W. H. Hudson who inspired and moulded my thoughts on nature from the age of twelve for nearly a decade." Because of his  study of Hudson as a master he felt himself equipped to maintain himself simply by writing about nature. That, of course, led  to his unequalled position as an environmentalist so that he  came to recognize Hudson himself as one of the very first of the  environmentalists, as others have placed him in position with  the North Americans, Thoreau, Burroughs and John Muir.  As to the work of bird protection, Sir Max writes, "The  scope of the movement was broadened and deepened by a remarkable immigrant from Argentina, W. H. Hudson, one of the  most outstanding writers on nature, and a fine, all-around naturalist. ... He laid the moral and intellectual foundation of a  more substantial movement in Britain for the protection of  wildlife, starting with birds, and bringing together sentiment  and science."  So finally, the Reading Room of the British Museum may be  considered the greatest and most lasting of Hudson monuments.  Its catalogues list dozens of books which contain references,  descriptions, comments, anecdotes, analyses of the man and the  15 	asu06600000270017001							67485820 Bytes	3928	5725	643922149	RGB	8	600	asu06600000270017001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1290	1290	1291.jp2	/asu0660/image/1291.jp2

There, also, are the files of all the newspapers and periodicals that printed articles, reviews, even obituaries. It is impossible to sample all this.  "Of all living authors—now that Tolstoi has gone I could least  dispense with W. H. Hudson." That was his friend John  Galsworthy, in the preface to the New York edition of Green  Mansions. And again, "As a simple narrator he is well-nigh unsurpassed; as a stylist he has few, if any, living equals. . . . His  work is a vision of natural beauty and of human life as it might  be, quickened and sweetened by the sun and the wind and the  rain, and by fellowship with all the other forms of life—the  truest vision now being given to us, who are more in want of it  than any generation has ever been.

This is a  w^ startling idea, even from such a source, for if there is  anything politics does not seem to resemble, it is poetry.  True, Horace and Vergil were occasionally seen in the company  of Caesar Augustus, and Robert Frost went sunblind at the  Kennedy inauguration. But these are merely the exceptions  (like Yeats amusing himself in the Irish Senate, or Lamartine  running for President of France) that prove the rule.  Let us consider the converse: "Poetry is politics." To my best  knowledge, no one has ever made such a statement, although  many poets, from Mayakovsky on, have tried to make their  poetry into politics. In fact, this practice appears to be on the  increase, although the results are usually fatal, at least to the  poetry:  Now France returns to the old barricades  banner of wrath unfurled  over tears newly dried.  Now you are not alone, Stalingrad.  And the mighty lions of England  speeding over hurricaned sea  drive their claws into the murky earth.  Now you are not alone, Stalingrad.  Far from  an identity, we would seem to have discovered an  antithesis.  Perhaps the problem can best be approached sub specie linguae. Poets and politicians have one thing in common: they  both work in words. For the poet, words are both the means  and end of his activity. The activity itself might best be described as a process of elimination. Poetic construction is not, as  some people think, "finding the right word," but rather, eliminating all the wrong ones, until finally the poet is left with the  17 	asu06600000270019001							67648224 Bytes	3932	5733	4060477318	RGB	8	600	asu06600000270019001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1292	1292	1293.jp2	/asu0660/image/1293.jp2
Poetry, Politics and Language					Zaller, Robert																											asu0660000027	irreducible minimum of his poem. That minimum may be many  words or few, but they must all be necessary. Cocteau once  remarked that all poets have their own vocabulary. There are  some words they are forbidden to use. He complained of how  few had been given to him; but his complaint was, of course, his  pride. Cocteau was simply calling himself a classicist.  I myself admire a poet who can conjure up  fatalist wishbones,  funnybones gone up in laughing gas,  astralagi from which the butterflies have flown,  innominate bones,  sacrums the eucharist-platters of kites,  and here and there a luz-bone dead of n on-resurrection  but there must be some words that even Galway Kinnell cannot use.  The truth-telling function of poetry was first pointed out by  Plato. "The poets lie too much," he said, meaning that they  should not. Truth-telling in poetry is perhaps the most subtle  and scrupulous of all human tasks. Because the words of the  poem are its truth, they are also its test. The poem cannot be  reduced to anything but itself. There is no empirical referent,  no 'objective correlative,' nothing but the best and most sensitive response of its best and most sensitive readers.  Wrong, false or superfluous words are like poisoned barnacles  on the poem. It takes only a very few, sometimes only one, to  destroy it. This is the difference between poetry and prose. A  writer like Mailer can surge, stumble, wallow, and still somehow  flail out what he wants to say. He muddies his own water but he  is still able to swim in it. There is no such margin for error in  poetry. Water you can wash in is not water you can drink.  Poetry can express the outrageous, the reprehensible, the absurd, but it cannot, in its own terms, lie. If it does so, it is not  poetry. Prose, however, is readily adaptable to falsehood. It is a  neutral instrument that can be bent to any use. It can prove or  persuade anything. Nothing can sully its integrity because it  possesses none, no more than a spoon or a hammer. It is simply  a tool. Poetry can very easily cease to be poetry, but prose is  impossible to destroy.  18 	asu06600000270020001							67644280 Bytes	3940	5721	1298020852	RGB	8	600	asu06600000270020001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1293	1293	1294.jp2	/asu0660/image/1294.jp2
Poetry, Politics and Language					Zaller, Robert																											asu0660000027	Everyone uses prose, the maid-of-all-work of the language,  and everyone lies with it. It is even possible to lie while announcing the fact beforehand. The Big Lie is Hitler's legacy to  political science, and has since become the modus operandi of  all modern nations.  That politicians lie is an axiom; that the politics of whole  nations may be a lie is, while attested by numerous examples, a  little more difficult to take in. Politics has become to such an  extent the matrix of our reality that to question the veracity of  their government has, for many people, become tantamount to  questioning the authenticity of their lives. I do not speak of the  "lie" of a privileged aristocracy that claims to represent the  divine order, or of a bourgeois cabal that claims to represent the  will of the people. I am talking about the systematic dissemination of deliberate, concrete falsehoods: of lies that are provably  lies. With her usual vigorous optimism, Hannah Arendt has argued that a lie is always inferior to the truth over the long run,  because it can never adequately cover the immense contingent  reality which the truth, in fact, embodies.3 But experience has  shown that those who expose the lies of their government can  expect little thanks, while the liars themselves are often rewarded with greater trust than ever. The lie, in short, becomes a  public complicity, and thus emerges with enhanced strength  from its confrontation with truth.  Truth and lies are both told through language. Most linguistic  statements tell neither; they use language neutrally, as it were,  stating matters of fact which are relatively accurate or inaccurate, correct or incorrect, but not true or false. This use of  language does nothing to it one way or another. But on certain  occasions a language is vitally affected by the way it is used.  When truth is told through it, it is renewed, enhanced, extended; when lies are told, it is impoverished. In this sense, a  language is the moral history of a nation.  The capacities of a great language to absorb abuse are very  large, but they are not unlimited. George Steiner has wondered  aloud whether German can ever recover from Nazification.4  What has Stalinism done to Russian, what does Maoism do to  Chinese? What did Vietnam do to us? George Orwell hypothesized that the radical destruction of language would involve a  19 	asu06600000270021001							67619784 Bytes	3931	5732	2673220063	RGB	8	600	asu06600000270021001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1294	1294	1295.jp2	/asu0660/image/1295.jp2
Poetry, Politics and Language					Zaller, Robert																											asu0660000027	progressive reduction in the number of words. But modern propaganda destroys language by stuffing it like a Strasbourg goose.  Torture becomes 'interrogation,' terror bombing is 'protective  reaction,' napalm 'soft ordnance' and cultural genocide 'resettlement, pacification, urbanization.' For prolonged and systematic  lying, the ordinary usages of language are too risky; words once  used to tell the truth may inadvertently do so again. To carry  out a 'surgical strike,' one needs a perfectly sterile instrument, a  language that means the lie and nothing else. This is what is  meant by a jargon, strictly speaking: it is a vocabulary of lies.  Jargon is linguistic cancer, a deliberately induced virulence  within the body of language. By comparison, the old-fashioned  techniques of censorship are pathetically crude. Censorship  takes away words, leaving behind a dangerous, unclaimed void;  jargon fills up the empty spaces, swallows the air. It is death by  edema, suffocation; the victim dies with foam on his lips.  The arts have combatted this with a desperate attempt to  re-establish space: not meaning or 'significant form,' but sheer,  simple space. In painting, it means a few daubs on an empty  canvas; in music, a few pings of isolated sound; in literature, a  language pared down to the point of silence. Confronted by the  Strasbourg goose, the artist makes the gesture of starvation.  This strategy has evident limits. Like the intellectual in  Simone de Beauvoir's The Mandarins who refers to the act of  making human beings into soap as 'the saponification of the  Jews,' the postwar artist fastidiously avoids mentioning  Auschwitz or Hiroshima, though for the opposite reason: lest he  evoke not the camps or the Bomb but the cliche they have  become. A. Alvarez tells how he once persuaded Sylvia Plath to  cut a reference to Hiroshima from one of her poems, and later  regretted it.5 Creating space may be a vital present task of the  arts, but it is not an end in itself. Sooner or later, an unfilled  space is merely a shell.  The escapism latent in what one may call, to borrow from  Jerome Rothenburg, "poems for the game of silence"6 has provoked many poets to the opposite extreme. They are 'committed' and 'political' with a vengeance: a vengeance that seems  most often directed at themselves. In their horror of possessing  privilege,  even the privilege of private thoughts and a private  20 	asu06600000270022001							67890660 Bytes	3944	5736	2527378888	RGB	8	600	asu06600000270022001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1295	1295	1296.jp2	/asu0660/image/1296.jp2
Poetry, Politics and Language					Zaller, Robert																											asu0660000027	personality, they cannot wait to abdicate everything to the  Cause. "A cripple goes by leading a child/" wrote Vallejo in the  Thirties;  After that, to read Andre Breton?  That is a very hard question. But then we progress to this  easy answer:  One thing I know:  there is no atom that is not  political,  and poetry can be quite  dangerous propaganda,  especially since all worthwhile  propaganda  ought to move its reader like  a poem.  Graffiti do that; so do some  songs,  and rarely poems on a page.  Rarely indeed. The poem fulfills the poet's apprehension: it  is inferior to graffiti.  The dilemma of social injustice is real: but the headlong  eagerness of many poets to do battle with it at the expense of  their art is more than a little suspect. Gottfried Benn's self-  depiction as "a wretched braindog laden down with God" might  serve to describe many others who placed themselves at the  service of one ideology or another; devotion to the misery of  others was a way of escaping one's own.  It is not my intention to judge men's motives; still less the  utility or futility of politics. I only say that the poet has been  called to a high and mysterious function in this time. It is a pity  for him and a deep misfortune for us all when he abandons it.  Poetry will never save us; it can give us no doctrine, no text for  a sermon; it offers at best, in the words of Montale, "provisional  conclusions," a truth forever insufficient, forever incomplete. I  do not say it is much; I say it is what we have. It defends us not  as a wall defends us but as a touchstone may. It is best defined  by what it lacks; it is a stubborn residuum; it is what resists the  21 	asu06600000270023001							67296192 Bytes	3917	5725	3420542159	RGB	8	600	asu06600000270023001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1296	1296	1297.jp2	/asu0660/image/1297.jp2

It is our prayer, and  the tiny maddening riddle we get in answer to it. That is certainly not enough for the angry hungers of this age. It is not even  enough, as we have seen, for many poets, who are also men. It  may not be enough to save language, the only instrument of our  grace. I did not say it was much. I said it was what we have.  Notes  1. From "New Song to Stalingrad" by Pablo Neruda, in Residence on  Earth and Other Poems, translated by Angel Flores (New Directions,  1946).  2.

Collecting Clues to Sherlock					Shaw, John Bennett																											asu0660000027	Collecting Clues to Sherlock  JOHN BENNETT SHAW  I admit to being an enthusiastic and dedicated book collector, but I prefer to use the term bibliophile. After all,  Thomas Jefferson was a book collector, hence The Library  of Congress; and Hans Sloane was a collector of books and  other evidences of culture and who has not heard of The British  Museum? And, what do I collect? Sherlock Holmes has become a major bibliophilic passion with me: for Holmes was  "The best and wisest man I have ever known": as Doctor Watson said for all of us.  At one time I collected a wide range of contemporary literature and I had in my home one wife, three children, two rats  (Romeo and Juliet), three dachshunds (Finnegan, Gogarty and  Bridget), a fair wine cellar and more than twenty-nine thousand  books. I concentrated on the works of some sixty important  modern authors and these I collected in depth. I also possessed  a comprehensive section of examples of nineteenth and twentieth-century "fine printing". Today I have retired from business, moved to another state, the rats have died after long and  interesting careers, only Bridget is alive but has been joined by  two other canines, only one child remains at home and the wine  cellar has turned over several times; oh yes, the wife remains.  And I have but six or seven thousand books remaining: the  others are at the libraries of my two universities, being used,  one hopes.  The major portion of my library now consists of some 390  linear feet of Holmesiana or Sherlockiana (the former if English  oriented the latter if American). One may well be stunned into  disbelief at this mass of material on one subject and ask how,  and why, and where. For, after all, the reputed author of these  famous tales published but nine books about the Great Detective.  Many, most, people believe that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle  wrote   four  novels   and  fifty-six   short   stories with Sherlock  23 	asu06600000270025001							67603316 Bytes	3928	5735	3740347223	RGB	8	600	asu06600000270025001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1298	1298	1299.jp2	/asu0660/image/1299.jp2
Collecting Clues to Sherlock					Shaw, John Bennett																											asu0660000027	Holmes as the dominant character. Sherlockians, by the way,  refer to these sixty narratives as the Canon. Perhaps those who  opt for Doyle as the author are correct, for he was a superb  storyteller and the published works do carry his name on the  title-pages, and he and his heirs did and do continue to reap  great wealth from the more than one hundred million copies  that have been sold in at least forty-five languages, and from the  film and stage rights, and so on. Yet there are several thousand  devoted and articulate reader-scholars who depose that from  internal evidence one must conclude that most of the stories  were penned by John H. Watson, M.D., that two were by  Holmes himself, one by his brother Mycroft and only one  clearly by Doyle; and that Arthur Conan Doyle was but the  literary agent. These same researchers can and do produce evidence that Holmes was born in Yorkshire in 1854, that he was  the world's first private consulting detective, that in 1903 he  retired to keep bees in Sussex, that he did emerge from retirement to assist his country in the 1914 war, that he is still alive  at age 121. On this last point they are firm, for no evidence of  any kind has been offered that he has died.  These Holmesian scholars are prolific and adulatory; they are  literate, clever, witty, and most fertile with theories that fast  become fact. The results are legion: my check-list never records  fewer than fifty books, pamphlets and Holmesian society publications a year, and for the same period more than seventy-five  periodical entries. Further, journals whose contents are entirely  devoted to the explication of the Holmes Canon are issued in  the United States, Great Britain, Denmark and Sweden. Research often appears in books and magazines in Japan, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Canada and elsewhere. Especially prolific  were the Sherlockian contributions published last year. With  eleven new books, many pamphlets and pieces of ephemera,  several television productions, the excellent performance of the  Gillette play Sherlock Holmes done in Washington and New  York by The Royal Shakespeare Company, several other play  performances and, at the year's end, the publication of The  World Bibliography of Sherlock Holmes, compiled by Ronald  De Waal, truly make 1974 the Year of the Sherlock. Amazing!  Rather than confuse with such staggering generalities, let me  24 	asu06600000270026001							68079948 Bytes	3964	5723	3920996939	RGB	8	600	asu06600000270026001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1299	1299	1300.jp2	/asu0660/image/1300.jp2
Collecting Clues to Sherlock					Shaw, John Bennett																											asu0660000027	break down the scope of a proper Sherlockian collection into  nine categories.  Firstly, the basic Sherlock Holmes: this would contain the  Canon—the nine books. But not just nine books: one should  have these nine in first edition (I have eight) and one should  possess all important editions of each that differ, i.e. in illustrations, revisions, special introductions, and so on. For example, a  check-list just of printings of The Sign of the Four was published, listing more than one hundred different collectable editions and these only in English. In addition, the compiler completed a list of several dozen more.  Next, one should consider translations of the Canon into  languages other than English: in my library I have at least some  of the stories in twenty-nine languages, including such unusual  volumes as The Hound of the Baskervilles in Gaelic and a Swa-  hili version of Holmes. Further, I have the Canon in Braille and  in both Gregg and Pitman shorthand.  The third category would include parodies and pastiches.  More of these have been published than there are stories in the  Canon. In the published tales Holmes and/or Watson mention in  passing more than one hundred and ten other tales, cases not  recorded but noted by name or by allusion. Most of these have  since been written by others. I own either in book or pamphlet  or periodical form some five hundred of these efforts.  Another area of interest would be the Writings about the  Writings, that is, scholarship and conjecture: biographical, chronological, instructional, explicational and so on. I have more  than three hundred books and pamphlets and at least five hundred periodicals dealing with this aspect of the problem. These  run the gamut of imaginative and painstaking research: such as  four chronologies, several biographies (and these not only of  Holmes but of Watson and even one of Moriarty), bibliographies  (even one on the writings of Holmes himself with facsimile  reproductions of various title pages), Holmes' will, his prayer,  his coat of arms, et cetera. This section contains such flights of  fancy as the very rare first printing of Rex Stout's notorious  "Watson Was a Woman" and Dr. Zeisler's paper attempting to  prove that Holmes' mercurial temperament was caused by  faulty elimination. There are also articles on Holmes' bank ac-  25 	asu06600000270027001							67305340 Bytes	3910	5736	2172160919	RGB	8	600	asu06600000270027001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1300	1300	1301.jp2	/asu0660/image/1301.jp2

There is included even a "gay" Sherlock  Holmes!  The next collectable area would include the avalanche of  material that has been issued by the many societies devoted to  "keeping green the memory of the Master Detective". In 1934  The Baker Street Irregulars in New York and The Sherlock  Holmes Society of London were founded. These two societies  continue to flourish and I am a proud member of both. Furthermore, especially in the United States, there exist some sixty  active Scion Societies such as The Speckled Band of Boston,  The Six Napoleons of Baltimore, The Hounds of the Baskerville  (sic) of Chicago, The Maiwand Jezails of Omaha, The Scowrers  and The Molly Maguires of San Francisco, The Arkansas Valley  Investors of Little Rock, Dr. Watson's Neglected Patients of  Denver, The Brothers Three of Moriarty of Santa Fe and Mori-  arty (yes, Moriarty!), New Mexico and The Sons of the Copper  Beeches of Philadelphia. There are active societies in Canada,  Denmark, Sweden, Japan, and other places. There are professional Scion Societies in the library world and a special one for  dermatologists. Each of these issues annually (or more frequently) printed menus, programs, quizzes to confound the experts, printed or duplicated speeches, toasts, minutes, bibliographies, pictures and the like. All should be preserved for posterity and this I am attempting to do. I suppose that one should  include in this category the periodicals published by the various  societies; these would now total more than three hundred different issues coming from five nations, and I believe I have them  all!  The next collectable area appears endless: Holmes on stage  and screen, radio and television. Mr. Holmes has been depicted  in some one hundred thirty motion pictures, many more than  26 	asu06600000270028001							67273288 Bytes	3902	5745	2290869	RGB	8	600	asu06600000270028001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1301	1301	1302.jp2	/asu0660/image/1302.jp2
Collecting Clues to Sherlock					Shaw, John Bennett																											asu0660000027	five hundred radio shows, at least seventy television versions  have been aired, and at least twenty-five plays dramatized. In  addition, a ballet, a musical, and several puppet shows have  been produced, all devoted to the adventures of the Great Detective. One Baker Street Scion, The Priory Scholars of Forham  specialize in this area of dramatization. Music would be included, and I have either in sheet music or on records or tapes,  songs that date back to 1891 celebrating our hero. There exists  also a fine compilation entitled A Baker Street Song Book.  Next would be a section dealing with the artist's concept of  Holmes and his friends and enemies. There have been published  three comprehensive iconographies that evaluate the work of  more than one hundred artists who have tried to visualize or  interpret the events recounted in these masterpieces and their  striking protagonist.  Another collection could be made of the Canon as designed  for the younger reader or the student. This includes more than  twenty-five simplified versions of the Canon and many comic  strips, film strips, and readings on tape or disc.  Lastly, an entire and most impressive collection could be  made (in fact should be made if one were to have a rounded  Holmesian library) to include statues and other objects of art,  puzzles, games (both card and board), cigarette cards (English),  book matches, deerstalker hats, tobacco and Holmes cigars, the  London Society tie, the use of the Holmes theme in advertis-  ments, phonograph records (including several that report on  Scion meetings), beer coasters and menus from the six or seven  Holmesian pubs, and so on and so on.  Yes, it is an endless task, and completion is impossible. Remember the often-quoted statement from Christopher Morley,  the Great Founding Father of our cult, "never has so much  been written by so many for so few." What a challenge to a  bibliophile! One must be a serious researcher, possess a sense of  humor, have time and, alas, money. Just ponder the confusion  and amazement a collection such as mine will cause when researched in the year 2500. And what an open door to reading,  fun, companionship this world of Sherlock Holmes offers! Give  me a call.  27 	asu06600000270029001							67567488 Bytes	3915	5751	3326796442	RGB	8	600	asu06600000270029001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1302	1302	1303.jp2	/asu0660/image/1303.jp2

Juana Borrero: Portrait of a Poetess					Núñez, Ana Rosa																											asu0660000028	Juana Borrero: Portrait of a Poetess  ANA ROSA NUNEZ  Translated and edited by  Graciella Cruz Taura  Having just received a copy of Eugenio Florit's last  poetry collection, entitled De tiempo y agonia (Of  Time and Agony), it occurred to me that the title  pould easily be applied to this portrait of Juana Borrero, for  Juana's young life was one of waiting and agony, an agony  so long that it may be more precisely described as a time of  agony.  As we now approach the centennial of her birth in 1877,  we notice that time has continued to be an agony in itself.  Agony is the time to recapitulate, to meditate, and to reach  conclusions that are not and never will be new conclusions  for those of us who believe in transcendental values, for  those of us who know that beyond the flesh there exists the  soul, and that beyond the soul one finds the raison d'etre.  Accordingly I wish to value those profound moments that  allow us in the times in which we live, to find an oasis within  our agony.  The poetess Juana Borrero arose out of the ashes left by  a fire that if rekindled can throw light on the present time.  It is appropriate to introduce Juana to the youth of today,  since she is an outstanding example of a young person who  was sacrificed in the obstinate quest for liberty that has  characterized the Cuban nationality. It is important to discuss  Juana Borrero because she continues to be an exile among  the exiles of the twentieth century. She is still an exile because  her grave is not in her homeland, for she died in Key West, 	asu06600000280003001							66555132 Bytes	3857	5750	2503475561	RGB	8	600	asu06600000280003001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1313	1313	1314.jp2	/asu0660/image/1314.jp2
Juana Borrero: Portrait of a Poetess					Núñez, Ana Rosa																											asu0660000028	where she was buried in a tomb belonging to friends of her  family. The gravesite was not identified until two years ago.  Two outstanding Cubans, Jose Maria Bens Arrarte, custodian  of Cuba's National Monuments, and the novelist and journalist  Octavio de la Suaree, the latter a close and sincere friend of  the Borrero family, have joined the Cuban Society of Archeology and Ethnology in Exile in an effort to find the poetess'  remains, in order to erect an appropriate memorial, worthy  of the dignity that characterized her life. The report of the  Cuban Society of Archeology and Ethnology in Exile reads  as follows:  In the City of Key West, Florida, on November 26, 1972,  the undersigned met for the exhumation of the remains of  Miss Juana Borrero Pierra, a Cuban poetess, painter, and  patriot.  Preliminaries: (1) According to a copy of the death  registry of the Bureau of Vital Statistics of Jacksonville,  (dated October 3, 1972), the aforementioned died on March  10, 1896, at age eighteen, white, single; the death was certified to have been caused by typhoid fever ... (3) According  to information provided by Juana's sister, Mrs. Mercedes  Borrero y Pierra, to Mr. Octavio de la Suaree, the body was  buried in a grave offered by the Cordero family, specifically  that of Aurelio Cordero . . .  Preliminary exploration: Having obtained permission from  the City Manager and the assistance of the cemetery's guard,  Mr. Jack Carbonal, we decided to begin the preliminary  exploration to prove the authenticity of any remains that we  might find . . .  Characteristics of the skull: A brachycephalic skull was  found with the temporal and malar bones loosed, the altered  sutures and the alveolae almost destroyed. This skull belongs  to a female approximately eighteen years old. Considering the  established preliminaries, it may be deduced that this skull  belongs to the person whose remains we wish to preserve and  to honor.  Exhumation: On Sunday, November 26, 1972, at noon,  (under a constant drizzle), we proceeded to the total exhumation . . . (the remains) were placed in a wooden box with a  top and covered with a Cuban flag; they were taken to the  mausoleum at the Order "Caballeros de la Luz". (signed)  Jose M.

Juana Borrero: Portrait of a Poetess					Núñez, Ana Rosa																											asu0660000028	What is of most interest to us is the fact that Juana  Borrero has now her own resting place at the cemetery in  Key West. That little island was to the first Cuban migration  of the nineteenth century what Miami represents to the Cuban  of today, if one disregards Tampa and New York. In that  cemetery, next to the tamarind trees that provide shade for  many Cuban graves Jose Marti once defined the Cuban  character:  . . . what is the Cuban soul? There is in a corner of Florida  that was no more than a hamlet to the North Americans but  has become a town in Cuban hands, a good, old lady from the  best part of Las Villas, that lost her family and home in the  war. She still retains the height of the good times of the past,  as revealed by her clean room with white walls and a flower  vase, as in the comfortable times of the past. On cold mornings, together with the first artisans that leave for work, the  old lady, Carolina, wrapped in her shawl, walks to her factory,  goes up the entrance steps, and sits down as if to provide  shade for her work table. And when she receives the week's  salary, which is a sad amount because her seventy-year-old  hands can do little work, she puts some dollars in an envelope  to be sent to a Cuban that is sick at the Ceuta prison. In  another envelope she puts money for a prisoner kept at a  Cuban jail for political reasons and two other dollars she  sends to the Club Cubanacan because she considers the club's  president an honest man and because Cubanacan was the  name she used during the war. With the eyes of a sentinel  and with motherly love, this seventy-year-old Cuban keeps a  vigil for freedom! She knows the enemy, she knows where to  find any suffering Cubans and she works for them, as on the  cold morning when she wrapped herself in a wool shawl. This  is the soul of Cuba.  (Patria, 30 April, 1892)  Four years after Jose Marti discovered the Cuban soul  through Carolina Rodriguez, the soul of Cuba arrived in Key  West in the eighteen-year-old Juana Borrero.  Out of this environment inhabited by cigar rollers some  of Cuba's most significant historical events emerged. Biscayne  Bay, which guards the city of Miami, is in many ways the  counterpart of the Key West that received the Cuban exiles  of the nineteenth century. Just as France was celebrating  the centennial  of  the  French  Revolution  by  erecting  the 	asu06600000280005001							66589804 Bytes	3863	5744	2153440840	RGB	8	600	asu06600000280005001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1315	1315	1316.jp2	/asu0660/image/1316.jp2
Juana Borrero: Portrait of a Poetess					Núñez, Ana Rosa																											asu0660000028	Eiffel Tower, the Cuban people were dying for the ideal of  freedom that the revolution had propagated. In the midst of  the last moments of romanticism and the decadence of modernism, the literary giants from our Hispanic-American world  (Marti, Julian del Casal, Ruben Dario, Gutierrez Najera,  among others)  noticed Juana Borrero.  I have begun by presenting a Juana Borrero who was  dead, lost, and later rescued from the sands of Key West. I  shall end by presenting a living Juana Borrero, who under  similar circumstances could be any one of us.  A great deal of Cuban literature has been written in  Europe or in continental America. Exile and distance have  moulded the creativity of our great writers. This theory is  best exemplified by Jose Maria Heredia and Jose Marti. These  two men, creators of literary schools representing two different aesthetics, saw their works translated into many languages  and particularly into English.  The attention devoted to Heredia by William Cullen Bryant  and the creative mutuality of Walt Whitman and Marti establish an affinity with a great part of Cuba's best literature.  It is an expatriate literature intensively charged with melancholy, cogitation, sorrow, and strife. Perhaps distance from  one's homeland and the absence of freedom provide the man  of genius with a more profound sensibility and creative spirit.  Polly Harrison, in a recently published article, refuses to  acknowledge the presence of cubanidad (Cuban-ness) and of  a Creole spirit in the poetry of Juana Borrero. I shall proceed  to demonstrate that the aforementioned critic is incorrect in  her assertion that Juana Borrero lacks the cubanidad and  Creole spirit that is noticeable in contemporary Cuban exiled  poets, for Juana Borrero was indeed a very duty conscious  citizen who wrote sensitive patriotic poems.  She is not only the Juana Borrero described by Jose Maria  Chacon y Calvo as "of light spirit, whose life was a marvel  of emotion; the style of her lyrics not very modern but rather  intimate, full of emotions and images that became progressively more intrinsic. A poetess of sincere melancholy  L 	asu06600000280006001							68607460 Bytes	3956	5779	1063666621	RGB	8	600	asu06600000280006001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1316	1316	1317.jp2	/asu0660/image/1317.jp2
Juana Borrero: Portrait of a Poetess					Núñez, Ana Rosa																											asu0660000028	for whom melancholy was beyond words and for whom poetry  was only the prologue to intimation."  Juana Borrero is more than the description by Rafael  Estenger, "intuitive, with a premature poetic talent, who  manifested herself as a spirit of exacerbated sensitivity  influenced personally and aesthetically by Julian del Casal,  while leaving in her lyrics the presence of Gustavo Adolfo  Becquer." Juana shall not be for us the intimate being that  her sister tells us about nor the lonely and tormented poetess  who is softly felt in "La ultima rima" (The Last Rhyme),  possibly her only well-known poem.  Ours is a Juana Borrero full of civic and patriotic spirit.  In spite of her youth, she was very much concerned with the  political convulsions affecting Cuba at that time. She felt  the indifference and the incomprehensibility faced by all the  exiles of 1896 who, like her, were willing to sacrifice themselves for the sake of Cuba's freedom.  II  There are many roads along which one may pass in exile.  A Cuban is forced into exile every time his love of liberty  and his vocation to be free and respected are challenged. Exile  is a journey that commences in one's conscience and ends  sometimes in eternity, sometimes along a thorny road where  not even a resting place is to be found.  Exile possesses its own mystique that awakens thoughts  that had been necessarily put away. At times, the exile's  nights are glazed by thoughts of the fate of his mortal  remains. To wonder about which land will keep one's body  seems to reduce the fear produced by insecurity and the  distance from the homeland. If life makes demands, so does  death. Yet the soul of the exile has an interior horizon with  its own sky and seas that provide a home for one's torments.  "My time runs short, I need eternity" is the phrase that  summarizes  the   life  of   Juana   Borrero.   It  could   well   be 	asu06600000280007001							66930608 Bytes	3872	5760	679805822	RGB	8	600	asu06600000280007001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1317	1317	1318.jp2	/asu0660/image/1318.jp2
Juana Borrero: Portrait of a Poetess					Núñez, Ana Rosa																											asu0660000028	engraved on the small coffer that holds her recently found  remains at the Key West cemetery.  The exile of Juana Borrero has been long and shall continue. Until the day when Juana's remains can rest in Cuban  soil, she shall still be an exile, although she no longer finds  time too short, and immortality is open to her.  Juana Borrero joined the Cuban parnassus with only one  book, Rimas (Habana: Biblioteca de Gris y Azul, 1895).  Although she died at the age of eighteen, she knew affliction  and grief much earlier. Her poem "Todavia" (Not Yet!, 1890)  part of the collection Grupo de Familia leads her to the question "Why so soon, oh world, did you offer me your sour  and lethal poison?" Making reference to this poem in 1892,  she wrote to Carlos Pio Uhrbach, her fiance: "You should  know that my childhood was brief. I wrote that poem when  I was not even fourteen years old, when I had already experienced sorrows."  Forced to leave Cuba in 1895, she learned the true meaning  of that interior horizon described by her in the poem "El  ideal," because in exile her ideal became the return to her  birthplace:  Cuando a veces me postra el desaliento  0 la nostalgia ardiente del pasado,  El me ilumina un porvenir glorioso  Con el fulgor benefico de un astro.  Donde quiera me lleve he de seguirle  Y aunque deba morir en suelo extrafio  Yo cruzare tras el siempre serena  La inmensidad grandiosa del Oceano.  jOh patria! Si la muerte inexorable  No me detiene con su helada mano  En mitad de la senda peligrosa  A donde en pos de mi ideal me lanzo.  Tu recuerdo que siempre ira conmigo  Me dara nuevo ardor ante el obstaculo.  jYo salvare mi nombre del olvido!  jYo luchare por conquistarte un lauro!

Juana Borrero: Portrait of a Poetess					Núñez, Ana Rosa																											asu0660000028	This poem, written three years before she died, foreboded  the tragedy that befell the Borrero family. The Borreros  were spiritually an aristocratic family of high-spirited ancestors, courageous and filled with an unconquerable love of  freedom. Juana's Cuban soul inherited these ideals of independence and freedom. When still a child, she conspired  against the Spanish colonial authorities. Using as an excuse  a doctor's recommendation that Juana should seek a different  climate to improve her health, the Borreros speedily planned  a trip that was essentially a political escape. Following their  departure, their house in Puentes Grandes, which had hosted  so many Cuban intellectual luminaries during the tertulias  offered by Juana's father, Don Esteban Borrero y Echevarria,  was totally destroyed by the Spaniards. Most of Juana's  work was lost in this vindictive pillage. More than a destruction of books, paintings, manuscripts, it was a destruction of  the spirit.  Juana Borrero carried within her soul a picture of Cuba  that was a sensitive, profound and refined sketch of her  tropical homeland; it was to be one of the finest pages written  by this poetess, revealing her sincerity and sensibility.  Juana did not write to please literary critics, and if we  choose to approach her, we should do so respectfully, keeping  in mind her wish to be considered in terms of her feelings,  and not by scathing criticism. She wrote for herself, for the  most part, and this probably makes her writing all the better.  Cuba was Juana's great concern. Although she has not  been considered generally a poet of the tropics, in her poetry  one finds an exquisite, refined and genuine tropic radiance,  soothed by Caribbean breezes, a tropic reminiscent of the  Cuban landscapes painted by Winslow Homer. Juana's tropic  land is not one of intense colors and sensual rhythms but  of soft breezes and a pure firmament.  Before leaving her country, Juana described Cuba with  bucolic tones that almost resemble Juan Ramon Jimenez. Such  an impression of Cuba can be noticed in this poem:  IA donde van mis locos sueiios?  ^Mis ilusiones, do me llevan? 	asu06600000280009001							67287228 Bytes	3894	5758	4136486661	RGB	8	600	asu06600000280009001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1319	1319	1320.jp2	/asu0660/image/1320.jp2
Juana Borrero: Portrait of a Poetess					Núñez, Ana Rosa																											asu0660000028	Hacia el pais de las delicias,  Donde se olvidan las tristezas.  Donde es el cielo siempre puro,  Donde las horas de la siesta  Se oye el rumor de blandas olas  Al expirar sobre la arena.  Donde se siente la esperanza  Llenar de luz el alma enferma.  Y los espectros de la duda  Raudos huir de la conciencia.  This was Juana Borrero's Cuba, a place of many delights,  where all grief could be forgotten, where the skies were  always clear, and where hope could enlighten a sick soul.  Nothing can be more beautiful than the lyrical relationship  between Juana and her country. One cannot help but deplore  the barbarism that led to the destruction of her home.  From her childhood days Juana Borrero was an intense,  lucid, and passionate poetess. At age five she was painting  and writing, as exemplified by a drawing of a carnation and  a rose that she named "Romeo and Juliet." With primitive  symbolism, Juana painted human emotions; thus in paintings  that lacked rule but not style, she personified envy, disobedience, paternal love, sacrifice, and other virtues and vices  that affect the human spirit.  We know of Juana's childhood from the testimonies given  by her sisters Dulce Maria and Mercedes. They tell us that  the following poem describing her feelings at sunset was  written at age seven:  Por la tarde, en los sitios misteriosos  cuando cesa la alondra de eantar  y Vespero se oculta tembloroso  en el seno del mar;  cuando agoniza el sol revererante  y extiende por el cielo su arrebol,  sobre mi frente pensativa siento  bajar la inspiracion.  Juana was well acquainted with the works of Leopardi,  Hugo, Musset, Dante and Milton, but her favorite poets were  Becquer  and  Heine.   Dulce  Maria  Borrero  remembers  her  8  L 	asu06600000280010001							67010896 Bytes	3876	5761	4223747834	RGB	8	600	asu06600000280010001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1320	1320	1321.jp2	/asu0660/image/1321.jp2
Juana Borrero: Portrait of a Poetess					Núñez, Ana Rosa																											asu0660000028	sister "at midday, under the haze of the winter sun, during  the Christmas season, stopping by the neighboring brambled  forest to take a deep breath of that perfumed air while  carrying poinsettias, and instead of finding everything in life  vain, she returned to the house through the old pathway, with  a radiant face, her want of breath not keeping her from  entoning a guajiro (peasant) dirge, that her mother had  taught her when she was only a small child." Dulce Maria  remembers her sister walking through the woods as if she  had been part of nature, in spite of her saddened heart.  Juana Borrero was also described by Julian del Casal,  her literary master and aesthetic idol. Though he saw her as  a sister, an unspecified incident had marred their friendship.  Upon the unexpected death of this great poet, considered by  many the first modernist on our continent, a tormented Juana  wrote:  On that day I was the cause of a great person's grief. He  reproached me harshly and my promises did not suffice to dissipate his resentment. I carried that thorn in my soul for  more than ten months, and I nurtured my heart with the hope  of seeing him again. But implacable destiny punished me; he  died before my dearest wish, that of seeing him once more,  could come true.  In one of the poems that Julian del Casal dedicated to  Juana, he expressed his fraternal love for her and tells of his  presentiments about her early death in the concluding stanza:  Ah! yo siempre te adoro como un hermana,  No solo porque todo lo juzgas vano  Y la expresion celeste de tu belleza,  Sino porque en ti veo ya la tristeza  De los seres que deben morir temprano.  Julian del Casal always saw Juana as a sad person. He  explained her premature melancholy in terms upon which  one must meditate:  The melancholy that stems from the early works of certain  artists is the fermentation of those sorrows caused by the  daily experience of seeing the shortcomings that life offers  to their aspirations. It is not an imaginary grief, as some  contend, but a real and premature disgust, an intense depression, a cold skepticism, a blurring of the senses, an uncon-  9 	asu06600000280011001							66755420 Bytes	3876	5739	1770326646	RGB	8	600	asu06600000280011001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1321	1321	1322.jp2	/asu0660/image/1322.jp2

Although Casal was Juana's literary model, there are  some basic differences between the two. Juana humanized  the fable and Julian del Casal mythified reality. His spirit  was characterized by hyperesthesia; in his artistic creations  reality and myth were one. Juana was an intense soul who  interpreted natural beauty.  Still another impression of Juana has been given to us by  Carlos Pio Uhrbach, a well-known poet and follower of Julian  del Casal. He was Juana's fiance, as clearly proved by her  Epistolario, first published in Havana in 1966. They met while  in exile, but he had dedicated a sonnet to her in the collection  Gemelas (Twins), which he had co-authored with his brother  Federico and had dedicated to Julian del Casal. Juana was  impressed by the sonnet, and she began to fall in love with  him from the moment she read it. Carlos was also a sensitive  and patriotic person, and when Juana died, he wrote a moving  description of how he remembered her:  Exactly a year ago I met Juana Borrero. In desolation I ask  myself today what for. When we met each of us was full of  nostalgia, grief, and dreams. Our dreams were part of a  selfdestructive patrimony that life gave us because they were  in perpetual disagreement with reality and they were too  sublime to attempt an adaptation.  It is not proper for me to expose the intimacy of the great  soul that has just left us. She is a sanctuary inaccessible to  those of us that were unable to fulfill the hopes of her spirit.  But I will talk about how she was, about what she could have  been, how easy it could have been for her to go far in life,  because she possessed powerful wings that would have let her  reach the summit of art, because she was not meant to live  in the miasmata of this world. Her thirst was for ideality!  Those who have considered Juana as a strongly marked temperament are mistaken. She was not tropical at all; only her  features could reveal that she was born in the tropics.

The Sun is my worst enemy" and with luxurious images she  would allow my mind to see septentrional panoramas, landscapes of snow, castles surrounded by pine trees, crepuscular  distances, frozen lakes, towns full of silver firs . . . Aware  of this extravagant anxiety, I would listen to her, hypnotized  by the fascinating magic of her language! Now her words  seem very distant. Their echo will always be in my heart, but  never again will my ears hear them!  Juana Borrero had the presentiment of her premature death.  Death horrified her, and yet she loved it. This apparent contradiction was a fact. On melancholic moonlight nights, when  the stars' cold light charms nature, she would recite the  immortal lyrics dedicated to her by the unhappy Casal and  when she read the last verse — where her early death was  prophesied — her voice lowered, the soft sounds disappearing  as musical notes in a temple's penumbra while her head  nodded as if she knew that her death was approaching. I  repeat that I want everyone to know how much she was  worth. I want to feel the pleasure of enumerating her exceptional abilities because my infinite sorrow cannot wound my  heart anymore as I remember her. Her memory is a legacy  that my heart is not honorable enough to keep in spite of the  misfortunes and the memories that it guards. After Casal  died, no one in Cuba possessed a temperament so artistic,  such precise intuition, such delicate inspiration as Juana. The  renown that she obtained following the publication of Rimas  demonstrates this. She reserved her lyric to color elevated  topics and to chisel verses because her literary banner was  "art for art's sake." Her scorn for the ordinary was as great  as her talent! . . .  ... In her fantasy she conceived who knows how many projects! They were all beautiful, elevated, sublime. She once told  me about a curious book she was preparing, to be entitled  En la dicha (While in Happiness), for which I was to write  the prologue, she the verses, and both of us the epilogue . . .  Her radiant face and smiling lips led me to imagine an  aureole about her head; a halo should have encircled her  elated head, a head that I will never see again. Painting  laureated her. Each of her paintings was a success; every  detail was a sign of inspiration. I am not that erudite. I  cannot judge her. But Casal did express her worth. I have  only been able to love her just as now I will only know how  to remember her while I weep . . .  By a strange coincidence, we both preferred the same artists.  Cristian Chalon and the great Botticelli enchanted her! Once  15 	asu06600000280017001							66204712 Bytes	3844	5739	3983011661	RGB	8	600	asu06600000280017001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1327	1327	1328.jp2	/asu0660/image/1328.jp2
Juana Borrero: Portrait of a Poetess					Núñez, Ana Rosa																											asu0660000028	when she described to me Destiny by the Italian symbolist,  the expression in her face brightened and her sensations were  translated in such a way that her thoughts left me shivering.  In what seemed an attempt to cover the entire suggestive  painting, the pupils of her eyes expanded phosphorescently  as they felt the indestructible power of memories . . . and I  was deeply impressed, pale, eager, as if I myself had the  painting in front of my eyes and as if I had borrowed her  great sensitivity to appreciate subtleties . . . She began to  grow calm, her face returning to its usual intelligent expression, as if the tempest that had just passed through her soul  and reached beauty was unable to alter her spirit! What  else? ... I do not know! I do not know! I do not want to  know. What for? Does it matter to anyone else? Those that  loved her, those that knew who she was, those who have seen  the interior of my soul, they will understand that the departure of this virgin has meant the total eclipse of my  dreams . . .  As I carelessly write these words without polish, since I have  no vanity when I write of her, I sense the vertigo produced  by a fall from a precipice and I feel that my soul opens to  receive the embalmed flower of religious faith. I do not know  if this flower is white or black because the darkness in my  spirit prevents me from noticing the corolla's color . . .  This is a gray and cold morning, yet it seems to me that it is  warm and radiant, because winter resides in my heart and  night in my soul!  (12 March 1896)  After these varied impressions of Juana, we add some  comments made by Ruben Dario when he heard of Juana  Borrero's death:  While armed men full of hate bring destruction to the island  of Cuba during a cruel war now being fought there, an  uncommon girl, a sweet and uncommon girl, makes her  entrance into the world of darkness, in the midst of the  sadness that her compatriots feel; and it seems as if she  turns her face to bid farewell, and the motion of her hand is  an enigmatic gesture heralding hopes for a better moment yet  to come. She is as a white vision, in a mysterious ancient  castle, disappearing behind a door in the darkness of a silent  empire, in time immemorial.  Cuba has been a dear and glorious island, for developing  Latin American  thought, because  following the birth there  16  L 	asu06600000280018001							66475372 Bytes	3878	5712	1474115502	RGB	8	600	asu06600000280018001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1328	1328	1329.jp2	/asu0660/image/1329.jp2

Dario concludes:  She wrote admirable sonnets, in the Casal tradition, full of a  mystical and very strange sensualism, where we may find the  influence of the poet who wrote Nieve, so praised by his  teacher Verlaine and by the eminent Huysmans. Poor and  adorable dreamer who no longer belongs in this world!  Flowers for a flower! The words that lamented Ophelia's  death sound very appropriate for her! I salute this virgin  that now ascends to a balcony in Paradise, as did Rossetti's  lover and Poe's Rowena but this time my grief is deeper  because such a special being has left before knowing the  divine and terrible secret of love.  (Buenos Aires: La Nacion, 23  May 1896)  Thus was Juana Borrero seen by the great poets Julian  del Casal, Carlos Uhrbach, and Ruben Dario, and by her sister  Dulce Maria.  Ill  People have often asked if Juana met Jose Marti. According to her sisters they did meet, but this has been questioned  by some because there is no written evidence. This may be  due to the conspiracy in which Esteban Borrero participated;  Marti may have considered it inappropriate to mention their  acquaintance. Her sister Mercedes, whom I met during the  lecture series on Juana offered by Havana's Lyceum Lawn  Tennis Club in 1962, showed me the then unpublished letters  that Juana had written to Carlos Pio Uhrbach, which Mercedes kept in a small wooden box, probably as small as the  one that today contains Juana's remains. Mercedes told me  that Marti and Juana had known each other. She informed  me of the occasion in which Juana read her famous poem  "Esperad" to Marti, describing the incident as follows:  17 	asu06600000280019001							66572252 Bytes	3862	5744	4207131545	RGB	8	600	asu06600000280019001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1329	1329	1330.jp2	/asu0660/image/1330.jp2
Juana Borrero: Portrait of a Poetess					Núñez, Ana Rosa																											asu0660000028	In the spring of 1892 Esteban Borrero received a letter from  Benjamin Guerra, Gonzalo de Quesada, and Manuel Barranco,  members of the Cuban Revolutionary Junta in New York,  that led to Borrero's decision to leave Cuba. Varona, Sanguily,  Villanova and Don Gabriel del Castillo visit the big house on  the river often and at night. The family gathering lasts until  very late. The preparations have been taken care of. The  mother checks the clothespress; she watches Juana's health,  since it has been decided that Juana should travel with her  father. Juana's painting lessons serve to disguise the true  motive for the trip. On the day of their departure, the father  wears a Prince Albert coat, elegant and black, as those that  wrap a coffin. A satin bow, resembling a butterfly holds the  girl's braided hair; she wears a feather hat and a short skirt.  Marti has organized a welcoming reception so that she may  be introduced to the Cubans in New York. Juana read her  patriotic poem "Esperad". The father presents Marti with  some of Juana's paintings.  According to Mercedes Borrero, Marti possessed a water-  color based on a landscape drawing by Juana; the same one  that had inspired Julian del Casal to a sketch in Bustos y  rimas  (Medallions and Rhymes).  The poem that Juana read in New York was a patriotic  testimony that every Cuban should remember. It was written  on the occasion of the death of Diego Vicente Tejera and  embodies the spirit of Cubans of that generation concerning  Cuba's freedom. The poem reads as follows:  Descansan en el seno de la patria  Que con valor heroico defendieron  Oponiendo los pechos generosos  Del enemigo al sanguinario acero!  Quizas nos  culpan de mirar pasivos  La agonizante convulsion de un pueblo,  Que pugna en vano por romper el yugo  Que lo mantiene, a su pesar, sujeto!  Quizas jbaldon mortal! nos juzgan complices  Del tirano, vencidos por el miedo,  Y al espurio de la martir Cuba  Fulminan ya,  terrible su  desprecio!  Nuestros hermanos los que sufren vivos,  £Por siempre jay! siempre gemiran abyectos?  ^Sera para el pais que defendisteis  Esteril jay! el sacrificio vuestro? . . .  18  i 	asu06600000280020001							67492792 Bytes	3910	5752	3773275440	RGB	8	600	asu06600000280020001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1330	1330	1331.jp2	/asu0660/image/1331.jp2
Juana Borrero: Portrait of a Poetess					Núñez, Ana Rosa																											asu0660000028	iNo es posible! jEsperad! j quizas no tarde  De la batalla entre el confuso estruendo  De iLibertad! el anhelado grito  En conmover vuestros sagrados restos!  This is Juana Borrero's sad credo, the symbol of a young  person who has suffered and has identified herself with the  terrible fate affecting her compatriots. Juana Borrero is  the symbol of sacrificed youth, of sacrificed love, of frustrated  hopes. She died in a strange land, as her fears had foretold,  and she died young, as Julian del Casal had told her. Her  dreams never came true; she did not marry Carlos Pio Uhrbach, for he had left for the Cuban battlefields, where he died,  after seeing Juana one last time in Key West, where she lay  dying of typhoid fever.  Perhaps on that cold January afternoon as Juana, the "girl  muse," was dying, she recalled more intensively than ever  before those famous lines, "Los proscriptos" (The Exiles),  which she had written upon her arrival in Key West. It is a  chapter in the history of Cuba's quest for independence that  still has relevance today, particularly for those of us who  have suffered for the sake of this quest. What Juana felt in  Key West when she remembered the night she left Cuba has  immortalized her. Even those who left Cuba too young to  remember it should understand what it meant to their parents,  as it did to Juana, to leave their beloved homeland. It meant  sacrifice, renunciation of one's spiritual and material values,  and seeing one's country lost and ignored in the midst of the  free nations of the world. Juana's words are dedicated to  those who love, understand, and defend proscribed ideals.  When the distant shadows evanesced within the horizon, the  beloved homeland disappeared behind the horizon. Night  advanced over the calm sea and its darkness also reached the  human souls while its cold fog lent sadness to those absent  from their country. From the round-house and under the  infinite sky full of quivering stars, I stood staring at that  line where sea and sky meet. Nostalgia filled my heart while  tears filled my eyes, as I thought of my beloved land which  remained behind me in the shadows. To bid farewell to one's  home, to one's dearest loved ones, to the suffering homeland,  is certainly very sad. The intimate rupture within our heart  19 	asu06600000280021001							66571900 Bytes	3828	5795	38058441	RGB	8	600	asu06600000280021001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1331	1331	1332.jp2	/asu0660/image/1332.jp2
Juana Borrero: Portrait of a Poetess					Núñez, Ana Rosa																											asu0660000028	I  hurts more because we cannot forgive ourselves for this  unwilled expatriation; we feel ungrateful abandoning the  distressed country.  Facing us is the unknown, a strange land, a shadow, the sad  night of the proscribed nostalgia. Behind us is the land we  adore, where we learned to worship an ideal of glorious  redemption, and where we leave friends who love us and  brothers who fight for liberty.  The uncertainty of an unforseeable future and the desolate  realization that the past must be definitely buried cause the  exile's soul to succumb as it is tormented by sorrows and  dreams that like the stars no longer give light.  Between two infinite sorrows, between the abysses of darkness, between two dark horizons, one travels ominously to the  unknown and strange region. One must leave behind ideals,  sweet dreams now dead, aspirations to happiness. The horizon  in front of us brings tears and our souls receive the frost  of an annihilating nostalgia.

Saul Bellow as Professor					Emery, Jane, 1917-																											asu0660000039	Jane Emery  Saul Bellow as Professor  There is in Bellow a kind of little professor who  keeps fluttering around the characters . . .  John Updike1  In 1983 Professor Saul Bellow's former students might have been  forgiven a moment's disbelief upon seeing him materialize in the first  frames of Woody Allen's mock-documentary Zelig as a plaid-shirted  academic talking like a book-jacket blurb. The "true story" about to  be reconstructed before us by a collage of doctored newsreel footage,  clippings, stills, and filmed interviews, blandly explained by a confident voiceover, has turned out to be, says the Bellow figure, "ironic,  astounding, amusing, bizarre."  What was Bellow doing there? What was Bellow doing there?? Had  he not, at the lectern and in literary reviews, often deplored the deprivation suffered by the writer who plays the celebrity game? As a talk-  show babbler under bright lights he loses his sufficient private time-  and-space and his necessary access to ordinary life.2 He has entered  the realm of what Bellow calls "the delirious professions" where he  lives to invent and reinvent an image of himself. Of his own more public  identity after Herzog's popular success, he said, "I have a longing, not  for downright obscurity—I'm too egotistical for that—but for peace,  and freedom from meddling."3  Yet, given the publicity afforded to a Nobel Prize winner's least  remark, trivial details of Bellow's life occasionally appear in the press.  We old Bellow-watchers, ignoring his sensible warnings against compulsive deep reading, tend to share these facts as literary in-jokes. When  Bellow turns up in The San Francisco Chronicle naming the "odd ingredients" he adds to a classic spaghetti sauce—"a mixture of red wine,  soy sauce, curry powder, and powdered ginger"—we see a witty recipe  for an eclectic style.4 When Time reports Bellow's description of his  daily headstand as "a reverse position" affording "an indispensable  change of perspective," we remember his Nobel Prize speech.5 There  he recommended our taking a fresh look at our old stock of ideas:  "With increasing frequency I dismiss, as merely respectable, opinions  I have long held—or thought I held—and try to discern what I have  really lived by."6  1 	asu06600000390003001							66255096 Bytes	3855	5727	2124690543	RGB	8	600	asu06600000390003001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1342	1342	1343.jp2	/asu0660/image/1343.jp2
Saul Bellow as Professor					Emery, Jane, 1917-																											asu0660000039	Perhaps he cannot ward off those minor trespasses on his social  and contemplative privacy, but what reasons persuaded Bellow to  undergo the tedium and exposure of movie making? My own pang of  dismay at this seeming lapse of principle subsided as Zelig developed.  Bellow was both in and out of Allen's game. The film itself is in part  an attack on the deadening distortions of the Mass Media. And both  artists have been persistent prop-knockers of pompous academics who  offer what Bellow calls stale cultural formulations and Total Explanations. In Annie Hall the Allen character drags forth the living Marshall McLuhan to confound the third-rate professor pontificating in  second-hand McLuhanisms to an unwilling audience trapped in a theater  queue. McLuhan is cold: "This man knows nothing of my work."  Bellow is more severe. He attacked McLuhan himself as a commercial  prophet of the apocalypse, a university based authority who became  the darling of the press. He added Leslie Fiedler to his dunciad as well.7  "How quickly," thinks Moses Herzog, with whom Bellow would not  here disagree, "do the visions of genius become the canned goods of  the intellectuals."8  The vignette appearance-and-reappearance of certified contemporary intellectual gurus is one of the comic motifs of Zelig. Susan Son-  tag, Bruno Bettleheim, John Norton Blum, Irving Howe—all a little  self-conscious in their self-parodies—generalize in aesthetic, historical,  psychological, and socio-literary-political terms on the phenomenon of  Leonard Zelig's absurdly conforming chameleon psyche. In contrast,  Allen and Bellow are concerned with his poignant human fragility.  ("Safe, I want to be safe," whispers the hypnotized Leonard to his  psychiatrist, Dr. Eudora Fletcher.) Disapproving of the Last Word on  any human being, Bellow offers a simply worded, memorable comment  at the close of his second cameo appearance—a description of Leonard  Zelig's paradoxical plight and suffering; "He wanted to be anonymous  and to be loved."  As a practicing university professor, Bellow prefers hard questions  and modest answers. The questions he posed for us in his 1967 University of Chicago graduate seminar, "Character in the Modern Novel,"  were deep-diving: "What kind of knowledge is the particular province  of this novel? Is there 'a normal life' here? What is omitted? Where  are the principles of order coming from? What makes you think realism  must be brutal?" The text was always before us, but the intellectual  range was broad. Theophrastus, Flaubert, and Max Weber might appropriately appear within a single quarter of an hour. But when we  began to prepare our term papers, Professor Bellow checked our intellectual pride. "Do not," he warned, "turn literature into arid 	asu06600000390004001							65751544 Bytes	3821	5734	3260693897	RGB	8	600	asu06600000390004001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1343	1343	1344.jp2	/asu0660/image/1344.jp2
Saul Bellow as Professor					Emery, Jane, 1917-																											asu0660000039	discourse." He cautioned us against over-confidence, predictability,  and verbosity, paused, and added a less conventional and more chilling word of advice, "Remember, I am very easily bored." It follows  that he wrote, "One of the nice things about Hamlet is that Polonius  is stabbed."9  But I do not believe, though I cannot know, that one more chance  to rebuke sententious complacency or to reveal the corrupting influence  of what he calls journalism's "event-consciousness" would offer sufficient temptation for Bellow to have made his film debut. In creating  Valentine Gerbasch and Dewey Spangler he has already punished the  Phoney and the Pundit of our time. There are other more positive and  more illuminating compatibilities between the fundamental assumptions  and the technique of Zelig and Bellow's own persistent beliefs and experiments which could have drawn him into cooperation with this  jocoserious work. Allen seems to believe in two of Bellow's principles:  "A few true impressions and a multitude of false ones make up most  of what we call life," . . . and "the first act of morality was to disinter  the reality, retrieve reality, dig it out from the trash, represent it as art  would represent it."10 The Proustian "true impressions" of Zelig are  visual and human—Zelig's anguished face and the unprofessionally  tender expressions of Dr. Eudora Fletcher. The "reality" is the rescue  of Zelig from fear by love; this embarrassingly old truth is excavated  from a house of cards—the trash of newspapers, records, souvenirs,  sheet music, gimmicks, photographs, and jerky black and white films  of official gestures and crowds of heartless gapers.  Acknowledging my considerable risk of comic academic seriousness  and far-fetched theory in making the comparison, I attended Zelig again  with a sceptical friend to test my analogy. I reread my old lecture notes  and, recalling Bellow's vivid teaching performance, heard once more  his careful definition of the writer-as-moralist-in-spite-of-himself, and  the dialogue between his fascination with ideas and his distrust of their  tyranny in life and art. The connections with Zelig survived and they  were an occasion for recalling Bellow in his inescapable adversarial role  as professor and my own experience as his student.  II  I began my formal preparation as a reader of Saul Bellow at four  o'clock, January 3, 1967, in a cheerless classroom of the Social Sciences  Building at The University of Chicago. Outside it was nearly dark. A  knifing wind controlled those walking; stop-and-go traffic controlled 	asu06600000390005001							67145608 Bytes	3908	5725	3095294014	RGB	8	600	asu06600000390005001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1344	1344	1345.jp2	/asu0660/image/1345.jp2

Indoors about twenty graduate students, newly arrived,  sat silent, staring at yellowed demographic charts, waiting for the steam  heat to penetrate their deadened feet and aching facial bones. Most  were men, dressed like privates in a badly disciplined army. Campus  strife and the Vietnam War were facts of the weather, too, and antiwar protesters, paradoxically, assumed the identity of guerillas.  Although we were awaiting the first entrance of Professor Saul  Bellow to teach "Character in the Modern Novel," there was little  dramatic expectancy. Our vulgar curiosity had earlier been satisfied,  for Bellow had interviewed and supposedly culled the group which had  been pre-registered. But his first words were stirring enough to rouse us:  This course will be taught from the writer's point of view.  These are subjects with which I have an obsessive familiarity. I am the single accredited pro here and I claim or confess to absorption in these problems.  So began those late winter afternoons of intellectual excitement during which students were sometimes taught, like Henderson, by blows.  Witty, charming, irritable, Bellow might say, "Don't be sassy," or to  the enthusiastically long-winded, "You lather here. You shave at  home." To the writer's mediations we readers could bring only amateur  critics' speculations. To one bright young man, offering an elaborate  analysis of the narrative strategies of the first chapter of Madame  Bovary, Bellow said, "Don't bother the thing too much. Fall back on  your own naivete. Sometimes a writer has to back in to his story." In  addition to the distance between the reader's and the writer's point of  view there were deeper gulfs between lecturer and students; they were  to find their expression in Mr. Sammler's Planet. Bellow was hostile  to the comfortable radical young. He disdained their moral and political  self-assurance, their collective ad hoc decisions, and their theatrical  claim to wretchedness. Entering one afternoon, splendid in a gold-  buttoned red velvet vest, he smiled at some of the ragged ones. "Now  I know what steerage looked like." He did not believe in their costumes  of poverty. Extremes, he thought, were childish. True radicalism, in  his opinion, is based on knowledge, not street theater. His own advice  to young writers was to follow a lonelier, less dogmatic life. "It is not  easy to find the right way. You must learn to govern yourself you must  manage your freedom or drown in it."11  But they had passed his entrance test and for the duration of the  course he admitted us all to the history and principles of his point of  view.  We were never advised on the criteria for success in that ordeal, 	asu06600000390006001							67271528 Bytes	3908	5736	1849384451	RGB	8	600	asu06600000390006001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1345	1345	1346.jp2	/asu0660/image/1346.jp2
Saul Bellow as Professor					Emery, Jane, 1917-																											asu0660000039	but in a university that prides itself on the rigor of its oral examinations, preparation for such screening interviews is made in a spirit of  bravado, paranoia, and intellectual gamesmanship. (One defeated candidate, emerging from the notorious Seventy-five Book Exam of the  English Department, moaned to his supportive comrades waiting anxiously in the hall with the equivalent of blankets-and-brandy, "They  found the periphery of my knowledge and camped there.") The doctoral candidate's goal is to achieve well-founded confidence or to  simulate it persuasively; in extremis the alternatives are graceful modesty  or intellectual tact. If wit is used as an evasion it must be of a high  order, preferably skilled, allusive word play; it should be a last resort.  The approved strategy of study goes beyond mastery of the material;  one is advised to foreshadow the questions by studying the questioners.  I made my appointment with Professor Bellow's secretary and tried  to imagine the coming encounter. I began a skimming reread of the  classic novels assigned as texts: Notes from Underground, The Death  of Ivan Ilych, The Red and the Black, Pere Goriot, Madame Bovary,  and Jude the Obscure. I read our critical text, Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature. Bellow's obligatory interview  was a splendid pedagogical ploy. I was well into the course and had  not even been accepted.  More help in preparation were Bellow's critical articles and a hard  look at his perfectly suited post in the university. In 1957 he had posed  and faced the first question that rose in my mind: "Are writers greatly  harmed by teaching in universities?" The first axiom he offered in  answer was flippant: "You can make a damn fool of yourself anywhere." But his corollary was transcendental: "You may find illumination anywhere."12 No writer, he advised, should seek Experience to write  about it. If he is bold, energetic, and open to the workings of the mysterious spirit, he cannot escape what he needs to feel—the pervasive  power of life. The university is no hermit's cave. "I have seen full-blown  lunatics in universities, too, and as for the vices, they may be found  on the campus no less than on the Bowery."13  The Augie March tone is only intermittent. Bellow gives a better  clue to his eventual choice of his particular university post by adding  that the writer "will very often find good conversation in university  communities."14 Bellow has always praised free and lively talk and he  has since 1962 enjoyed Olympian and convivial conversation at The  University of Chicago as a member of the prestigious Committee of  Social Thought, a body described in the catalogue as having "a corporate intellectual life."  The Committee is a male world, although there was one woman 	asu06600000390007001							66854096 Bytes	3879	5743	2079556099	RGB	8	600	asu06600000390007001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1346	1346	1347.jp2	/asu0660/image/1347.jp2
Saul Bellow as Professor					Emery, Jane, 1917-																											asu0660000039	member in 1967 and there is one today. It has not been long since the  catalogue was changed to read, "It is assumed that core texts are the  common property of men and women." (One of Bellow's visions of  an admirable woman can be found in his documentary To Jerusalem  and Back, "The Professor, in patriarchal style, is served first. His wife,  pleased with all he does, all he says, visibly dotes on him .... A rare  sight this, in an age of embattled women. Yet who could fail to share  the pleasure the soft and gentle Mrs. Werblowsky takes in her husband,  as he lounges in his large chair, presiding over the table.")15  As a doctoral candidate in the English Department, which had at  that time no women faculty members, I began to study the history, self-  definition, and protocol of another Chicago intellectual milieu where  women were minor characters.  The Committee on Social Thought was founded as an interdisciplinary body in the mid-thirties when such a concept was uncommon.  As a small body of scholars of diverse specialties, it shares a common  concern for the unity of human sciences, a vision of learning flowering  from the Robert Maynard Hutchins days and known best to most  Americans through The Great Books Program: "the Committee aims  both to teach precision of scholarship and to foster awareness of "the  permanent questions at the origin of human inquiry." (Italics mine.)  The Committee has been degree-granting since 1941; master's degrees  were still offered in the 60's, but only doctor's candidates need apply  today. The Committee members, twelve in 1967, twenty-one today, have  included over the years theologians, classicists, mathematicians, linguists, philosophers, lawyers, historians, economists, and sociologists.  If Bellow in 1988 had invited a group of colleagues to a Symposiumlike dinner party, he could have chosen from a list including Edward  Levi, Professor Emeritus in Law, former President of the University  and one-time attorney-General of the United States; a distinguished Professor of Mathematics; an honored Comparative Urban Geographer;  and Bellow's friend Edward A. Shils, Distinguished Service Professor  of Social Thought and of Sociology, who once said to Bellow that the  intellectual life was the most passionate life a man could lead. But  because the Committee is proudly conscious of its connections with the  intellectual world beyond the university, the guest list need not be limited  to Hyde Park. Bellow, an anthropologist, is attracted to worldly types  as well; the conversation could have considerable scope.  Student applicants for degree candidature in the Committee face  this formidable admissions board. Aspirants must demonstrate a large  grasp of mind, the power to write accomplished prose destined for  publication—and, what may be even more difficult to document—the 	asu06600000390008001							66766732 Bytes	3863	5759	3244838905	RGB	8	600	asu06600000390008001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1347	1347	1348.jp2	/asu0660/image/1348.jp2

Saul Bellow as Professor					Emery, Jane, 1917-																											asu0660000039	qualities of habit and character that will insure their finishing their work  without the waste of such brilliant tutelage.  Over the years Bellow has taught, alone and jointly, courses in  writers, social thinkers, and philosophers with special enduring interest  for him: in my day Blake, Nietzsche, and De Toqueville were persistent listings. But his interests as a thinker-teacher-writer are broad, deep  and wide-ranging: if I were preparing to meet him today I would have  to take recent emphases into account. He offered courses in Owen Bar-  field and Ben Jonson in the early eighties; last year he taught a course  entitled Comedies with colleague Alan Bloom (Co-Director of the John  M. Olin Center for Inquiry into the Theory and Practice of Democracy  and author of The Closing of the American Mind). The texts were from  Aristophanes, Swift, Moliere, Rousseau and Celine. This Winter Quarter he is teaching, with David Grene, a course centering on that seminal  novel of the turn of the century, Samuel Butler's The Way of All Flesh.  Characteristic dissertation topics in the fields of philosophy and letters  in which he may well have taken an interest or supervised are "Politics  and Art in William Blake," "Nietzsche's Image of Socrates," and "Fin-  negans Wake—A New Reality: Essays on Sex and Metaphysics."  But quite as important as this world of rarefied talk as an element  in Bellow's teaching and writing was and is the image of Professor  Moses Herzog's old valise, bursting its sides on the closet floor, pouring out "eight hundred pages of chaotic argument which has never  found its focus," representing "the comic impossibility of arriving at  a synthesis that can satisfy modern demands."16 Intellectual excitement  seems to mean a great deal to Bellow, but he is not deluded by the promise of a thought system that can meet our moral needs.  And in his opinion Art must not depend on ideology. In "The Writer  as Moralist," he writes, "An Art which is to be strong cannot be based  on opinions. Opinions can be accepted, questioned, and dismissed. A  work of art cannot be questioned or dismissed." In 1967 he gave a well-  attended talk to resisting students called "A Maverick at the University," supporting the privileged position of art. In To Jerusalem and Back  he quotes from Andrei Sinyavsky's prison journal:  We have come into the world in order to understand certain things. Only a few things, very few, but exceedingly important .... Art is a meeting place, of the author and the  object of his love, of spirit and matter, of truth and fantasy,  of the line traced by a pencil, the contour of a body, of one  word with another. These meetings are rare, unexpected.  "Is that you? Is it you?" Recognizing each other, both 	asu06600000390010001							66181496 Bytes	3846	5734	2090714205	RGB	8	600	asu06600000390010001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1349	1349	1350.jp2	/asu0660/image/1350.jp2

In these gestures  of surprise and joy we see art.17  In the end the preliminary reading which best helped me understand  the direction which the course was going to take was a short paragraph  which had a link to this definition. Bellow's thought moves from the  consideration of the materialistic grounds for modern literary realism  to a question about the grounds for spiritual belief:  The presentation of things is imperative, for the things of  a man's life are important. They are important because  man's career on this earth is important. Literature has been  committed to the assertions of this importance for a long  time. Unquestioned value? But what is the source of the  value? (Italics mine.)18  By this time, suffering from intellectual indigestion and self-doubt,  I began to dread the appointment. The interview was, of course, an  anti-climax to the preparation. My grasp of the material seemed firm  enough to get me through fifteen minutes, but I had other concerns.  Mysogyny does not seem too strong a term to characterize some  thoughts of Bellow's male characters, although it is a freshman error  to take these for the authorial voice. Yet many of his women characters  have what he calls only enough feeling for their own lives.  I was what Americans today call, in a pleasant euphemism, "a reentry student." I was a middle-aged matron from Glen Ellyn, teaching  at the University of Illinois Chicago Circle, and was half way through  my course work at Chicago. Would Bellow decide I might be a mono-  loguist of suburban maternal psychology, a type for which he has an  acute aversion?  Professor Bellow was courteous, brisk, and cool. The invisible sign  on the wall said, "Don't waste my time." We assumed the positions  of the classic inquisitorial tableau: he sat with his back to the windows;  I sat facing him across the desk. My chair was very low.  As it progressed the questioning seemed purely factual: "What is  the history of your reading life? What philosophy have you studied?  Modern History? The Great Books? Intellectual History? Do you read  French? Russian? Students should read at least one of these novels in  the original."  A pause. I had satisfied the pre-requisites, yet afterwards I realized  that as we moved from one area to the other I had been offered opportunities to make connections. Some leaps I took naturally; other links  occurred to me out in the hall. A few jokes were made.

Topic not focused."  The English Department had considered this (in 1967) an unpromising  topic, written-out, unlikely to lead to publication; one supervisor called  it "a musty choice." I knew that Bellow had classed Woolf as "a  novelist of the sensibility."  He made a quick, shrewd appraisal, seeming to ask, "Is this an il-  luminable type?" I had not made the faux pas of mentioning his novels.  I resolved not to leave my briefcase behind.  He rose with the practiced skill of one who often closes off conversations. "You will hear from my secretary next week." A smile. I did  not think that I would get the job. When permission came, I felt an  unwarranted triumph. It is possible, I thought much later, that no one  had been rejected.  The course had a physical shape that rose up about us in the first  two weeks. For two one-hour-and-a-half sessions, twice a week, for  ten weeks, we met in the nadir of the day. Professor Bellow talked for  a little less than an hour; the questioning began. First we learned what  the course was not. Unlike Nabokov, Bellow did not hold the books  aloft like shimmering prisms and delight in their forms. I cannot remember anyone's mentioning the word "beauty." The forms of modernism were considered to be enemies of the novel's life. Critical jargon  was forbidden; the word "plot" was irrelevant. Although the fictional  theories of Sheldon Sacks and Wayne Booth were central subjects of  interest in the English Department, they were not part of our vocabulary  there. No aesthetic theory, no stylistic theory—although the brilliance  of Mimesis consists in part of close textual analysis, we rarely used the  technique. But we knew why he had asked our reading history. The  assigned texts were only central points of reference. (Small wonder that  he teaches with Alan Bloom.) The first lecture included a comparison  of Balzac and Stendahl, but Arthur Miller, Shakespeare, Baudelaire,  Henry James, and Rimbaud stood round about them. The large, slippery terms of cultural history, so hedged about with definitions in  English seminars, were freely used. His method was to compare the  central relationships between fictional worlds and the novelist's assumptions about human nature, experience, moral values, and art. I felt as  though I were watching Professor Bellow walking in ever-widening  circles, touching the books that we read serially, returning, questioning, entertaining his sibling rivals and friends as well; James, Joyce,  Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and Forster appeared and reappeared. Jane  Austen was mentioned once; George Eliot never.

All this rich meditation was set in the great drama with which  the course opened; Romanticism and the Rise of Realism.  A Chicago Daily News reporter visited an early meeting of our class,  recording her impressions in a story published on February 18, 196719:  "Every chair was filled, and the students, all hand-picked, most of them  budding writers, maintained a kind of attentive silence you expect but  don't get in a concert hall." (She did not know that the class was small;  after the first meeting, over half the audience were auditors whom  Bellow allowed to attend but forbade to speak.)  Alice Hoge's verbatim quotations sum up for the newspaper reader  the focus of the day's topics and problems: an inquiry into the accountability of the novelist, focused on Balzac and Flaubert (and Herzog?).  In effect our field of discussion was an analysis of social realism and  the role of the imagination. "How much of his own time should a  novelist chronicle? Should an artist's virtuosity assume as much importance as his subject? Is the function of language to transmit or to  evoke?" (Our inquisitor expected us to point out that the last question  was oversimplified.)  Later Bellow commented about the students to Hoge, "They're very  bright. This university allows them time to develop ideas." He never  offered such praise to us. Clearly he was bent on instilling in us doubts  about any neat critical systems or theories we might be cherishing.  Characteristically that day, his last throwaway questions were designed  to unsettle us: "Can your character think his way out of despair? But,  in the end, isn't the world too much for each and every one of us?"  Gradually we began to see that some of the formulations were not  new (nor were they claimed to be), but the language was so fresh that  we came upon them as for the first time. Examples illuminated the  abstractions. There were amusements along the way: Romantics were  "seduced by the elsewhere." Balzac was not as fastidious as Stendahl;  he delivered details "like a man delivering a load of coals." (Chicagoans  could appreciate the simile.)  Along with the comparative development of the study, telegrams  were issued—aphorisms, commands, Wisdom, Saul's Proverbs:  "Readiness to answer all questions is the infallible sign of stupidity."  "We know all kinds of things, but not what we most need to know."  "Books are hard on bookish people." "We don't yet know enough  to despair." "There is no fitter role in high society than the fool."  "Style coming in can depress human values." "Didacticism becomes  art when views most opposite to the author's are allowed to exist in  full strength." Taking every dose of this medicine was not compulsory,  11 	asu06600000390013001							66527664 Bytes	3848	5761	1688618921	RGB	8	600	asu06600000390013001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1352	1352	1353.jp2	/asu0660/image/1353.jp2
Saul Bellow as Professor					Emery, Jane, 1917-																											asu0660000039	but we knew these were his prescriptions, as the single accredited pro.  As we worked in circles, the undergirding structure of the philosophical questions was built up. Sallies at the students marked the  dialogue, but the questions were relentless. "What is observed and  understood here? What is praised? What is respected and why? Is this  world a workable thing? In what form is it justified? What is necessary?  What is death-dealing? Where are the values coming from here? Is there  an adequate idea of self-hood?" Woody Aliens all, we were trying to  retrieve "the true impressions" from these classic novels. A kind of  Ontology of Fiction developed. Our own sense of the belief structures  began to be stronger than our aesthetic knack of mixing and matching  details. We were not allowed Bellow's metaphoric answers. We were  exhilarated. We were exhausted. The course seemed to end very quickly.  Notes  1. John Updike as quoted in America, February 20, 1982.  2.

And what he did not or forgot  to write, seems to be waiting  inside the stone.  2) BELOVED'S STONE  There is an archaic smile  and large, sightless eyes. Gaze on,  you who are not afraid to stay forever,  for she is what you wish her to be  despite your will.  And the longer you  stare at her ancient, almost vanished  face, the more you will see yourself  or whom you wish to be.  There is  a stone rose, but no name or date.

And what I said  in love and lust and anger and pride and  humiliation, has been cleaned away.  And now I can rest at last, having  delivered my message.  4) LOVER'S STONE  Here is a pillow that can hold your head  as long as the dream lasts  and then some.  But if  a couple should sneak in at night  to make love on your grassy mound, then  you are awake and raging  into the hunger you thought you had  escaped.  And the ghost of a hard  cartilage rises to transfix them.  They will come back again, and  the baby that wakes from the little death  will be his day's Don Juan.  5) FRIEND'S STONE  How many years in brown earth  before red blood turns green?

Her white brocade seems about to tear  over the sharp nipples, their cold fire;  and he about to fall to his knees, the  armored elephant before his mouse,  thunderous in dust and blood, suddenly  ashamed of size and what those hands  have done,  about to seize, gently,  the brocaded knees, dreaming Gramercy,  her belly round as a moon, carved Virgin,  he being Joseph,  of his boyhood vision.  7) POET'S STONE  Thin, handcarved granite  on a late Autumn ground. Bare trees  rattle in bright wind.  The profile,  olive crowned, rubbed almost featureless  by rain's immense, most personal hands.  Bird lime  adorns the pure hills  of a woman's forms in low relief. He  gazes on, sightless, like an Oedipus  his Sphinx.  On stones around, leaning  awry, in armor of stonestiff metalrings,  with years of light etched to a delicate  arabesque of force, stand his  guardians,  the knights.  15 	asu06600000390017001							67334028 Bytes	3902	5750	2846442112	RGB	8	600	asu06600000390017001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1356	1356	1357.jp2	/asu0660/image/1357.jp2

Jorie Graham's Hybrids of Plants and of Ghosts: Nature as Matrix					Reaves, Gerri, 1951-																											asu0660000039	Gerri Reaves  Jorie Graham's Hybrids of Plants and of Ghosts:  Nature as Matrix  In her collection of poetry, Hybrids of Plants and of Ghosts, Jorie  Graham consistently reinforces an equivalency between nature and the  ineffable, and grounds her ideas in the matrix of nature. Graham overlays the texts of her poems on a larger text (nature), which enfolds,  absorbs, and highlights the smaller text of each individual poem.  Graham's language, the very raw material of her craft, is adequate in  her search for the "pure idea,,(31), for her meaning is not found in  the words themselves, but in the process hidden between the lines. Meaning is discovered by the reader and the poet, not arrived at through  a poetic equation—a contrived pattern or rhythm of words. Meaning  bleeds through Graham's language and shifts from one reading to the  next. These shifts in meaning and language become part of the ever-  evolving process of her poems, not merely the medium for conveying  a prepackaged message.  Graham herself enters the poetic process rather than simply manipulating it. Far from seeming controlled and deliberate, the meaning in  Graham's poetic method resides not in the words themselves, but in  the spaces between them. This quality accounts for that certain shimmering magic we feel in her work.  In Hybrids of Plants and of Ghosts, Jorie Graham juxtaposes the  abstract and the tangible, the symbolic and the real. Her method can  best be paraphrased in her own words from "Harvest for Bergson"(25):  .... For moonlight  blurs the facts,  its shade not keen or rational like that of sunlight  seeking to capture the nature of its subject;  it seeks, rather, to let it go,  to show what it is not ....  Her words are analogous to the sunlight trying to contain and define  reality as clearly defined objects. Only by being receptive and "letting  go" can we receive the truth her poem embodies. Paradoxically focusing simultaneously on both the clearly defined sunlit object and on its  counterpart blurred in moonlight, she expresses her "pure idea."  Graham's poems are similar to haiku poetry, not in form, but in their  35 	asu06600000390037001							66279396 Bytes	3845	5744	482753196	RGB	8	600	asu06600000390037001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1376	1376	1377.jp2	/asu0660/image/1377.jp2
Jorie Graham's Hybrids of Plants and of Ghosts: Nature as Matrix					Reaves, Gerri, 1951-																											asu0660000039	verbal economy and their allusions to inexpressible subjective states.  She emphasizes what is not said, but what is alluded to—the spaces  around the poem.  In "The Way Things Work"(3), the central images of blurring and  merging are overtly stated, and the motif of Rothko's painting (which  appears on the book's cover) emerges. This opening poem to the collection contains the core idea which resonates through Graham's work:  process. The title itself merges into the text of the poem: "The Way  Things Work/is by admitting/or opening away." The "Blue/moving  through blue" and "blue through purple" recall the Rothko painting,  an apt visual symbol for Graham's life-in-process. Central, too, is the  poem's tribute to the tangible. The abstract opening in which colors  merge into and become other colors develops into a tribute to definable  objects in nature, objects associated with how things work on the  tangible level: "ingots, levers and keys," and "cylinder lock, pulley,  lifting tackle." Her refrain of faith, "I believe in you . . ./I  believe/forever in the hooks," affirms her connection to the tangible  and the real, although the goal is that indefinable sensation when  "something catches."  In the poem "Penmanship" (31), the equivalencies between text and  nature, and between the human and the natural realms are established.  Letters of the alphabet take on the characteristics and actions of animate  objects. The alphabet moves across the page as objects move across  the landscape. L's are "eyes" in "single file";/s are "shut umbrellas";  and the entire alphabet, "our frigid school of twenty-six," swims "upstream." The "margin" of the "page" is equated to "an empty beach"  or a "desert." At the poem's close, the letters, visible, understandable  symbols existing on a human landscape (the page), "[narrow] their aim"  and [shed] their forms for a meaning they can only allude to and yearn  toward: "a pure idea, a thought as true as/not true, ..."  Graham's poems inscribe themselves on the larger text of nature,  their edges blurring and merging into the larger subject like one color  bleeding into another. Often, human objects or the human body is  transposed onto the larger one of nature, or an inanimate object  metamorphizes into an animate object. A "shuttlecock" transforms  into a blooming gardenia ("Angels for Cezanne" 10). The human body  becomes "the sides of a riverbed giving in" ("Tennessee June" 8). The  poet's face, which "flower[s]" when she looks at herself in the mir-  row, is a "rock" camouflaged with "lichen" and "blistering with  motive" ("My face in the Mirror Tells a Story of Delicate Ambitions"  50). Tangible objects are imprinted on and merge with the landscape  of nature while still paradoxically retaining a double identity: as an in-  36 	asu06600000390038001							65487792 Bytes	3852	5665	3117094473	RGB	8	600	asu06600000390038001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1377	1377	1378.jp2	/asu0660/image/1378.jp2
Jorie Graham's Hybrids of Plants and of Ghosts: Nature as Matrix					Reaves, Gerri, 1951-																											asu0660000039	dividual object (e.g., shuttlecock, face) and as part of a larger network  (e.g., a gardenia bush, a mirror, a rocky landscape). Her language  reveals life as a network, an all-encompassing world of which everything  is but a facet, just as each of her poems is one small facet of her poetic  vision.  One of Graham's central images is that of "stitching," an image  that can be taken on a literal level, as in "Mother's Sewing Box" (18),  or on a cosmic level with stitching as the activity that links spirits  together and unifies human experience. Again, a small-scale, simple  human activity and its raw materials are analogous to natural processes,  or vice versa. Here, Graham imposes the natural image on the human  activity: "On the string/the knots are birds that sit,/that cannot leave."  Solitary, ordinary objects thread themselves together and transform  themselves: "The spools of thread/form a train"; and "swarms/of  starling cry we are pins,/pins." In "Strangers" (12), "starlings keep  trying/to thread the eyes/of steeples." The image of birds sitting like  knots on a string recurs when "songbirds . . . line up on the wires/as  if to make of their bodies/small notes" ("The Chicory Comes Out Late  August in Umbria" 20). Here, the birds merge with yet another network or pattern—the structure of a musical staff on the page.  Stitching or weaving also serves as a metaphor for spiritual connection in Graham's work. In "Still Life" (51), such images occur in  almost every stanza and reinforce the parallel between the unity in  nature and the unity among the human species. Two maple trees "weave  a third" tree capable of "hold[ing] us,/like the body." The poet contemplates journeying over a landscape described as "that trusty fabric."  With their "small leaps," squirrels stitch together separated trees. And  we, too, are linked together spiritually by a "spirit . . . that threads  us." Graham's poem's capture a still frame, a moment within a  process—what might be called "knots" (often symbolized as birds)—  which are junctures in the weave, momentary realizations, glimpses of  a consciousness we share with everything beyond the boundaries of  ourselves.  Graham uses deceptively simple language, and is therefore seemingly accessible to any audience. But her sentences and phrases of everyday language do not always add up to meaningful, easily decipherable  sentences. Nor do Graham's poems, primarily driven by images and  sensation, rely on any kind of cause-effect structure. Such sentences  as "To disobey/is to hide or to be/unmended" ("Mother's Sewing  Box" 18) defy conventional interpretation. The sentence structure is  simple and the words are ordinary; however, only by applying our sense  of what mending means to Graham can we begin to decipher the poem.  37 	asu06600000390039001							66565968 Bytes	3888	5705	1299972884	RGB	8	600	asu06600000390039001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1378	1378	1379.jp2	/asu0660/image/1379.jp2
Jorie Graham's Hybrids of Plants and of Ghosts: Nature as Matrix					Reaves, Gerri, 1951-																											asu0660000039	With the exception of occasional allusions to artists (e.g., Cezanne,  Rothko), writers (e.g., Eluard and Voltaire), and other well-known  figures (e.g., Bergson and Montesquieu), Graham's poetry is almost  free of allusion, largely self-referential, and ahistorical. Her embracing of the multiplicity of human experience mirrors her uncynical,  positive vision. Recurring words such as web, pattern, plot, loom,  weave, texture, and necklace point to Graham's vision of linking  disparate elements into cohesive units that add up to something larger  than the sum of their parts—a network or matrix. In "I Was Taught  Three" (4), she first compares language to nature, then links that image to a real tree outside her window, and then merges her identity with  the tree: "... the leaves/silent as suppressed desires, and I/a name  among them." This linking and comparing traces, in a series of  overlaps, the move from symbolic, to the natural and the real, and to  the personal. The "human tree" dissolves into the "I" who becomes  only one individual noun on the "human tree." Her language evokes  both a vivid visual image and a working image that link it with unifying concepts outside the poem—timelessness, spirituality, and the in-  terconnectedness of life.  "The Geese" (39), is an especially comprehensive and dense  amalgamation of Graham's imagery, poetic vision, and method. Again,  we see the fabric of language as a system overlaying the text of nature  and the spiritual realm Graham equates with nature. Commenting on  how "the everyday, takes place," Graham freezes a moment in which  the geese cross over her as she stands at the clothesline. Once again,  birds are language, symbols in a sign system; they form a "code." They  have been crossing "for days," thus simultaneously giving the illusion  of constant movement and of stillness. The geese embody two opposing conceptions of time: forward-moving, linear, human time; and the  eternal moment. The language of the poem is rich in words that double as references to writing and texts, and to the concrete scene described: e.g., "heading," "lines," and "bind." Spiders stitch the  clotheslines together with their webs, creating yet another fabric and  writing between the "lines." The poet is concerned that "things will  not remain connected,/will not heal," and laments that "the world  thickens with texture instead of history." At the end of the poem, we  are stretched between two spheres—the air with its "codes" and geese,  and the earth—as we bind existence together to prevent things from  "fall[ing] further apart."  Transcending her subject and vehicle (language) is precisely what  Graham does beautifully and, it seems, effortlessly, without a trace of  intellectualizing. Her poems do not become their own subjects.

With Graham poetry, it is never enough to think; we must  feel. Her poems scintillate; we find her meaning in the "aura" around  the words, not in the words themselves or in the textual construction  labeled "a poem." We sense her delight and faith in simultaneously  celebrating and transcending the temporal world, and appreciate her  unrestrained and sensual openness. It is not only the moment that  Graham attempts to capture and celebrate, but existence itself.  Graham, Jorie. Hybrids of Plants and of Ghosts. Princeton: Princeton UP, 1980.

Zora Neale Hurston					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000021	THE  CARRE LL  Volume 11 June-December 1970 Numbers 1 & 2  Zora Neale Hurston*  Evelyn Thomas Helmick*  Even as a young girl, Zora Neale Hurston remembered,  "I had the map of Dixie on my tongue." She was able  to draw that map in language of great vitality in her four  novels, an autobiography, and two books of folklore, all written  during the thirties and forties. Interest in those books, which  won great critical acclaim at the time of their publication, is reviving today; their author, as a fascinating personality, an anthropologist, and an outspoken Negro observer of racial problems, is due no less attention.  Zora Neale Hurston was born on Juanary 7, 1901, in Eaton-  ville, Florida, an all-Negro town near Orlando.1 Her father was  John Hurston, carpenter, minister and mayor who considered  his older daughter too full of spirit to survive in a white-dominated world. Her mother was Lucy Ann Potts, who married  John Hurston at fourteen and bore him eight children before  she died when Zora Neale was nine, leaving the child with no  one to encourage her to "jump at de sun."  "Passed around like a bad penny" for the next several years,  Zora Neale became an introspective young lady. Her closest  friend was an elderly white man who had passed the Hurston  cottage at the moment of her birth and became responsible for  her safe delivery. For a time, he tried to guide her, but he too  died when she was ten. Alone, she retreated to a world of fantasy  remarkable for its inventiveness and intensity. One passage in  her autobiography, for example, recounts her anguish at discovering that the moon followed not only her, but the other  *Dr. Helmick is an associate professor of English at the University of Miami. 	asu06600000210003001							65886912 Bytes	3849	5704	1012652060	RGB	8	600	asu06600000210003001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1387	1387	1388.jp2	/asu0660/image/1388.jp2
Zora Neale Hurston					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000021	children as well. She created dolls of corn shucks and clear  bars of soap and for years imagined events in their lives. Very  early she began to make up stories to match those she heard  the men tell in their "lying sessions" at the general store. In her  world of constant fiction her imagination was so stirred that the  trees and animals seemed to talk to her; eventually she had  visions of her future which recurred frequently until each was  fulfilled.  Her inventive habits would seem good practice for a future  novelist, but Zora Neale discovered obstacles in the way of her  learning the more formal tools of the profession. She attended  school only sporadically and, worse, lived with families who had  no books for her to read. The desolation of those years can best  be told in her own words:  There is something about poverty that smells like death. Dead  dreams dropping off the heart like leaves in a dry season and  rotting around the feet; impulses smothered too long in the  fetid air of underground caves. The soul lives in a sickly air.  People can be slave-ships in shoes.2  Her hopes for school rose when her brother sent for her to  live with his family and were dashed when she discovered she  was to be a full-time unpaid maid. With the help of friends, she  ran away to become a lady's maid to a singer, who offered friendship, learning, and finally assistance with Zora Neale's return  to school. When the singer left the touring company, they were  in Baltimore; there the lady's maid became a student again.  She attended night school for a few weeks, but was encouraged  by sympathetic teachers to enter the preparatory division of  Morgan College. Both delighted and somewhat awed by the  good looks and manners of her classmates, who were children  of the members of a wealthy Negro community, she became  conscious of her own appearance, as this passage in her autobiography reveals:  And here I was, with my face looking like it had been chopped  out of a knot of pine wood with a hatchet on somebody's off  day, sitting up in the middle of all this pretty. To make things  worse, I had only one dress, a change of underwear and one  pair of tan oxfords.3  But the young people were friendly and, more importantly, her 	asu06600000210004001							65304760 Bytes	3821	5695	2854422342	RGB	8	600	asu06600000210004001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1388	1388	1389.jp2	/asu0660/image/1389.jp2
Zora Neale Hurston					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000021	teachers were exciting. "The atmosphere made me feel right,"  she said. "Every new thing I learned in school made me happy."  Her experience was so satisfying that she planned to stay at  Morgan for her college work. But an acquaintance, the daughter  of a Howard University professor, made her consider that school  seriously. She was able to earn her tuition and board working  as a waitress and later as a manicurist in Washington. In all,  she did a year and a half of work at Howard, losing some months  because of illness.  Even holding a full-time job, she was able to take part in all  the literary activities on campus, and soon her abilities earned  her membership in The Stylus, a small literary society. A short  story which she wrote for the organization's journal brought her  work to the attention of Charles Johnson, founder of the Negro  Renaissance taking place at the time. He published two of Zora  Neale's short stories, "Drenched in Light" and "Spunk," in his  Opportunity Magazine. His encouragement took her to New  York, even though she had only $1.50 and no prospects for a  job there. The Johnsons helped with food, money, and friendship, and through Dr. Johnson's admiration for her work came  a prize for a short story at the first award dinner of Opportunity  in 1925. That prize led to further good fortune: Fanny Hurst  offered her a job as secretary and a home; Annie Nathan Meyer,  a trustee of Barnard, obtained a scholarship to that school for her.  Like all her other educational experiences, Barnard brought  great pleasure to her. The Social Register crowd, she said, soon  took her up, and she became "Barnard's sacred black cow. If  you had not had lunch with me, you had not shot from taw."  Academic life was as glorious as social life. She had planned to  major in English, but showed such promise in an anthropology  course that her term paper was shown to Dr. Franz Boas, the  chairman of the department, who was to Zora Neale "the king  of kings." She worked under Gladys Reichert and Ruth Benedict  as well, accomplishing so much before she graduated in 1928  —the second Negro to be awarded a degree by Barnard—that  Dr. Boas arranged a Rosenwald graduate fellowship for her.  The results of the first six months of her project—to collect  3  • 	asu06600000210005001							66716192 Bytes	3892	5712	1126666724	RGB	8	600	asu06600000210005001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1389	1389	1390.jp2	/asu0660/image/1390.jp2
Zora Neale Hurston					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000021	folklore of the South—were disappointing. Recognizing that her  approach in "Barnardese" was wrong, she corrected it for her  next field trip to her home country, and thus was able to find  many stories and work songs, particularly in the sawmills and  phosphate mines of Polk County. From there she traveled to  New Orleans, where her interest turned to Hoodoo, or "sympathetic magic" as she called it. She studied the lore with the Frizzly Rooster and other "two-headed doctors," each time submitting to elaborate initiation ceremonies. Moving on to the  Bahamas, then to the British West Indies and Haiti, she discovered other Hoodoo rites of the natives. In Nassau she was  enchanted by the subjects which the natives "put in sing" and  by their "jumping dances." She attended every dance she could  and learned to "jump." On her return to New York in 1932 she  introduced these Bahamian folk songs and dances in order to  "show what beauty and appeal there was in genuine Negro  material, as against the Broadway concept." Her production,  called "From Sun to Sun," was successful, both in New York  and in many other cities throughout the country.  In 1932 there was little money for research grants; Miss  Hurston was forced, perhaps fortunately, to return to her native village of Eatonville to begin writing. Her first project was  to edit the material she had gathered in four years of field work  in the southern states. The resulting book, entitled Mules and  Men, is comprised of an introduction by Franz Boas, a section  on folk tales, one on Hoodoo, and an appendix containing Negro  songs with music, formulae of Hoodoo doctors, a list of paraphernalia of conjure, prescriptions of root doctors, and a glossary. The beginning is in the form of a first-person narrative of  Miss Hurston's return to Eatonville with its "love of talk and  song." There follow many simple tales, often with little point,  told merely for the joy of storytelling. Some are the Brer Rabbit  stories so popular in the South; others are tall tales of the lumber  camp; many are stories in dialect filled with an ironic sense of  the Negro's destiny in a white man's world.4  One "lying session" of lumberjacks is a contest to describe  an ugly man. One speaker says, "Ah seen a man so ugly till they  had to spread a sheet over his head so sleep could slip up on 	asu06600000210006001							65324168 Bytes	3828	5686	796430880	RGB	8	600	asu06600000210006001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1390	1390	1391.jp2	/asu0660/image/1391.jp2

Those men y'all been talkin' 'bout wasn't ugly at all.  Those was pretty men. Ah knowed one so ugly till you could  throw him in the Mississippi River and skim ugly for six  months." When he is declared the winner of the contest, another  man agrees, "He ain't lying. Ah knowed dat same man. He  didn't die — he jus' uglied away."  A constant subject in Miss Hurston's work is the language of  the South; naturally, dialect figures prominently. One example in  Mules and Men is a recording of her conversation with a lumber  worker in the Everglades:  "Ma'am, whut might be yo' entrimmins?"  "My whut?"  "Yo' entrimmins? Yo' entitlums?"  The "entitlums," says Miss Hurston, gave her the cue. "Oh,  my name is Zora Hurston. And what may be yours?" With her  gift for capturing authentic sounds and syntax, she can write long  passages in dialect without wearying her reader.  The introduction to part two of the book explains that she had  enjoyed gathering folktales in Florida, but had done nothing  about Hoodoo. "So I slept a night, and the next morning I headed my toe-nails toward Louisiana and New Orleans in particular." In New Orleans, the Hoodoo capital of America, her  preparation to become a practitioner included fasting, meditation, drinking of blood, and animal sacrifice. Although the  rituals of worship are bound in secrecy, Hoodoo is not, she insists, drum-beating and dancing. "Hoodoo, or Voodoo, as pronounced by the whites, is burning with a flame in America, with  all the intensity of a suppressed religion."  Although Mules and Men was the first book Miss Hurston  wrote, the first published was a novel, Jonah's Gourd Vine. The  idea had come to her, she said, in 1929, when she was researching in the South, but she postponed writing it because she was  expected, as a black, to write about the racial problem. "My  interest," she said,  lies in what makes a man or woman do such-and-so, regardless  of his color. It seemed to me that the human beings I met re- 	asu06600000210007001							66736052 Bytes	3900	5702	1884020745	RGB	8	600	asu06600000210007001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1391	1391	1392.jp2	/asu0660/image/1392.jp2
Zora Neale Hurston					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000021	acted pretty much to the same stimuli. Different idioms, yes.  Circumstances and conditions having power to influence, yes.  Inherent difference, no.5  But the publication of a short story, "The Gilded Six-Bits,"  brought inquiries from several editors. The gentlest of them,  from J. B. Lippincott, encouraged Miss Hurston to reply that  she was writing a book, even though the first page was not  written. But as she said in her autobiography, "the story told  itself to me"; she completed the novel in three months in the  fall of 1933.  The most striking thing about Jonah's Gourd Vine is the correlation between the novel and the young Zora's early years.  The protagonist is John Pearson, a man whose life parallels the  life of John Hurston in every verifiable way. Both arrive from  "over the creek" to court a girl namey Lucy Potts, gravitate to  Eatonville to become carpenter and minister, marry a predatory  woman after Lucy dies, lose favor in the town, and die prematurely in an automobile accident. Perhaps this story told itself to Miss Hurston because writing it was a way to rid herself of her ambivalent feelings toward her father. From the beginning of Zora's life, her father had favored her older sister  Sarah and had predicted a dire future for Zora; he had not allowed her to carry out her mother's dying wishes; he had married  a woman whom she and her siblings hated. When Miss Hurston,  the Barnard graduate, was told of her father's death, she could  say objectively, "With my mother gone and nobody to guide  him, life had not hurt him, but it had turned him loose to hurt  himself."  The story of Jonah's Gourd Vine, then, is of a young bastard  son born into a poor family in cotton country who courts a young  girl on the right side of the creek. The trials of even the most  intelligent, energetic, and handsome of young blacks in the South  are evident. However, the couple prosper for a while when they  help to settle Eatonville, and John's industry as a carpenter and  his magnetism as a preacher make them prominent in the town.  But John is unable to resist the charms of other women. When  one entices him through Hoodoo, the neglected Lucy dies, deliberately, it seems to John. The other woman, again with the 	asu06600000210008001							66303128 Bytes	3843	5749	314021359	RGB	8	600	asu06600000210008001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1392	1392	1393.jp2	/asu0660/image/1393.jp2
Zora Neale Hurston					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000021	aid of An' Dangie Dowie the Hoodoo woman, forces John to  marry her. As a result John loses his power in Eatonville, where  he can no longer earn a living as a carpenter. He flees to Plant  City, where he meets a wealthy widow who buys him a Cadillac  which allows him to return to Eatonville to impress his former  parishoners. But while he is there, he dallies with a young girl  for most of his last night and dies in an automobile crash because he is too sleepy to drive home. At the funeral service, his  friends beat upon O-go-doe, the ancient drum—"O-go-doe, the  voice of Death—that promises nothing, that speaks with tears  only, and of the past." The final eulogy is spoken: "He wuz uh  man, and nobody knowed him but God."  Much of Jonah's Gourd Vine is devoted to Miss Hurston's  philosophy. Her frequently-repeated phrase, "Ah ain't got to  do but two things—stay black and die," appears here for the  first time. The relationship between blacks and whites is explicit, as in this exchange between two Negroes:  "What the news?"  "Oh the white folks is still in the lead."  But the no less desperate struggle among the members of the  Negro race, with envy impelling mass man of whatever race to  destroy the man on top, is a dominant theme of this first novel,  as well as her other works of fiction. Many of the superstitions,  games, songs, mores of the Florida Negro are repeated here.  Such customs as feeding sheep shadney—tea made from sheep  droppings—to infants who seem too weak to survive are recounted. (This seems only a little more horrifying than putting woodlice around the infants' necks to help them cut their  first teeth—a practice mentioned in Miss Hurston's autobiography. ) The picture of Negro life in Florida is full and rich in  this novel. The New York Times reviewer praised especially  "the excellent rendition of Negro dialect":  Unlike the dialect in most novels about the American Negro,  this does not seem to be merely the speech of white man with  the spelling distorted. Its essence lies rather in the rhythm and  balance of the sentences, in the warm artlessness of the phrasing.  The exceptional praise for a first novel by the Times indicates  the general critical acclaim received by Jonah's Gourd Vine.  7  • 	asu06600000210009001							66289128 Bytes	3863	5718	1946759220	RGB	8	600	asu06600000210009001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1393	1393	1394.jp2	/asu0660/image/1394.jp2
Zora Neale Hurston					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000021	With the publication of Mules and Men in 1935, Miss Hurston renewed her interest in Hoodoo, returning to New York  to apply for a Guggenheim fellowship to finance research in  Haiti. Once in Haiti, however, she took seven weeks from that  research to write a novel, one that she claimed had been dammed  up inside her. Their Eyes Were Watching God was written as  she fled from a stormy love affair that threated to overwhelm  her.6 And the story is, from beginning to end, a love story of  Janie, a romantic, sixteen-year-old quadroon, who dreams of  marriage:  She was stretched out on her back beneath the pear tree soaking  in the alto chant of the visiting bees, the gold of the sun and  the panting breath of the breeze when the inaudible voice of it  all came to her. She saw a dust-bearing bee sink into the sanctum of a bloom; the thousand sister-calyxes arch to meet the  love embrace and the ecstatic shiver of the tree from root to tiniest branch creaming in every blossom and frothing with delight.  So this was a marriage! She had been summoned to behold a  revelation. Then Janie felt a pain remorseless sweet that left her  limp and languid.7  This bit of pathetic fallacy characterizes Janie's dreams and at  the same time contrasts brutally with the events of her life.  Her grandmother, assuring her that love comes with marriage,  gives her to a farmer, middle-aged, dirty, unloving, who assigns  her increasing amounts of farm work. Before a year is up, she  runs off with Joe Starks, on his way from Georgia to Eatonville.  Joe provides the leadership the people of the town have been  looking for, as he buys land, installs a street light, builds a general store, and is elected mayor. Janie, working long hours in  the general store and neglected by her husband, considers fleeing  down a country road again, but she realizes that she is thirty-  five — twice as old as last time. She determines to pretend that  Joe is everything she wants. But one day during an argument  in the store before many townspeople, her frustration impels  her to strike such a humiliating blow at his manhood that he  never recovers. When he dies soon afterward, Janie gives him a  funeral that is "the finest thing Orange County had ever seen  with Negro eyes" and returns to run the store.

When a  hurricane—graphically described in the book—drives them to  Palm Beach, Tea Cup is bitten by a rabid dog while protecting  Janie, develops tetanus, and forces her to shoot him in his  madness.  Although this novel is written about many of the same people  and places that appear in Jonah's Gourd Vine, Miss Hurston's  more poetic style, her fuller development of character, and her  greater gift for description of setting all reveal a writer of increasing power. Many of the themes match those of Jonah's  Gourd Vine, as well. The struggle for position among blacks  is demonstrated by the high-yellow barkeeper who wants to restrict her place to lighter blacks. The struggle between whites and  blacks appears after the hurricane when the skin color of each  corpse must be determined because whites, however unidentifiable, are placed in separate coffins, while blacks are thrown  into a common burial hole. And the struggle of the Negro  woman, perhaps the most desperate of all, is experienced by  Janie and described by her grandmother:  "Honey, de white man is de ruler of everything as far as Ah  been able to find out . . . So de white man throw down de load  and tell de nigger man tuh pick it up. He pick it up because he  have to, but he don't tote it. He hand it to him womenfolks. De  nigger woman is de mule of the world so far as Ah can see. Ah  been prayin' fuh it tuh be different wid you. Lawd, Lawd,  Lawd!"8  These struggles are balanced by scenes of high comedy, such as  the funeral service of the town's favorite donkey with its parody  of many religious rites. As always in Miss Hurston's works,  dialect adds its lighter moments. Teacup, eating Janie's mulatto  rice, says, "Gal, it's too good! You switches a mean fanny  around in a kitchen." And Janie's disdain for gossipers is expressed in equally colorful language: "If God don't think no mo'  'bout them then Ah do, they's a lost ball in de high grass." All  the elements add up to what the New York Times critic called  "a well-nigh perfect story."  That second novel completed, Miss Hurston worked on research for her authoritative book on Hoodoo, Tell My Horse, 	asu06600000210011001							66860976 Bytes	3895	5720	2387715437	RGB	8	600	asu06600000210011001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1395	1395	1396.jp2	/asu0660/image/1396.jp2
Zora Neale Hurston					Helmick, Evelyn Thomas																											asu0660000021	published in England as Voodoo Gods: An Inquiry Into Native  Myths and Magic in J arnica and Haiti. (She spells the word with  a V throughout this book.) Part I includes five essays on Jamaica, most of them centering about problems of color and racial lines. She describes the Jamaican practice of claiming percentage of white blood of one's father while ignoring the existence of a black mother. But, then, she says, the situation is  improving, and we must allow time. After all, "Some Americans  are still aping the English as best they can even though they have  had one hundred and fifty years in which to recover." Another  essay is a discussion of the superstitions of Jamaica, in which  Miss Hurston maintains a remarkable tone. She tells of Brother  Hnansi, the Spider, a culture hero who is personated in Haiti  by Ti Malice and in the United States by Brer Rabbit. One fascination is with duppies, those Spirits who live in trees. Without  condescension, Miss Hurston discusses one man who "had a  covenant with a tree on the sunny side." She tells of the preparation of the young Jamaican girl for marriage and of the place  of woman in a society in which her only function is to afford  pleasure to a man who can divorce her simply by returning her to  her parents. Of a woman in the Caribbean she writes:  If she is of no particular family, poor and black, she is in  a bad way indeed in that man's world. She had better pray to  the Lord to turn her into a donkey and be done with the thing.  It is assumed that God made poor black females for beasts of  burden, and nobody is going to interfere with providence.9  Part II of Tell My Horse is a series of essays on the troubled  political climate of Haiti, so apparent even thirty-five years ago.  Miss Hurston sees the problem in perspective: "In the past, as  now, Haiti's curse has been her politicians." Here is the first indication of the preoccupation with politics which would become  so passionate in her later years.  Part III delves into the study of Haitian Voodoo, again with  a tone both sympathetic and objective. At the same time that  Miss Hurston shows a feeling for and understanding of Voodoo  gods, she can compare their worship with that of Greek, Roman,  and Scandinavian gods. She gives a very explicit explanation of  the sexual basis of all Voodoo belief. The important three-legged  horse, for example, is a survival of an African puberty rite for  •   10 	asu06600000210012001							65344744 Bytes	3822	5697	2458488006	RGB	8	600	asu06600000210012001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1396	1396	1397.jp2	/asu0660/image/1397.jp2

Miss Hurston was allowed to  touch and even photograph an authentic zombie: "I know that  there are Zombies in Haiti. People have been called back from  the dead." Her final judgment on Voodoo is found in her autobiography. Voodoo is as valid as any religion that satisfies, she  says.  If science ever gets to the bottom of Voodoo in Haiti and Africa,  it will be found that some important medical secrets, still unknown to medical science, give it its power rather than the gestures of ceremony.10  The appendix to Tell My Horse prints some fascinating songs  of worship to Voodoo gods. This book and Mules and Men have  caused Miss Hurston's work to be called definitive in the field  of Voodoo.  The months in her life after the completion of Tell My Horse  are not very well documented. She returned to New York, went  South for several months, then back to New York to resume her  love affair with a man identified only as A.W.P. During this  interval she was undoubtedly working on her next novel, Moses,  Man of the Mountain, but strangely she does not mention that  book anywhere in her autobiography. Moses is the story of  Egyptian oppression of the Hebrews told in modern Negro dialect, making clear a number of parallels. The dominating one  is between Moses — the serpent god — and the most powerful  god in any Negro culture. Miss Hurston indicates the widespread worship of Moses in an introduction and makes the identification stronger when he is called in the book "the finest Hoodoo man in the world." In the scenes in which Moses demonstrates his magic techniques, or climbs to a mountain top obscured by clouds, or casts hypnotic spells, he is truly a shaman-  istic figure. Many of the incidents point up Miss Hurston's own  view of religion, a rather ambiguous judgment, finally. Moses,  as a witch-doctor, is admirable in his strength and his devotion  to his people, but he is impatient with the knowledge without  wisdom of the priests. He has learned all their lore until  he knew all that there was to be known and still he found no  doors that either hinged on hell nor heaven. He called the names  a thousand times, but he saw no faces of gods. But he learned  11   • 	asu06600000210013001							66816632 Bytes	3904	5703	4211501538	RGB	8	600	asu06600000210013001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1397	1397	1398.jp2	/asu0660/image/1398.jp2

In  this he saw a certain mastery over people if one cared to use it  or needed to use it.11  The power struggles between Moses and Aaron reveal the conflict between the divinely inspired prophet and power-seeking  priest. One of the few departures in plot from the story of Exodus  is the killing of Aaron by Moses on the mountain top, a signal  of the power of the witch-doctor, the man of strength.  If Miss Hurston's device of identifying the Israelite with the  Negro shows the the universality of religious ideas, it also  provides for minute details, many of them made humorous  by the Negro dialect. Moses finds, for example, "a little tee-  nincy voice raised up in the back of his mind." A festival  becomes "a big clothes-putting-on and eating down the road  a piece." When Moses rids his father-in-law's land of unwelcome relatives by raining frogs, Jethro sends them a letter  suggesting that Moses' greatest magic may have been stopping  them from eating somebody else's groceries. But that may be  wrong, he adds. "Have you ever seen his sendings of snakes  and lice?" Miss Hurston's version of the Moses legend, then,  is a combination of primitive, almost childish, superstition and  magic with a great spiritual experience. The final tone, however,  is poetic and rather majestic, and it suggests the need of a god  of force by any people struggling to maintain their humanity in  the face of slavery of any kind. Moses thinks as he looks over  the tents of Israel that he had meant to make a people  free and just, noble and strong ... He had found out that no  man may make another free. Freedom was something internal.  The outside signs were just signs and symbols of the man inside.  All you could do was to give the opportunity for freedom and  the man himself must make his own emancipation. He remembered how often he had had to fight Israel to halt a return to  Egypt and slavery. Responsibility had seemed too awful to them  time and time again. They had wanted to kill him several times  for forcing them to be men. Only their awe and terror of his  powers had saved his life.12  That force is necessary to religion is a conclusion she reaches  again in the chapter on religion in her autobiography. Con-  stantine, she says, "as pagan as he could lay in his hide," became  after his vision a power for Christianity.

The anthropologist is at work in all of Miss Hurston's discussions of religion.  Her next book was her autobiography, Dust Tracks on a  Road, published in 1942. She had gone to California the year  before to visit friends and relax. Instead, she worked for Paramount Studios and began her new book, which would win the  Anisfield Award for its contribution to better race relations.  Dust Tracks on a Road is a very informal narrative about the  people and places which form the background of Miss Hurston's  fife. The most prominent figure is her father, whose attitude  toward young Zora Neale seems consistent from the moment he  threatened to cut his throat when he heard the news that he had  a second daughter. (The threat is presented as hearsay, not  fact, but squares with the father-daughter relationship that maintained until he died.) Miss Hurston says, "Let me change words  with him—and I am of the word-changing kind—and he was  ready to change ends." Fortunately her mother was gentle, loving, and in her own way stronger than her husband. Lucy managed to save the child from the father's anger until her death  when John Hurston's new wife persuaded him to banish all  the children from the house. This incident must have obsessed  Miss Hurston throughout her life; her frequent mention of it is  notable even in a book so generally unstructured. The scandalous  second marriage is prominent in Jonah's Gourd Vine, that biographical novel which is perhaps an attempt at exorcism of the  spectre of her father's dislike and her own hatred of his second  wife.  The second half of Dust Tracks is brighter, as Zora Neale  finds delight in reading, studying, and finally writing her own  books. Her success came partly through her own enterprise,  partly through the remarkable number of influential people who  helped her. When she had attained her Barnard degree and been  given her research assignment, she could finally talk of a happy  interval which produced a "glowing aura." That glow makes  itself felt often in this book. The section on her research in  Florida, for example, turns into a spirited, Whitmanesque celebration of the workers of Polk County.  13  • 	asu06600000210015001							66601996 Bytes	3861	5748	2048126706	RGB	8	600	asu06600000210015001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1399	1399	1400.jp2	/asu0660/image/1400.jp2

Sweating black bodies, muscled like gods,  working to feed the hunger of the great tooth. Polk County!13  Other chapters in this second half include a discussion of love  and the men in her life; an examination of religion, both the  evangelism of her childhood and the anthropological views of  her adult years; an appreciation of two women important to  her—Fanny Hurst and Ethel Waters. Perhaps most significant,  at least in terms of the Anisfield Award, is the chapter entitled  "My People! My People!" in which Miss Hurston catalogs many  of the traits of her race she has written about in her novels:  the class consciousness within the race, the rivalries of women  fighting over men, the Negro's ambiguous evaluation of himself. But she is proud to be Negro: "Consider that with tolerance  and patience, we godly demons may breed a noble world in a  few hundred generations or so."  This book is filled with the candor that marks all of Miss  Hurston's work. Her sister Sarah, she writes, "was struggling  along with a husband for whom we all wished a short sickness  and a quick funeral." She could say of her father: "Old Maker  had left out the steering gear when He gave Papa his talents."  The autobiography well earned its praise from the New York  Times as being "saucy, defiant, high-pressure. . . as vivid as  jasmine and as vulgar as a well-liquored fish-fry."  Miss Hurston completed one more book, a novel of social  realism with Freudian overtones entitled Seraph On the Suwanee.  It is the story of Arvay Henson, who, five years past the marrying age of girls in town, thinks she loves her older sister's minister  husband, one reason she has denounced the joys of the world  and plans to become a missionary. But when Jim Meserve, a  handsome young man of a higher class than these poor whites  of Sawley, appears and decides he wants Arvay as his wife, she  learns to respond to his love after a period of uncertainty and a  few attacks of hysteria. Their marriage is fulfilling, but Arvay's  sense of her inferiority combined with self-pity erodes the relationship through the years. She is also too emotionally attached  to her first-born retarded son who threatens the lives and security  •   14 	asu06600000210016001							68013168 Bytes	3929	5768	127061495	RGB	8	600	asu06600000210016001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1400	1400	1401.jp2	/asu0660/image/1401.jp2

Jim, who has been successful in the  lumber and shrimp businesses, decides to leave her and live  aboard one of his boats. After a dramatic incident during which  she unable to help free him from a snake threatening to crush  him, Arvay comes eventually to an understanding of her own  worth through a conflict with her sister's family in her childhood home after their mother's death. With a new awareness  and self-valuation she returns to her husband and a renewal of  their love.  Much of the novel is devoted to the exploration of the meaning of love. And the relationship between Arvay and Jim is  tender and strong, sexual and alive, revealed in vigorous dialog  and carefully chosen symbols. Another theme, but subordinate  here, deals with racial attitudes. The strongest of friendships are  between Jim and a Negro friend who saves his life and Jim and  a Portuguese fisherman who builds his fleet. Arvay cannot accept  these men and their wives as her equals; her world, in fact, is so  closed that she objects to her daughter's marriage to a Yankee.  Miss Hurston shows the vitality in the lines of the minority  groups, perhaps epitomized in the words of a black man to a  white: "If you ever was to be a Negro just one Saturday night,  you'd never want to be white no more." The author knew that  her powers as a novelist were maturing during these years; the  complexity and beauty of Seraph On The Suwanee justifies her  confidence.  Although she published no more books after this novel of  1948, the later years were filled with activity of an almost incredible variety. She taught creative writing at Florida Memorial  College in St. Augustine, where she met Marjory Kinnan Rawl-  ings, who was to become a close friend. (She had taught before,  or had at least held a post as Chairman of the drama department at North Carolina College for Negroes, but the dates coincide with years she was in the field in Haiti.) She wrote radio  scripts for her own sustaining program in Cincinnati. She lived  on a houseboat in Daytona Beach for a while, but when her  restless spirit rebelled, she sold the boat to finance a mysterious  expedition to Honduras. When she returned she was without  funds; so she went to work as a maid in a Miami Beach house-  15  • 	asu06600000210017001							68060172 Bytes	3921	5784	3677799969	RGB	8	600	asu06600000210017001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1401	1401	1402.jp2	/asu0660/image/1402.jp2

That job ended when her employers discovered an article  written by her in a current issue of The Saturday Evening Post;  it was impossible to employ as a maid one of the few Negroes  listed in Who's Who. She then lived on a fishing boat for several  months, waiting for the owner to sail back to Honduras. Learning that he had no intention of leaving Florida, she moved into  the Miami home of Judge Frank Smathers to help him write his  autobiography. She served as librarian at Patrick Air Force Base  in 1956 and 1957, but was fired for "being too well educated for  the job." The last two years of her life were meagerly supported  by her substitute teaching in Fort Pierce.14  Two interests gave her life coherence during these frantic  years. One was politics, which became almost a passion. Miss  Hurston made many radio speeches and public appearances in  support of her favorite candidates, but never adhered to a party  line. The highlight of her political activity was an outspoken  article in The Saturday Evening Post entitled "A Negro Voter  Sizes Up Taft," in which she coined the phrase "Mr. Republican." Her second interest was her old love, writing. She was  producing articles and stories for American Mercury, The Saturday Evening Post, and other prominent periodicals. And through  all of this period, she was researching and writing what she expected to be her most important book, a life of Herod the Great.  In 1955 she was two-thirds finished and had such great hopes  that she invited Winston Churchill to write a running comment  on the political implications of each chapter. But she suffered  a stroke before she could complete her work and died a year  later on January 28, 1960, having spent the last months of her  life in the St. Lucie welfare home.  She left memories of a strong, colorful woman with an immense capacity for affection. Langston Hughes remembered her  as the most amusing member of the literary members of the  Negro Renaissance—the "niggerati," they called themselves.  "Only to reach a wider audience, need she ever write books—  because she is a perfect book of entertainment in herself." She  seemed to know everyone in New York, he says, so many of  them close friends that she was able to move into an unfurnished  apartment at a time when she had no money (those times were  •   16 	asu06600000210018001							67082340 Bytes	3897	5736	3754121346	RGB	8	600	asu06600000210018001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1402	1402	1403.jp2	/asu0660/image/1403.jp2

But Pratt  was angry because of a mild altercation. Miss Hurston had  written him from Miami to say that she had no money but did  have an offer of a job in New York if she could pay her fare.  When she remained in Miami after he and other friends sent  her money, he wrote to her, he says, to scold her. He was astounded at her response:  She wrote back that she had read, just at that time, that I was  going through the trying process of having a book published.  Because of this she understood why I was being so testy, and  she forgave me for being put out with her.16  Even in periods of bad fortune, she remained the spirited Zora  Neale of Eatonville. Her appearance was flamboyant as well:  in 1942 Current Biography wrote of her: "Strikingly attractive,  she wears exotic clothing and affects bizarre jewelry." She was  the personification of her own ideal: "I love courage in any  form. I worship strength."  Yet she could be quite humble when the feelings of her friends  were involved. Norton Baskin recalls Miss Hurston's visit to his  late wife, Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, at their apartment in his  hotel. Knowing the racial climate of St. Augustine in the forties,  they were apprehensive of the reception she might get from the  townspeople and hotel guests, so Mr. Baskin warned his help  and waited at the door to greet Miss Hurston. When she did not  arrive, he called his wife to say he was sorry she had been stood  up and was told that their friend was there and he should join  the fun. Miss Hurston, realizing the possibility of embarrassment  to her white friends, had entered through the kitchen door and  climbed the back stairs. Pratt tells a similar story of her consideration of him and his wife.  Because her vibrant personality animates everything she wrote,  there are no stereotypes in her books, as there were none in her  life. She rejected the kind of writing that was being done by  other members of her race:  I saw that what was being written and declaimed was a pose.  17 • 	asu06600000210019001							66113788 Bytes	3840	5737	4020699168	RGB	8	600	asu06600000210019001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1403	1403	1404.jp2	/asu0660/image/1404.jp2

It has such a definite pattern as to become approximately folklore. So I made up my mind to write about my people as they  are, and not to use the traditional lay figures.17  Thus she reveals her people in their infinite variety. And her  readers know that her own variety is no less infinite. When we  encounter the listing in Who's Who of her religious preference  as "pagan," for example, we know from her work that she really  believed in Hoodoo, she really believed in the religion of Moses,  and she really believed in the Baptist evangelism of her father's  preaching. Her soul was large enough to embrace them all.  NOTES  1 Various sources give conflicting dates for the year of her birth  —1901, 1903, 1907, 1908.

Nick Adams, Prince of Abissinia					Skipp, Francis E.																											asu0660000021	Nick Adams, Prince of Abissinia  Francis E. Skipp*  When Fanny Burney visited Samuel Johnson in Bolt  Court less than a month before he died, she found  him desperately sick in body but undiminished in  the vigor of his mind. In the conversation she set down in her  diary we find Johnson saying, "Genius is nothing more than  knowing the use of tools; but there must be tools for it to use:  a man who has spent all his life in this room will give a poor  account of what is contained in the next."1  Here, at the end of his life, Johnson is saying once more what  he had said so often during his literary career, that all knowledge  of this world comes through the senses and that experience must  precede the formulation of philosophy. Such an assumption is  the foundation of his tale, Rasselas Prince of Abissinia, for the  young prince makes a "choice of life" only after experience has  shown the alternatives.  Today Rasselas is little read and this seems a pity, for it discloses how little different is the record of human experience in  two ages seemingly so unlike as the Age of Johnson and our  own. Just how close this correspondence might be is suggested  by parallels between Rasselas and the stories and novels of  Ernest Hemingway whose characters made a "choice of life"  which became the life style for a segment of at least one generation in our time.  Rasselas, Prince of the royal family of Abissinia, was born,  we recall, in Happy Valley and lived there to young manhood  isolated from the world. When boredom and a yearning to extend  his horizons beyond the overhanging mountains moved him to  escape, he broke with the tradition of his country and defied  the authority of his parents. His young years, he said, had "been  lost by the crime and folly of my ancestors and the absurd institutions of my country."2  *Dr. Skipp is an associate professor of English at the University of Miami.

Nick Adams, Prince of Abissinia					Skipp, Francis E.																											asu0660000021	In the prince's realization of lost time and his decision to  escape, the tale looks forward to Hemingway's stories of the  young Nick Adams on the road. Just what drove the boy Nick  from the comfortable home of his doctor father, Hemingway  has never made entirely clear. Of that period in his life Nick  himself said, "It was a good story but there were still too many  people alive for him to write it."3 Nevertheless, Nick did break  away from a home where his mother read Science and Health  and pronounced platitudes and where his father was prudish  about sex. We see the boy riding the freights, eating with punch-  drunk psychotics, working behind a short-order counter, bantering with whores, all in quiet but firm defiance of traditional patterns of behavior and all in defiance (for so we must surmise)  of his parents' wishes.4  Perhaps the adventures of the young Prince Rasselas were  equally picturesque, but Johnson does not amuse us with their  particulars. He tells us, however, that before the Prince left the  valley the young man's chief amusement was  to picture to himself that world which he had never seen; to  place himself in various conditions; to be entangled in imaginary difficulties, and to be engaged in wild adventures: but his  benevolence always terminated in the relief of distress, the  detection of fraud, the defeat of oppression, and the diffusion  of happiness. ... He busied himself so intensely in visionary  bustle, that he . . . neglected to consider by what means he  should mingle with mankind [p. 21].  Rasselas, Prince of the royal family of Abissinia, was born,  we soon see the illusions that preceded experience give way to  sophistication. Until he went into the world, however, those  day-dreams of his were like Robert Cohn's fantasies of South  America, imagined from the distance of the Paris of The Sun  Also Rises. Jake Barnes, the novel's narrator-hero, tells the  reader that Cohn had "read and reread The Purple Land,'"  which Barnes calls "a very sinister book if read too late in life.  It recounts the splendid imaginary adventures of a perfect English gentleman in an intensely romantic land."5  3"Fathers and Sons" in The Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway (New York, 1938),  p. 491.

Nick Adams, Prince of Abissinia					Skipp, Francis E.																											asu0660000021	Like Rasselas, Cohn regretted the lost years of his life. He  asked Jake, "Don't you ever get the feeling your life is going by  and you're not taking advantage of it?" (p. 11). But Rasselas,  unlike Cohn, came to understand through the instruction of the  wise poet, Imlac, that "long journies in search of truth are not  commanded. Truth such as is necessary to the regulation of life,  is always found where it is honestly sought. Change of place is  no natural cause of the increase of piety, for it inevitably produces dissipation of the mind" (pp. 54-55). Robert Cohn, on  the other hand, is not so apt a pupil, resisting the truth of Jake  Barnes's assertion that "Going to another country doesn't make  any difference. I've tried all that. You can't get away from yourself by moving from one place to another. ... If you went there  the way you feel now it would be exactly the same" (p. 11).  And when the poet Imlac, upbraiding Rasselas for philosophizing at too great length, declared "It seems to me . . . that while  you are making a choice of life you neglect to live" (p. 135),  we recall Jake's penultimate remarks on this subject to Cohn:  "This is a good town. Why don't you start living your life in  Paris?" (p. 11).  In Rasselas' journey into experience, Imlac's practical knowledge of affairs introduces the prince into those circumstances  and adventures from which he is able to deduce a philosophy.  When Rasselas' deductions seem amiss, Imlac undertakes to  correct them. Imlac, in this respect, functions in the same way  as a number of tutor-like figures in Hemingway's stories and  novels. Such a figure might be the Italian major of "In Another  Country" teaching Nick Adams the meaning of love and human  dignity in an absurd world. He might be Pedro Romero in the  Pamplona bull ring teaching Jake Barnes the meaning of grace  under pressure. He might be Robert Wilson on the Serengetti  Plain teaching Francis Macomber the meaning of courage,  honor, and responsibility. Whatever his name, he helps the  Hemingway hero to find his way through the Hemingway world.  Such, of course, is the function of Imlac in the world of Samuel  Johnson's imagining.  In his quest for truth in that world, Rasselas is accompanied  by his sister Nekayah. She adopts his pragmatic approach to  • 22 	asu06600000210024001							67085684 Bytes	3897	5736	2919544026	RGB	8	600	asu06600000210024001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1408	1408	1409.jp2	/asu0660/image/1409.jp2

Together they pool the data of their  experiences and together they assess its significance. One such  experience involves Nekayah's favorite, the young woman Pe-  kuah, whose superstitious fear of entering one of the pyramids  in the Egyptian desert amounts to mortal terror. Nekayah, therefore, does not insist that the girl accompany their party and  humors the girl's ardent wish to return to the tent in the desert.  Desert marauders kidnap the unprotected girl, and a moral  question arises: to what extent is Nekayah responsible for the  abduction? Imlac points out that had Nekayah compelled the  girl to enter the pyramid and the girl had died of terror, surely  she would have been responsible for the girl's death. And had  she compelled her to return to the tent, as surely would she  have been responsible for her abduction. Nekayah, however,  feels no guilty pangs. Seeking the reason why she bears her responsibility so easily, she perceives that she has acted out of  benevolence and generosity, permissively and not authoritatively.  Through following the guidance of her feelings, Nekayah is able  to conclude that "no evil is insupportable but that which is accompanied by a consciousness of wrong" (p. 153).  It is a very short step from this notion that one is guilty of  evil only when emotionally conscious of having done wrong to  Nick Adams' own position. His creator, Ernest Hemingway, has  declared, "So far, about morals, I only know that what is moral  is what you feel good after and what is immoral is what you feel  bad after."6 Morality, when it is defined by such pragmatic  criteria, is necesarily an individual's morality. Nekayah's "consciousness of wrong" or Ernest Hemingway's "bad" feeling are  scarcely universal moral standards. Nekayah says, "We are not  now inquiring for the world but for ourselves" (p. 128). Her  words suggest those of Jake Barnes when he says, "Perhaps as  you went along you did learn something. I did not care what it  was all about. All I wanted to know was how to live in it"  (p. 148). Jake, like Nekayah, here modestly disclaims even the  likelihood that experience will lead him to the formulation of  universal moral principles. Evaluating each new experience according to how he feels afterwards he inquires for himself and  23 • 	asu06600000210025001							65730476 Bytes	3854	5683	3894449170	RGB	8	600	asu06600000210025001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1409	1409	1410.jp2	/asu0660/image/1410.jp2
Nick Adams, Prince of Abissinia					Skipp, Francis E.																											asu0660000021	is grateful for knowledge of the world that does no more than  show him "how to live in it."  After inquiring for herself through a succession of episodes  Nekayah is able at least to generalize about ways in which morality seems to function in our world. "We do not," she says, "always find visible happiness in proportion to visible virtue. All  natural, and almost all political, evils are incident alike to the  bad and good. . . . All . . . virtue can afford [is to] enable us to  endure calamity with patience, but remember that patience must  suppose pain" (p. 123). And although Rasselas objects that her  sentiments are exaggerations, his own experience comes to  confirm her outlook. He accepts her statement when Pekuah is  recovered that "Misfortunes . . . should always be expected. . . .  But the angels of affliction spread their toils alike for the virtuous  and the wicked and the mighty and the mean" (p. 167).  Frederic Henry of A Farewell to Arms is an ambulance driver  on the Italian front during the First World War. As a pragmatic  moralist of the Twentieth Century he came to generalize on life  in terms differing from those Samuel Johnson caused Nekayah  to express only in the intensity of the pessimism, a pessimism  that seems the natural correlative of a long and murderous war  of attrition. Reflecting on the quiet courage of his young love,  Catherine Barkley, who is dying in childbirth, he thinks, "The  world breaks every one and afterward many are strong at the  broken places. But those that will not break it kills. It kills the  very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If  you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but  there will be no special hurry."7 Like Nekayah, Frederic Henry  has found that "all natural evils . . . are incident alike to the  bad and good," and confirms her observation that "the angels  of affliction spread their toils alike for the virtuous and the wicked." And if Frederic Henry found some bitter comfort in learning  about strength at the broken places, Imlac, too, had observed,  concerning psychological damage, that "while the vital powers  remain uninjured nature will find a means of reparation"  (p. 157).  6Death in the Afternoon (New York, 1932), p. 4.  7A Farewell to Arms (New York, 1929), pp. 258-259.

Nick Adams, Prince of Abissinia					Skipp, Francis E.																											asu0660000021	There is little comfort in such assurances, however, for Rasselas, Nekayah, and Pekuah. Their long quest in search of happiness only came to teach them what Imlac had known all along,  that "human life everywhere is a state where much is to be  endured and little to be enjoyed" (p. 57), and the irony of  human experience which by and large finds its present condition  miserable "yet when the same state is again at a distance, imagination paints it as desirable" (p. 98). Jake Barnes, as thoroughly  disillusioned as they, was saying the same thing a bit more tersely  in the last line of The Sun Also Rises. To Brett Ashley's desperate assertion that had the circumstances of their lives been different they "could have had such a damned good time together,"  he replied sardonically, "Isn't it pretty to think so?" (p. 247).  Rasselas, Nekayah, and Pekuah resolve at last to return to  Happy Valley. They had found no self-justifying activity and  their only alternative, as Joseph Wood Krutch put it, was to fill  up their life "with those temporary satisfactions which are gained by the gratification of the easily wearied senses and the parallel gratification of the less easily wearied but still far from limitless appetite for knowledge to which he [Johnson] generally  gives no more exalted name than curiosity."8  The world, then, as experience revealed it to them, was essentially the world the Hemingway hero was to discover, a world  of "secular hurryings through space," as Bertrand Russell somewhere describes it. It is the Hemingway world of nada, a world  with nothing at its center. Rasselas ends with a "conclusion in  which nothing is concluded," and each of the pilgrims comes to  the realization that "of these wishes that they had formed they  well knew that none could be obtained" (p. 221). This, perhaps,  is Johnson's generality for which Hemingway supplied a particular metaphor. While Catherine Barkley lay dying, Frederic  Henry in the street outside the hospital, came upon a dog nosing  at a refuse can and described the encounter in these words:  " 'What do you want,' I asked and looked into the can to see if  there was anything I could pull out for him; there was nothing on  top but coffee grounds, dust, and some dead flowers. There isn't  anything, dog,' I said" (p. 32).

Nick Adams, Prince of Abissinia					Skipp, Francis E.																											asu0660000021	I would be misleading to suggest through the marshalling of  parallel moral philosophies that in world outlook Ernest Hemingway and Samuel Johnson differ only in diction and fictional  mode. Hemingway suffuses his picture of the unsatisfactory world  with passion and bitterness. He occupies a position very close  to his suffering heroes whose involvement in terror and violence  makes impossible a quiet, reasonable pessimism. Johnson, on the  other hand, is with the spectator, keeping a cool and distant view  of his disappointed characters and thereby suggesting a positive  code: live calmly, reasonably. The human experiences they  record, however, are essentially similar, their empirical episte-  mology the same, their subjective reference in moral judgments  much alike. It follows naturally, therefore, that the world of  Johnson's Rasselas, bereft as it is of ultimate and abiding values,  should mirror Hemingway's world of nada.  26 	asu06600000210028001							66202740 Bytes	3873	5696	2766454583	RGB	8	600	asu06600000210028001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1412	1412	1413.jp2	/asu0660/image/1413.jp2
Injustice in Measure for Measure					Babula, William																											asu0660000021	JUSTICE   IN  Measure for Measure  William Babula*  This paper begins with an assumption: the end of Measure for Measure is its beginning. Shakespeare sensed  a degree of injustice in the conventional tragicomic  conclusion and decided to use that injustice for his own dramatic  ends. In this sense, the ending of Measure for Measure generated  the drama. Part of that tragicomic resolution follows in the  words of the Duke:  By this Lord Angelo perceives he's safe;  Methinks I see a quickening in his eye.  Well, Angelo your evil quits you well:  Look that you love your wife; her worth worth yours.  I find an apt remission in myself;  And yet here's one in place I cannot pardon.1  The "one" to whom the Duke refers is Lucio. In following lines  the nature of his punishment is made explicit by the Duke:  As I have heard him swear himself there's one  Whom he begot with child, let her appear,  And he shall marry her: the nuptial finish'd,  Let him be whipt and hang'd. (v, i, 516-519)  While this sentence is ameliorated, the Duke's commands sound  harsh to the ear of the audience: ". . . Take him to prision;/And  see our pleasure herein executed" (v, i, 526-527). Lucio himself is hardly relieved by the sentence to marry a "punk" which  he says is "pressing to death, whipping, and hanging."  Lucio's plight would be comic if it were not for Angelo. Instead of comedy, however, Shakespeare presents to his audience  an action that is the image of injustice. "Let him be whipt and  hang'd," applied to Lucio, reminds us of everything that Angelo  avoids. If the scene is meant to arouse our sense of mercy, Shakespeare appears to undermine his own purpose. Mercy, however,  may be little to the dramatic point. It may be that the conclusion  to Measure for Measure is a consciously contrived injustice.  As such, it simply emphasizes the effect produced by many  *Dr. Babula is an assistant professor of English at the University of Miami.  27   • 	asu06600000210029001							65444860 Bytes	3840	5679	2748437890	RGB	8	600	asu06600000210029001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1413	1413	1414.jp2	/asu0660/image/1414.jp2
Injustice in Measure for Measure					Babula, William																											asu0660000021	another tragicomic ending. Thus, if we begin from the premise  that the ending is meant to affect us as unjust, we find that much  of the action in the drama repeats this effect. What might be  called the Lucio-Angelo pattern recurs throughout the play.  There is no measure for measure at the end, but a conscious  injustice that seems to flow back into the structure of the entire  work. It is the injustice of the conclusion that begins the dramatic  order of Measure for Measure.  On stage, obviously, the play does not run backwards. Our  introduction to the operation of justice in Vienna coincides with  our introduction to Claudio's situation. Condemned to death for  fornication, he laments:  Thus can the demigod Authority  Make us pay down our offence by weight  The words of heaven; on whom it will, it will;  On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just. (I, ii, 124-127)  The burden of the speech is upon the injustice of "Authority";  the last begrudging "Tis just" does not convince Claudio or us.  In fact, later in the scene he argues that Angelo is punishing him  only to win a "name:"  And the new deputy now for the duke—  Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,  Or whether that the body public be  A horse whereon the governor doth ride,  Who, newly in the seat, that it may know  He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;  Whether the tyranny be in his place,  Or in his eminence that fills it up,  I stagger in. . . (I, ii, 161-169)  It is now "tyranny" that punishes him. At this early point in  the play there is no sense that justice is being done.  This rather negative theme is picked up by Angelo himself  in Act II. Unmoved by the arguments of Escalus for mercy  towards Claudio, the deputy points out that justice is rather  haphazard in its operations:  ... I do not deny,  The jury, passing on the prisoner's life,  May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two  Guiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice,  That justice seizes: what knows the laws  That thieves do pass on thieves? . . . (II, i, 18-23)  •   28 	asu06600000210030001							66109596 Bytes	3885	5670	589670869	RGB	8	600	asu06600000210030001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1414	1414	1415.jp2	/asu0660/image/1415.jp2
Injustice in Measure for Measure					Babula, William																											asu0660000021	Angelo's criticism is pointed, and it could hardly be termed a  defense of judicial process. It is an admission of that "tyranny"  of the law that Claudio claimed had condemned him. Escalus  responds with a despairing aside that refers to Claudio, but also  to the situation at the close of the play. In his comment, the  Lucio-Claudio pattern noted above is apparent:  Well, heaven forgive him! and forgive us all!  Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall:  Some run from brakes of vice, and answer none:  And some condemned for a fault alone. (II, i, 37-40)  While Lucio is hardly an innocent, compared to Angelo and  his crimes, he seems quite harmless. Injustice is becoming a  major concern of the play.  In the same scene there is a trial. Froth and Pompey are accused by the foolish Elbow of being bawds. The arguments are  comic to the audience, but tedious for the judges. Suddenly,  Angelo descends from the bench with an explicit statement of  judicial prejudice:  This will last out a night in Russia,  When nights are longest there: 111 take my leave,  And leave you to the hearing of the cause;  Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all. (II, i, 139-142)  He refuses to hear the case; he is not concerned about justice,  but annoyed by the drawn out process. It is easier to whip everyone than find out the truth. As the play develops on one level,  less and less justice is available. The audience is continually  struck by dramatic actions that mirror the conclusion of the  play. Even Escalus' mercy towards Pompey seems ambiguous.  Having heard the case without Angelo, Escalus frees Pompey  with a warning to behave. However, Pompey, in an aside, informs us he will continue in his trade despite the law. This  judicial error puts Escalus' concluding comments in an ironical  shadow. He speaks of the impending execution of Claudio:  It is needful:  Mercy is not itself, that oft looks so;  Pardon is still the nurse of second woe:  But yet,—poor Claudio! There is no remedy. (II, i, 296-299)  Though sympathetic, Escalus is resigned; Claudio must die. The  escape of Pompey, in this context, is as unjust as the escape of  29  • 	asu06600000210031001							65750344 Bytes	3841	5704	2031129069	RGB	8	600	asu06600000210031001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1415	1415	1416.jp2	/asu0660/image/1416.jp2
Injustice in Measure for Measure					Babula, William																											asu0660000021	Angelo at the tragicomic conclusion. In both cases, Shakespeare  seems to image forth a life full of unjustice. "Why me?"  Claudio can legitimately inquire.  Attempts to delay the execution bring about further statements  about the danger of injustice in the judicial process. Angelo is  warned by the Provost that judges have erred in the past:  ... I have seen,  When, after execution, judgement hath  Repented o'er his doom. (II, ii, 10-12)  His comment, however, does not deter Angelo. Isabella then  presents a series of arguments that culminate in similar asser-  tations about the unfairness of human judges. Everything depends upon "the demigod Authority" and its prejudices. As  Isabella argues in defense of her brother:  Great men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them,  But in the less foul profanation. (II, ii, 127-128)  That in the captain's but a choleric word,  Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy. (II, ii, 130-131)  Because authority, though it err like others,  Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself,  That skins the vice o' the top . . . (II, ii, 134-136)  Such reasons, however, do not reach Angelo, instead, he is  moved by Isabella herself. Lusting now for her, he recognizes  the truth of her comments when he admits, "Thieves for their  robbery have authority/When judges steal themselves" (II, ii,  176-177).  But he refuses to release Claudio. Each bit of action considered affects us as the consciously unjust conclusion to the play.  When Isabella understands Angelo's intentions, her lament is a  general comment upon justice:  . . . O perilous mouths,  That bear in them one and the self-same tongue,  Either of condemnation or approof;  Bidding the law make court'sy to their will ... (II, iv, 172-175)  Again we are presented with the injustice that seems to rule  human affairs; we should not be surprised by the conclusion that  is generating the shape of the drama.

Injustice in Measure for Measure					Babula, William																											asu0660000021	The suggestion that life is dominated by injustice is reiterated  through the comic figure Pompey. In III, ii, Pompey has been  arrested again for his activities. But he is strikingly correct in  his comments upon those who escape the law that has captured  him:  Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the merriest was  put down, and the worser allowed by order of law a furred gown  to keep him warm; and furred with fox and lamb-skins too, to  signify, that craft, being richer than innocency, stands for the  facing. (Ill, ii, 6-11)  It is another example of the Angelo-Lucio pattern that concludes  the drama. The moneylenders are able to avoid the rather blind  law while the procurers suffer.  In this unjust world, then, what is the role of the Duke? It  is easy to admit that his past lapses have created the present  situation, note his attempt to restore a proper order in the state,  and leave it at that. But he also can be criticized for certain  of his actions during the play itself. First, he appears to condone  the execution of Claudio while the audience is convinced of  its injustice. In III, i, he seems to be preparing Claudio for death  and takes no action to save him until he learns of the deputy's  perfidy. Second is his treatment of the prisoner Barnardine. The  situation is presented by Shakespeare in clear terms: it would  be damnable to execute him in the godless state he is in. It is up  to the authorities to give him an opportunity to repent his crimes.  However, there is another order to be served, a Claudio is far  more important in the Duke's scheme of things than a Barnardine. So the Duke can declare in the same breath of him:  Unfit to live or die: O gravel heart!  After him, fellows; bring him to the block. (IV, 111, 68-69)  and  A creature unprepared, unmeet for death;  And to transport him in the mind he is  Were damnable. (IV, iii, 71-73)  Yet the Duke is ready to execute him until he learns of the convenient natural death of the pirate Ragozine. There seems to  be, as Isabella suggested earlier in the play, a different set of  laws for the different classes. Injustice is forced upon our sensibilities.  31   • 	asu06600000210033001							66253012 Bytes	3856	5725	2632809475	RGB	8	600	asu06600000210033001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1417	1417	1418.jp2	/asu0660/image/1418.jp2
Injustice in Measure for Measure					Babula, William																											asu0660000021	The Duke's major unjust act in the play, however, concerns his  strange application of a double standard to Juliet and Mariana.  Claudio declared as he was led away to prison that he was indeed  married to Juliet:  . . . she is fast my wife,  Save that we do the denunciation lack  Of outward order ... (I, ii, 151-153)  They were tied by a formal betrothal that was recognized under  Elizabethan law as a valid marriage. Yet the Duke forces Juliet  to repent of her act. Urged by the disguised Duke, Juliet declares, "I do repent me, as it is an evil,/And take the shame with  joy" (II, iii, 35-36). According to this Duke, however, it is no  sin for Mariana to sleep with Angelo. He gives the very same  excuses for his substitution plot as Claudio gave for his acts  with Juliet. The Duke promises Mariana:  Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.  He is your husband on a pre-contract:  To bring you thus together, 'tis no sin,  Sith that the justice of your title to him  Doth flourish the deceit .... (IV, i, 71-75)  Something is wrong; that "demigod Authority" is at work, apparently making laws and judging sinners as it wills. The Duke's  double attitude towards Juliet and Mariana is as disturbing as  his treatment of Angelo and Lucio in the last act.  Thus as we approach Act V, we experience a dramatic world  dominated by injustice. Yet, as that act opens, we hear Isabella's  pathetic plea for "justice, justice, justice, justice!" Though aware  of the Duke and his manipulations, the prayer seems rather  hollow in the dramatic context outlined above. We are led to a  question about justice the form of which becomes crucial. "Will  she get justice?" is one question that is not really disturbing.  By now it is obvious the Duke has matters under control. On the  other hand, given the context of the drama, 'Would she get  justice?" is much more to the point. In terms of the image of life  Measure for Measure presents, this is the real question raised.  The play now concerns itself with the likelihood of justice for  a character in Isabella's position. As a dramatic experience, the  play seems to say no.

Injustice in Measure for Measure					Babula, William																											asu0660000021	the beginning of Act V, hears her complaints, his reaction is the  expected one. As a public official, he rejects her statements concerning his deputy as absurd:  By heaven, fond wretch, thou know'st not what thou speak'st,  Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour  In hateful practice. First, his integrity  Stands without blemish. Next, it imports no reason  That with such vehemency he should pursue  Faults proper to himself ... (V, i, 105-110)  The shocked Isabella responds to the realities of earthly government with a plea to the world beyond. Presumably, one will  find justice there at least. She laments:  And is this all?  Then, O you blessed ministers above,  Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd time  Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up  In countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe,  As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go! (V, i, 114-119)  On stage we have what is likely, what would happen if the play  followed part of its own logic. As injustice prevails in the conclusion, as it seems to prevail throughout the play, it prevails  in this mock-judgment. If part of Shakespeare's concern in Measure for Measure is injustice, he presents another image on stage  of that "demigod Authority" that distinguishes between "great  men" and "the less," the "captain" and the "soldier." Shakespeare  has created the probable event.  Of course the play is not over. Another judgment follows that  rescues Isabella, Mariana, and Claudio, at the same time it forgives Angelo and punishes Lucio. If this ending disturbs us, it is  part of numerous smaller effects running throughout the play.  The Angelo-Lucio pattern has dominated a goodly portion of  the dramatic action. Thus the apparent injustice of the conclusion should not come as a surprise. If we feel injustice has  been done at the conclusion of the play, we have felt the same  way throughout the play. Indeed, in the end of Measure for  Measure is the pattern that generates the play and keeps an  artistic coherence to its proliferating instances of injustice.  l Measure for Measure, V. i. 499-504.

"Sarah Simon: Character Atlantean"					Allen, Ann Andrews																											asu0660000021	"Sarah Simon:   Character Atlantean"  Ann Andrews Allen  [Mrs. Allen is the widow of the late Hervey Allen, poet, biographer and novelist, who lived in Bermuda from 1927 to  1932 during which period he wrote a book of poems and the  famous and monumental novel "Anthony Adverse." Here Mrs.  Allen discusses the 70-page poem "Sarah Simon: Character At-  lantean," the setting and inspiration for which were provided  by the Bermuda of the 1920's. Hervey Allen lived in South  Miami, Florida from the early '30s to his death in 1949. He  became a member of the Board of Trustees of the University  of Miami. Editor]  All works of the creative imagination grow from some  specific seed in the mind of the creator. In the case of  Hervey Allen's long narrative poem, Sarah Simon, the  prototype of the heroine was a woman whom I knew intimately  for five years, Dolly Latham of Somerset, Bermuda. She was  a magnificent person, whom Mr. Allen and I were fortunate  enough to have as our cook at Felicity Hall. Dolly once told Mr.  Allen of a Negro woman in the Old Ladies Home who was celebrating her hundredth birthday, a woman by the name of Sarah  Simon. Thus came the name, but in spirit and strength, the character of the poem was Dolly herself.  Hervey Allen had a definite philosophy of life. It was his ideal  that man should be self-sufficient physically as well as mentally.  For him the essence of the good life was to live on an island. He  liked the physical and spiritual isolation. It was almost a necessity for him to five near water; the sound, the surge of the tide,  the fertility and beauty as well as the sternness of the sea were  as vital to him as the air and the sun.  The richest, happiest and most fulfilling years of our life were  spent at Felicity Hall, Somerset, Bermuda. The essence of that  time is symbolized in "Sarah Simon." The poem was begun in  the second class smoking room of a Pacific Steam Navigation  Company liner while crossing the Atlantic to Spain and England;  it was completed at Tor View Cottage on Dartmoor in South  *Reprinted from The Bermudian.

"Sarah Simon: Character Atlantean"					Allen, Ann Andrews																											asu0660000021	Devon in August 1928. For some reason Mr. Allen never wrote  of a place while he was in that locality. It took time and distance  for the spirit to be distilled into literary form.  The poet was a big man in every way; and images, fancies,  creative ideas poured from him with immense vigor and vitality.  One gets the feeling of a rich, intense sub-tropical life in the  torrent of descriptive passages in this poem.  Sarah is a prototype of the child of nature. She is one to whom  the world of industry would be so alien as to be incomprehensible.  "It seemed to Sarah she was permanent,  Rooted too deep to die, and like a tree  To generations of the withering grass  Or birds within its branches. And she found  From this pervasive feeling of her soul  The way to keep on living till it seemed  As if she were the pattern of a plan  And characterized to fit a scheme of things  Longer and larger than the world about  Of men, and beasts, and tender seasonal plants  That died, and left her living by the sea.  For thus I found her."  This much is surely Dolly, a woman wise in ways of nature, of  herbs, flowers and vegetables; one who could cure any child or  animal with her inborn gift of healing, who could use her hands  in the essential tasks so many of us have never learned. She was  wise too in the contrary ways of man and of the weather.  Sarah's house, which one came upon "down a white lane with  tender tamarisk lined" is a familiar picture. How many times  have we walked together along that narrow path, the turquoise  sea glinting through the dark tree trunks. Even her goats were  ours — young kids which we gave to Dolly and which she  raised and milked. Her dog was one of our generations of aire-  dales, christened Nelson in honour of Britain's great naval hero.  Certain descriptions strike me with peculiar poignancy: "Geraniums smoldered mid banana leaves even by moonlight. . . ."  I remember stepping out of our house as Mr. Allen exclaimed  at the strangely molten shade our crimson geraniums assumed  in the glare of a Bermuda moon.

"A thousand lilies lolled their yellow tongues,  The spider-flower over whips of green  Twinkled its web-like fronds in lacy-haze  Against the tall casava's classic leaves.  And round the garden mottled match-me-can  Its hedge of terra cotta closed about,  And lifted proudly walls against the wind.  Through it an archway passed, and here in spring  A tent of bougainvillea dripped and shed  Clusters of grape-dark blossoms, purple gloom  That ran like wine in sunlight. ..."  This is a factual description, by the poet turned into the image  of a tropical homestead. It is interesting to compare this brief  mention of the bougainvillea with the memorable description of  Anthony Adverse's first view of Father Francois in Havana,  working in the purple gloom of his bougainvillea arbor by the  sea.  Perhaps the essence of what Sarah represents comes in the description of her conversation:  "These words of hers all stood for something real,  A thing, a thought, an act original.  Direct communion with the summer light  In all the cups that held it had been hers  For more than ninety years, day after day.  Her mouth was savoury of it. And this dew  Of freshest thought fell on my bookman's ears  Like heavenly news to angels far from home.  No nervous generation trimmed her crown  Of life-fulfilled with paper flowers of youth;  Full-ripened seed pods nodded on her brows,  Ready to burst with rich exuberance,  Yet strong and beautiful upon the vine.  No oft repeated printings caged her in  With echoes of far-off experience;  No set experiments enfoiled her mind.  She dealt alone with the majestic spheres  Of facts empirical: what weathers came  And when but never why, what fish arrived  By season, how the hens laid in the spring,  But took a rest in summer, and what slips  Did best in sunlight, others by the wall,  What seeds to sow in winter, how to make  A garden give more beauty, shade and food,  •  36 	asu06600000210038001							65519924 Bytes	3849	5672	1925870652	RGB	8	600	asu06600000210038001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1422	1422	1423.jp2	/asu0660/image/1423.jp2

Thus looked her mind upon terrestrial ways  Like a small sun—more than a pleasant moon  With dead reflected light—and drawing up  The needful waters let them down again  Upon the proper place to make things grow,  From early morning till the twilight fell.  Her rest was but light's absence in the night."  The hurricane is another portion of the poem that was a real  experience for Hervey Allen. During the hurricane of 1926 he  was in a sponging schooner off Governor's Harbor in the Bahamas. The crew reached shore and he sheltered himself from  the storm in the bottom of an abandoned well, while winds  screamed overhead.  " The sun went out.  And with a metal scream from scorching throats  Of white-maned horses in a molten sea,  The storm shot down and writhed his whips about. . . ."  Hervey Allen was acutely conscious of the comparative closeness in time of our pioneer forefathers. His grandfather, as a  young man of eighteen, had walked from St. Louis to the Oregon  Territory. In fact, it was he who suggested the name of Washington for the state. Mr. Allen felt that, given sufficient incentive, there was no task man could not accomplish. With this  same spirit Sarah built her house, and also set forth in the row-  boat through the storm-tossed waves to rescue the shipwrecked  sailor and drag him back to her snug house.  "This was the final, bitterest test of all  Between her spirit and the elements.  Only the strong heart and the vivid mind  That long for life, more life, and ever life,  And chose the way to find it through the storm,  Brought her at last to shelter. . .."  The poem is an indictment of industrialism. Where, in the hectic  pattern of city living, can one draw strength to face with fortitude  the ultimate tragedy that awaits us all?

So her steady eyes  Turned on her children with no hurt despair,  But hope and happiness and trust fulfilled."  While in comparison her neighbors, "Angry at their own starved  and troubled lives — clutched at things like low, earth-creeping  vines, strangling themselves by their too avid clasp!* As the poet  goes on to say, it was lucky for Sarah that things were stored in  chests, and not inside her heart to gloat upon until they faded  there.  "For she was one with nature in her place,  Part of the winds that blew across warm seas,  Of rainbow mists, blue water, and white air,  Sunshine like angels' shadows on the world,  Vine leaves, and bodies of soft living things,  And of the sandy and the coloured earth,  Red clay that gestates lilies, and dark loam.  The very essence of it in a mould  Of mild perfection with a crystal mind  Clear as the air it looked through from her eyes."  "Sarah Simon: Character Atlantean" is no "Paul and Vir-  ginie," an idyll of fantasy, but the story of a real woman coping  in the most womanly way with the crises that life brings. In  fact, the writer repeats this when he says:  "She found both seeds and eggs contained a plan  With which she must agree if she would reap  Increase and benefit for her own needs.  Thus saw things as they were, not as she wished  That they might be to suit some other scheme  That might do well enough on Mercury."  These lines seem to reflect the essence of Hervey Allen's own  being. He was a composite of idealism and realism, his imagination focussed on a whole which encompassed all details. These  he always viewed as but component parts of an overall unit.  In vivid contrasts to Sarah and her way of life is Stephen Old-  fields, scholar, a man who lived by books and thus vicariously.  The impact of his learning and worldly standards on Sarah's  children is the root of her tragedy. Their two worlds cannot  mate, yet cannot remain unmarked by one another.

"Sarah Simon: Character Atlantean"					Allen, Ann Andrews																											asu0660000021	"■—sorrow came for Sarah from his words,  For as her children grew from year to year  Their eyes were slowly closed to all her world.  They slipped by trivial things away from her:"  In matters of education Hervey Allen felt strongly that it was as  important to educate the hands as it was the head—that unless  the two can work in harmony, one cannot become a whole man.  This, he thought, was one of the great lacks in much of modern  teaching.  To me one of the most vivid sections in the poem is Sarah's  visit to the church to thank the minister and Mr. Oldfields for  their kindness to her children. The scarlet-robed, complete woman, listening to the violent lesson about the whores of Babylon,  and fleeing from the snickering congregation, is a startling and  terrifying picture. Here again we are confronted with two civilizations which can never understand one another and so one  lashes out in hatred against that which threatens its complacency.  Sarah's reaction is the summation of parental frustration, of the  frustration of teachers as well.  "And if she could not make her children hear  What wind and water, sun and earth might say,  Then she would keep that secret for herself  And let them keep their world away from her.  She would not tell them what they could not hear;  She could not show them what they would not see.  That was the limitation of her life.  "She lived to be; they only lived to have"—these lines sum up the  essential difference between the two worlds. Though Hervey  Allen was deeply read in theology and philosophy, much of his  own private religion might be summed up in the description of  Sarah's attitude:  'There was a life she knew, that they called 'God',  And went to church about it, but she felt  And saw, and dealt with; it with her. And round  Her head was wrapped its mystery of stars;  Its voice was in the wind, and in the light  And warmth she felt it beating, and beheld  The ebb and flow of it from plant to seed  And down the generations of the birds  And dogs and goats that lived about her door.

"Sarah Simon: Character Atlantean"					Allen, Ann Andrews																											asu0660000021	When he came suddenly out of the sea;  Was still about her at the cool of night  And yet again at morning—glory out  Of glory out of glory, hence removed  But only changed when something stopped to die.  This was the golden wellspring of her soul,  Sparkling with life beyond the needs of men  Who seemed to her to have withdrawn from it,  And not to know they were a part of it,  And still might share, for it was all about  But they had words that once had root in things  And then had lost them. So they now had words  Without the life to make the sound alive."  Hervey Allen was a traditional, a romantic poet. He used the  world about him, as well as his comprehensive memory of the  past, to write with clarity, music and forceful imagery. His  themes were never petty, nor were they despairing. Nothing in  life was as important to him as poetry; towards this he was truly  dedicated. He was dexterous in his use of verse forms, in  "Sarah Simon" the iambic pentameter flows so naturally that  one is hardly conscious of the rhythm — it becomes the integral  form of the poem, lending fluidity and variety within its basic  retaining wall.  Bermuda was the ideal poetic climate for Hervey Allen. It  gave a serene, continuous and beautiful background from which  the inner harmony of the poet's imagination could flow with  ease. In the five years of our life there, Hervey Allen wrote more  poetry by far than in the seventeen years which followed, interrupted as they were by the intense and hectic impingement of  the world without. The Bermuda way typified a life to which he  longed to return, which stands symbolized in the person of  Sarah Simon, Character Atlantean.  40  , 	asu06600000210042001							65848048 Bytes	3861	5683	137749097	RGB	8	600	asu06600000210042001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1426	1426	1427.jp2	/asu0660/image/1427.jp2

The Lorsch Gospels; Facsimile in the University of Miami Library					Riley, Eleanor																											asu0660000031	THE  CARRELL  The Lorsch Gospels; Facsimile in the  University of Miami Library  ELEANOR RILEY  The Lorsch Gospels, more properly the Lorscher Evan-  geliar, was the last ceremonial manuscript made  at Charlemagne's court scriptorium in Aachen. It is  thought to have been commissioned by the Emperor about  810, four years before his death, but the date of its presentation to Lorsch Abbey is not known. A "Gospel Book written  in gold with paintings and ivory covers" is all that is recorded  in the abbey library's oldest catalog, compiled around 830.  Only the gatehouse of the abbey survives, its grandeur evidence of the Emperor's particular, generous patronage.  The history of the manuscript from the fifteenth century  on is bizarre, and it is remarkable that any of it has survived.  In the gutter of the last blank page there is a note which states  the book was rebound in 1479 by order of Eberhard von  Wassen, the abbey's provost. On this date, possibly earlier, the  large volume was divided into two more or less equal sections, the first ending with the Gospel of St. Mark, the second  beginning with Luke. The ivory Madonna, the originial front  cover, became the front cover of section one, and the ivory  Christ, the back cover, became the front cover of section two.  The manuscript was still intact when, in the middle of the  sixteenth century, the abbey's library merged with the Heidelberg Palatina. During the Thirty Years War, in 1622, Heidelberg was taken by the Catholic League, and the entire Palatina  library was expropriated by the Vatican. Part two of the  Lorsch Gospels arrived safely at its destination in Rome, but  the first part was allegedly sold to a Roman collector by the 	asu06600000310003001							67309584 Bytes	3937	5697	2642510328	RGB	8	600	asu06600000310003001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1432	1432	1433.jp2	/asu0660/image/1433.jp2
The Lorsch Gospels; Facsimile in the University of Miami Library					Riley, Eleanor																											asu0660000031	legate in charge of moving the library. At the end of the  eighteenth century it appeared in the collection of Cardinal  Migazzi of Vienna, in a simple eighteenth-century binding. In  1785 he sold it to Count Ignaz Batthyany, Bishop of Transylvania, who placed it in his library, now the Biblioteca  Documentara Batthayneum, in Alba Julia, Romania, and there  it remains. The Bucharest National Library has it cataloged  as Codex aureus, part I. The Madonna cover disappeared until  1853, when it was sold at auction in Cologne as part of the  Peter Leven Collection; and a few years later it was acquired  by the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Late in the  eighteenth century the Vatican Library rebound the second  section, retaining the original Heidelberg Palatina catalog  number, Pal. lat. 50, and the Christ cover was given to the  Vatican's Museo Sacro.  Both parts of the codex, as well as the ivory covers, came  together again briefly in 1965 for a major exhibition in Aachen  entitled, Karl der Grosse, Werke und Wirkung, and at that  time it was photographed for the facsimile edition. The University of Miami Library's facsimile is copy number 372 of  1000 copies printed.  The manuscript is made of almost flawless vellum. The  section in the Vatican is one centimeter taller than that in  Romania. This discrepancy in size must go back to the codex's  early history, for the original back cover, the ivory Christ, is  nearly one centimeter taller than the front cover. The facsimile  measures approximately 36.5 x 26.5 centimeters, between one  and two centimeters smaller than the original. All of the  leaves are reproduced, recto and verso, and 54 of the 474  pages are in color. In the eighteenth century the Romanian  section was foliated and paginated in pencil by either Magazzi  or Batthyany and the Vatican Library's half was foliated  in ink. The clumsy ownership stamps of both libraries blight  almost every leaf.  As with all Carolingian Gospel Books, the Lorsch manuscript closely adheres to the vulgate prototype of St. Jerome.  It begins with St. Jerome's preface, Incipit prsefatio sancti  HieronimL Plures fuisse ..., followed by his dedicatory letter  to Pope Damasus in which the Canon Tables, twelve numerical  concordances to the Gospels, are explained. The Cannon Tables 	asu06600000310004001							67187904 Bytes	3895	5748	942356429	RGB	8	600	asu06600000310004001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1433	1433	1434.jp2	/asu0660/image/1434.jp2
The Lorsch Gospels; Facsimile in the University of Miami Library					Riley, Eleanor																											asu0660000031	come next; and these are followed by the main section of the  work, the four Gospels according to Matthew, Mark, Luke and  John, each preceded by a prologue and an index. A Capitulare  Evangeliorum anni circuli, which indexes all four Gospels  according to the liturgical year, concludes the codex.  The text, up to the last few leaves, is in gold uncials, with  an occasional phrase in emphatic red. Headings are either in  square capitals, resembling letters carved in stone, or rustic  capitals, which are more obviously executed with a pen than  imitative of work done with a chisel. The only section of the  manuscript in the innovative, entirely cursive Carolingian  minuscule, is the Capitulare. Each page of text is in two columns, and except for the Capitulare, they are enclosed in  decorative borders that were painted before the text was  added. The model for this format may have been the sixth-  century Rabbula Gospels. The border motifs of each two-page  spread are not repeated. They are purely decorative floral  and geometric designs in brilliant combinations of colors; in  one instance the artist related the design to the text: borders  with a fish motif surround the parable of the loaves and fishes  in the Gospel according to St. John (leaves 98v-99r). Each  border is enclosed in a narrow gold frame with an inner band  of silver, and simple gold squares form terminals at the  corners.  The Lorsch Gospels are illuminated in the Court School  style—also called the Ada School (after one of the manuscripts in the group), the Trier School (where the Ada codex  is located), and, occasionally, the Rhineland School. Since most  art historians now agree that all of the manuscripts in this  style were made at the Aachen court scriptorium, Court School  (Hofschule in German) seems the most appropriate term.  There is no question that the first manuscript of this  school was the Godescalc Evangelistary, an illustrated selection of Gospel texts, made between 781 and 783, and the last  was the Lorsch codex, dated 810. The other surviving, complete, Gospel Books of the school, in more or less chronological  order are: a Gospel Book from Saint-Martin-des-Champs,  now in the Arsenal Library, Paris; the Ada Gospels at Trier  (the Evangelist portraits are later than the rest of the manuscript) ; the Abbeville Gospels from the abbey of Saint-Riquier 	asu06600000310005001							67138536 Bytes	3903	5732	3102840581	RGB	8	600	asu06600000310005001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1434	1434	1435.jp2	/asu0660/image/1435.jp2
The Lorsch Gospels; Facsimile in the University of Miami Library					Riley, Eleanor																											asu0660000031	(also called the Centula Gospels, after the abbey's original  name) ; the Harley Gospels in the British Museum; and the  Soissons Gospels in the Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris. The  prevalence of royal purple, gold, silver and jewels in the  illumination of all these manuscripts creates an image of  imperial splendor equal to the courts of Constantine and  Justinian, which Charlemagne set about determinedly to  emulate.  In 796 Einhard, Charlemagne's future biographer, replaced Alcuin and Theodulf as the controlling force of the  Aachen scriptorium. From then on most Insular elements,  e.g. the elaborate interlace in such manuscripts as the Book  of Kells, disappeared from the art of the court, and the  Carolingian Renaissance flourished. An accomplished artist  himself, Einhard favored the Late Antique style of Rome,  and it is quite likely that he imported artists from Italy, as  well as from the Eastern Empire. Those who produced the  so-called "Palace School" manuscripts, which are classicizing in nearly every respect, are thought to have been Greeks  from Constantinople who had kept Hellenistic traditions alive.  One theory is that they worked with artists of the Court  School and influenced them. The Lorsch illuminations, representing the final stage of the Court School, are the most restrained, most closely allied to the Antique style, of the entire  school. They still have, however, abstract elements and dazzling color that are traditionally Germanic.  The transition from Insular to Late Antique decoration  is most evident in the Cannon Tables of the Court School  Gospel Books. The first complete Book, the Arsenal (before  795), has Cannon Tables in an Antique architectural setting,  but the rendering is two-dimensional and the decoration consists of Hiberno-Saxon interlace and spirals. While the Canon  Tables of the Harley Gospels (ca. 800) still have a trace of  Insular decoration, in those of Soissons and Lorsch it is gone  altogether. There lingers, however, a Hiberno-Saxon horror  vacui in the Soissons Canon Tables that is not present in  Lorsch. In Soissons each lunette contains all four apocalyptic  beasts holding the title tablet, whereas in the Lorsch lunettes  one or two angels hold the tablet, or it is surrounded by a  simple plant motif. Except for the first and twelfth Canon 	asu06600000310006001							67323392 Bytes	3902	5749	4214643589	RGB	8	600	asu06600000310006001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1435	1435	1436.jp2	/asu0660/image/1436.jp2

In Early Christian art angels similar to those in Canon  Primus carry the monogram of Christ. Two other types, the  "reaching angel" and the angel holding the tablet from behind, were used in the Rabbula Gospels Ascension miniature,  painted around 586. All have antecedents in the Victorias  that carry trophy poles in the triumphal arch reliefs of the  late Roman Empire. The figure style is naturalistic; unlike  the sketchy rendering of the Rabbula angels, contours are  carefully drawn, and plasticity is achieved through shading.  Except for the color, which is more vivid, the Lorsch  Canon Tables resemble an isolated Latin Canon Table in the  Vatican Library thought to have come from a sixth-century  Italian Gospel Book. This is especially true of Canon Primus,  the most classical of the twelve, and the only one with a  pair of peacocks, the ancient symbol of immortality, in the  spandrels.  The great variety of birds that occupy the spandrels of  the other Canon Tables may have been copied from Greek  manuscripts of the sixth century, contemporary with the  Rossano Gospels. Many of them resemble birds in the annular  vault mosaics of Santa Costanza in Rome, a Constantinian  church with pagan as well as Early Christian symbols. It is  also possible that the court artists had access to Dioscurides'  treatises, accurately illustrated texts on zoology, botany and  medicine compiled in the first century and widely copied  throughout the Middle Ages. Although the Lorsch, birds are  accurately drawn, their plumage is unnaturally resplendent.  Many of the spandrels are decorated with stylized vines,  acanthus leaves, and large, vivid, exotic flowers. In some  lunettes gold and red grape vines resembling those in the mosaic decoration of the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia, Ravenna,  entwine the title tablet. The main arches are filled with abstract ornamentation, some vegetal, some geometric, reminiscent of that in the Justinianic mosaics of Ravenna; and most  contain antique cameos with minute Biblical scenes, few of  which are recognizable. 	asu06600000310007001							66492444 Bytes	3854	5749	2162427518	RGB	8	600	asu06600000310007001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1436	1436	1437.jp2	/asu0660/image/1437.jp2
The Lorsch Gospels; Facsimile in the University of Miami Library					Riley, Eleanor																											asu0660000031	The columns are rendered in a variety of hues and patterns. The use of marble columns in manuscript illumination  was not new, but previous examples were never this gorgeous.  Two capitals, in Canon Secundus In Quo Tres (p. 17), have  Herculean figures, similar to those in Late Roman reliefs,  supporting the arch, but most are the Corinthian, acanthus  leaf type, vaguely resembling those in the Aachen chapel.  The abstract rendering, vibrant, and touched with gold, is  probably the invention of the artist, as are the fanciful bases  and the barely-perceptible faces worked into the veins of some  of the marble (p. 13 and 17).  Following the Canon Tables, the first miniature appears,  the author portrait of St. Matthew. Much has been written  about the Court School figure style and its prototypes, but  no direct models have been discovered. Undoubtedly the artists  were strongly influenced by miniatures in pre-Iconoclastic  manuscripts from Italy and Constantinople that Charlemagne  had acquired for the Aachen scriptorium, but none of these  have survived; their characteristics must be based on extant  mosaics and small carvings of the same period, and their  earlier exemplars.  The first artist of the Court School to overcome the two-  dimensional figure style of pre-Carolingian art was Godescalc.  The first to place this figure in a plausible architectural setting,  possibly based on a lost Italian model, was the artist of the  Abbeville Gospels, some ten years later; and this was the composition used by the school from then on. As with the Canon  Tables, the Evangelist portraits became more classicizing  with successive manuscripts. Extraneous elements were gradually eliminated, and the background receded, creating a sense  of spatial illusionism. The ornamental frames surrounding the  arcades of the Soissons Evangelists were discarded in Lorsch,  and the birds and angels in the spandrels were replaced with  simple plant forms. The Lorsch arcades resemble those of the  Canon Tables, except that there is now only one cameo, in the  center of the arch.  Because the Evangelist's symbol was moved to a lunette,  illustrating communication between man and symbol became  difficult and was eventually abandoned. Unlike the Godescalc  Matthew and his angel who have eye to eye contact, the Lorsch 	asu06600000310008001							67342524 Bytes	3897	5758	3213608232	RGB	8	600	asu06600000310008001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1437	1437	1438.jp2	/asu0660/image/1438.jp2
The Lorsch Gospels; Facsimile in the University of Miami Library					Riley, Eleanor																											asu0660000031	Evangelist and his symbol are in two different worlds, psychologically as well as physically. Matthew frowns at his pen,  while the angel is about to receive the Word and write it  down, quite separately.  The bearded Evangelist, perhaps copied from a pre-Icono-  clastic Byzantine manuscript that was in the scriptorium,  was discarded after Godescalc in favor of the young, beardless types with round heads, similar to those in seventh-  century Roman wall paintings that reflect Greek influence. In  the Soissons and Lorsch Gospels the bearded figure was reintroduced, and both types were used. However, the bearded  heads are more square than any of Godescalc's, and the eyes  do not dominate the face. By this final stage of the Court  School elements from all previous models had been absorbed,  and new variations and combinations were created. One obvious example of this eclecticism is seen in the Soissons and  Lorsch portraits of Matthew: St. Matthew in Soissons became the angel in Lorsch.  As in the Canon Table angels, modeling of the figure was  achieved through shading within a linear framework. Unlike  the Palace School Evangelist portraits, where paint was  used freely and the edges blurred, in Lorsch the color was  carefully applied, dark where a form recedes, lighter where  it protrudes. The drapery folds are linear and decorative, and  fall into Byzantine "hooks" at the hemline, but, as in the  classical Palace School portraits, there is a sense of anatomy  beneath the garments.  The sloping hills with plants and the wall with shadowed  windows are Late Antique elements, and although spatial il-  lusionism in the classical manner was not achieved (and probably not desired), the figure is in a plausible space. Completely  nonclassical are the cubistic writing stand, the askew footstool,  and the vibrant blues and oranges juxtaposed with lavender  and pastel green, carryovers from the Merovingian period.  The page facing Matthew's portrait is not the usual initial  page of his Gospel, but an illuminated Argumentum to it. An  Argumentum, also called a Prxfatio Prologus, precedes each  of the four Gospels in most of the Court School manuscripts.  These prologues were written by the Spanish bishop Priscillian 	asu06600000310009001							67060340 Bytes	3908	5718	3234770348	RGB	8	600	asu06600000310009001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1438	1438	1439.jp2	/asu0660/image/1439.jp2
The Lorsch Gospels; Facsimile in the University of Miami Library					Riley, Eleanor																											asu0660000031	in the fourth century as keys to the meaning of the Gospels,  but the writing is so obscure and mystical that it was not until  the beginning of this century that a British Benedictine,  Father John Chapman, identified them with Priscillian and  successfully translated them into English. Priscillian, suspected of dabbling in the occult, was executed in 385 for  practicing magic, and it was assumed that all of his writings  had been destroyed until some were rediscovered in the nineteenth century.  A miniature unique to the Lorsch Gospels illustrates the  beginning of the Argumentum. The "Ancestors of Christ"  miniature (also called the "Elevated Christ") is thought to  have come from a sixth-century Italian model. Above the text,  in an oblong frame supported by four columns, are three  lozenges, each containing fourteen standing figures. Floating  over the heads of each group is a framed portrait bust of one  of Christ's ancestors. A youthful, beardless, Christ as teacher,  holding a book with His left hand and blessing with His right,  sits in a mandorla that perches on a rostrum above the center  group. The portrait directly under Christ is labeled David,  on Christ's left Jechonias, and although the one on His right  is not labeled it can be deduced from Matthew 1:12-17, and  also by the fact he is bearded, that he is Abraham. It has been  suggested that the composition represents an Early Christian  procession of icons. The dress, however, except for that of  Christ, is Frankish, and the figures with arms raised are  reminiscent of those in the Liberalitas relief in the Arch of  Constantine. It is also posited that the artist was inspired  by the Argumentum to Matthew rather than the Gospel itself,  choosing the words Sique quaternario denario numero tri-  formitor posito (And so, having thrice set down fourteen  generations). But Jechonias' name does not appear in the  Argumentum, and it can be argued that this miniature is  just as strongly linked iconographically to Matthew 1:12-17:  "And after the carrying away to Babylon Jechonias begot  Salathiel... So all the generations from Abraham to David  are fourteen generations; and from David to the carrying  away to Babylon fourteen generations; and from the carrying  away to Babylon to Christ fourteen generations."  Throughout the Lorsch Gospels the Argumentum faces the  Evangelist portrait, but this is the only one that is illustrated.  8 	asu06600000310010001							66983748 Bytes	3909	5710	1203162807	RGB	8	600	asu06600000310010001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1439	1439	1440.jp2	/asu0660/image/1440.jp2
The Lorsch Gospels; Facsimile in the University of Miami Library					Riley, Eleanor																											asu0660000031	The predominant hues of blue, lavender and orange relate this  miniature to the portrait of Matthew; and, as in the Canon  Tables, there is design through color across a two-page spread.  A Brevarium, also called a Capitula, follows the Argumentum  and serves as an index to the Gospel.  The Gospel according to Matthew is preceded by a magnificent Christ in Majesty, a miniature not seen in Court  School manuscripts since the Godescalc Evangelistary. On  vellum stained royal purple it faces the initial page of the  Gospel, also stained purple. Christ is seated on a throne, the  back of which consists of a pedimented frame with tied-back  curtains, a setting that has its roots in classical antiquity.  The portrait of Christ is an enlarged version of the one in  the Ancestors miniature. The volumetric head, as Matthew's,  is carefully modeled through shading, but the greenish cast  to the skin, seen in Late Byzantine painting, suggests He is  not of this world. His auburn hair falls gracefully in three  equal strands over each shoulder; the drapery design, similar  to that of Matthew, has tassels on the sleeves copied from  Byzantine court dress. Encircling Christ is a wreath containing the four apocalyptic beasts and eight angels. The wreath  motif is Late Antique, symbolizing harmony between the four  Evangelists and their Gospels which are to follow. There is no  existing model that includes the eight angels, and they may  have been a Carolingian addition. The inscription is not from  the Bible, but was composed by Carolingian theologians:  Quattuor ergo viros animalia sancta figurant sacra salutiferi  narrantes munera Christi. (The sacred animals represent the  four men who report the sacred gifts to Christ.)  Some of the motifs in the ornate frame are Byzantine—  for instance the pearl bands and optical fretwork; while  others, such as the delicate cameos, previously discussed, and  the panels of spectra are Antique. The Court School artists  from Italy and Byzantium would have been familiar with these  designs, but they must also have seen first hand the gold and  silver work, jewelry and textiles—in addition to the manuscripts—that the Emperor received as gifts from Rome and  the East.  In this one instance only, because of the facing Christ in  Majesty, the Incipit page and the initial page of the Gospel  are combined. It is also the only page of the entire manuscript 	asu06600000310011001							66839004 Bytes	3891	5724	2557957795	RGB	8	600	asu06600000310011001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1440	1440	1441.jp2	/asu0660/image/1441.jp2

The ends of  the organic L and I in LIBER are virtual cornucopias of  interlace and spirals. Within the curve of the L an alpha  and omega dangle from the arms of an abstract Greek cross,  and two birds appear to be fighting. Another bird is perched  in an exotic flowering plant that grows out of the L's haunch.  Tongue-shaped leaves hang from the inside of the frame and  touch the tops of the words INC I PIT EVAN.... The agitation of this page is a strange contrast to the calm dignity of  the Christ in Majesty. Linking the two together are their  identical frames and their color.  More than any other in the manuscript, this two-page  spread creates the impression of set jewels and fine textiles  reminiscent of Justinianic mosaics; but also, because of the  purple ground with accents of gold, vermilion, blue and white,  it has the sumptuousness of Germanic cloisonne.  The remaining three Gospels follow a more conventional  arrangement: author portrait, Argumentum, Brevarium, In-  cipit page and facing initial page on which the Gospel begins.  In the portrait of Mark there are some similarities to that  of Matthew. Mark has the same square head, is bearded and  frowning, and is seated in front of a wall with windows. As in  Matthew, the color scheme is predominantly blue, lavender  and vermilion. In contrast to the frontality of Matthew, Mark's  body is oblique, as is the bench which nearly slides out of the  picture, and he is therefore a less monumental figure. With  pen raised to his ear, he appears to be listening, waiting for  inspiration, as classical philosophers were depicted listening  to their muses. The body in profile in combination with the  raised pen is a mixed figure type not used before by the Court  School. The expectant Evangelist is as oblivious to his symbol,  a fierce lion lunging out of an agitated sky, as his symbol is  to him. Adding to the instability of the composition are the  abstract writing stand and the twisted columns. The columns  had an actual prototype: the sanctuary screen of Old St.  Peter's in Rome, which also inspired Bernini's magnificent  Baldachin for the new basilica.  Luke is taken from an entirely different model. His chin  is pointed and beardless; and the frown and large eyes, similar  to those of the Godescalc Evangelists, and dark complexion  10 	asu06600000310012001							67207340 Bytes	3907	5732	1884219274	RGB	8	600	asu06600000310012001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1441	1441	1442.jp2	/asu0660/image/1442.jp2

Pen and ink are on the writing  stand, and he displays the Book as if it is already completed.  He is the only Lorsch Evangelist who sits in an exedra, a  device used frequently in earlier Court School Gospel Books;  but in this case the back is low, and instead of its being draped,  a curtain is looped around one side. Except for the golden bull,  the colors are darker and more somber than in any other  miniature; rusty red and muddy yellow dominate. Compared  to Matthew and Mark, Luke looks frail, and on the verge of  being overpowered by the organic writing stand and the monumental beast. It is as if the arcade had been done by one  artist, the principal one, and the Evangelist by another.  The most beautiful portrait, and the most classical of any  of the Court School Evangelists, is that of John. The model  for this figure type in a curtained arcade probably had its  antecedents in a fourth-century Roman calendar with a likeness of the Emperor Constantius in a similar pose and setting.  The symmetry of the composition, with emphasis on the horizontal, gives a restful quality to the picture. There is a  stylized landscape of gently rolling green and lavendar hills,  and an atmospheric sky of Persian blue at the horizon line  fading to turquoise in the lunette. John himself is serene. He  is the only round-faced, non-frowning Evangelist of the four;  and, except for the hair, which is short and straight, his head  resembles that of an angel in an early eighth-century Roman  icon of the Virgin. He is also the so-called "quill-dipping"  type, used previously in Court School portraits, but with  precedents as early as the sixth century. The drapery folds  are less active than in the other portraits, and thus are not  in conflict with the patterned fabric. Silks made in Constantinople in the late eighth century had the same circular designs;  and one surviving example, the "Charioteer Silk," is thought  to have been buried with Charlemagne. Instead of the usual  cameo, there is an open book in the center of the arch, perhaps symbolic of John's opening lines: "In the beginning was  the word." The enormous vermilion eagle over the Evangelist's  head is a startling reminder that this is a Carolingian painting.  Compared to the Gospel of Matthew, the remaining three  Incipit and opening pages of the Gospels are austere. No  Roman, Byzantine or Insular models for them are known,  but Late Antique traditions in a new Carolingian interpreta-  15 	asu06600000310017001							67081544 Bytes	3899	5733	804875277	RGB	8	600	asu06600000310017001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1446	1446	1447.jp2	/asu0660/image/1447.jp2

Incipit Marcum and the facing Initium  evangelii IHV XPI Filii Dei sicut are in black rustic capitals  on bands of gold and silver. Byzantine twisted ribbon motifs,  similar to those used in Ravenna mosaics, surround the frames.  The Incipit Lucam and Quoniam pages have the same format  as the text pages, except all of the lettering is in extended gold  rustic capitals. The Vatican Library stamp is strategically  placed in the center of the Q. The Johannes Incipit and opening lines are in extended red rustic capitals on a gold ground  with simple borders, giving a formality to the most mystical  words of the Gospels: In principio erat verbum.  The Lorsch Gospels conclude with a Capitulare Evan-  geliorum anni circuit, also called a Comes, that indexes the  Gospels' passages (Pericopes) according to use. With the  aid of a calendar of feast days, the clergy could easily find  the appropriate passages to read at Mass throughout the  liturgical year. Some headings are in red (the reproduction  of this section is not in color) ; these "red-letter days" were  of special importance to whoever commissioned the manuscript, in this case Charlemagne. The Capitulare is the only  section of the codex written in clear Carolingian minuscule,  and it is entirely devoid of decoration. The probable reason is  that it served a purely utilitarian purpose, and was therefore  separated from the sacred texts in every respect.  Just as the Court School artists borrowed elements from  earlier manuscripts, their manuscripts became exemplars at  scriptoriums during the Ottoman period. That the Lorsch  Gospels served as a model for the Gero Evangelistary there  can be no doubt. Many of the Late Antique elements, however, as interpreted by the Carolingians, are missing. The Gero  St. John, with a heavy jaw and thick neck, is a less attractive,  less ideal, figure than the Lorsch St. John, and spatial illusion-  ism has almost entirely disappeared. The curtains and rolling  hills have been replaced with a wall, there is no perspective  to the writing stand, and no attempt was made to keep the  sun within the bounds of the arch. This artist was separated  from the Carolingian Renaissance by more than one hundred  and fifty years; and from its classical prototypes entirely.  16 	asu06600000310018001							66644368 Bytes	3879	5725	737202844	RGB	8	600	asu06600000310018001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1447	1447	1448.jp2	/asu0660/image/1448.jp2
Otto G. Richter and the University of Miami Library					McNeal, Archie L.																											asu0660000031	Otto G. Richter and the  University of Miami Library  ARCHIE L. McNEAL  Otto George Richter was born on August 18, 1892, in  I Jeannette, Pennsylvania, a small town near Pittsburgh, where his father owned the Hotel Marion. He  was one of three children and first generation American, his  father having come from Stuttgart, Germany, as a child.  He worked his way through college by serving as night  bookkeeper and chief accountant in the Hotel Schenley in  Pittsburgh. After three years of engineering study at Carnegie  Institute of Technology, he took a year off in order to devote  full time to the problems of the almost bankrupt hotel. During  this time, as well as while studying engineering, he took a  correspondence course in accounting. After this one year out  of college, and having achieved some success with the hotel,  he returned to Carnegie Tech where he secured his degree in  electrical engineering.  He knew by this time that he meant to make accounting  his life work and went on to take the Pennsylvania examination for Certified Public Accounting. He was then employed  by Main & Company, one of the largest public accounting  firms in Pittsburgh, and by the time he was 24 he had become  a full partner in the firm. Soon afterward, he took a military  leave-of-absence and served as a lieutenant in the United  States Navy during World War I. He was in charge of all  manufacturing cost-plus contracts for the Navy during this  time.  At the age of 26, he founded his own accounting firm,  Richter & Company, in Pittsburgh. He is reputed to have had  17 	asu06600000310019001							66600784 Bytes	3863	5745	2703184622	RGB	8	600	asu06600000310019001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1448	1448	1449.jp2	/asu0660/image/1449.jp2

Richter and the University of Miami Library					McNeal, Archie L.																											asu0660000031	as clients some of the largest industrial, legal and commercial  firms in that manufacturing city because of his brilliance in  corporate taxes. He was a general partner not only of Pace,  Gore & McLaren, Accountants & Auditors, New York City,  but of other accounting firms across the country and even in  Havana, Cuba. He was auditor of Farmers National Bank, in  which building he maintained his suite of offices; was certified  in Ohio and New York; was authorized to practice before the  U.S. Treasury Department and was one of a select group that  had the responsibility for audits of the U.S. mints.  During the time he was engaged in his profession in Pittsburgh, Mr. Richter was active in civic and professional organizations. He served as Chairman, Pittsburgh Chapter,  Pennsylvania Institute of Certified Public Accountants; Vice-  President and President of Pennsylvania Institute of Certified  Public Accountants; Chairman, Pittsburgh Chapter, American  Institute of Accountants, member of Pittsburgh Chamber of  Commerce Committees on Taxation and Legislation, and Real  Estate and Taxation; American Society of Certified Public  Accountants; National Association of Cost Accountants; Allegheny County Civic Club. Social organizations in Pittsburgh  claiming his membership were Pittsburgh Athletic Association  (charter member); Keystone Athletic Club; Union League;  Duquesne Club; Longue Vue Country Club (charter member).  He was also a 32° Mason and Life Member of Syria Mosque  in Pittsburgh.  During World War I, while stationed in Washington, D.C.,  he met Nannie Conway Powell, from a prominent family of  Fairfax, Virginia, who had previously been a school teacher  but patriotically came to Washington to do her part in war  work. Mr. Richter was cautious—he would not propose until  after the war. On March 24, 1919, they were married and he  returned to Pittsburgh with his bride. She joined the Southern  Club, a group of Southern ladies who had moved to Pittsburgh with their Northern husbands, and was one of the most  popular and active members. The "Southern Ball," an annual  charity affair, was usually held on December 28 and always  at the Hotel Schenley where Mr. Richter had worked while  going to Carnegie Tech. She also belonged to the Tuesday  Musical Club; she played the piano and sang.

Sadly,  she died of a cerebral hemorrhage two days before Thanksgiving in 1935.  Mr. and Mrs. Richter had one daughter, Jane Taylor  Richter. Jane attended Winchester School in Pittsburgh until  her mother's death. Her father felt that because of her youth  she needed more supervision than he was able to devote to her  because of his business activities and sent her to National  Cathedral School in Washington, D.C. She graduated at the  age of 16 and went on to college, graduating from Florida  Southern College in Lakeland in 1942, with a Bachelor of  Arts major in Social Sciences and minor in Business Administration. In 1953 she earned the degree of Juris Doctor  from the University of Miami School of Law.  In 1938 Otto Richter retired at the age of 45 for health  reasons and moved to Miami, first living on Miami Beach,  later moving to Miami. From approximately March, 1941  until his death Miss Margaret P. O'Brien was a member of  his household as nurse and housekeeper.  Mr. Richter maintained a suite of offices in the duPont  Building in Miami from which he conducted his personal  business affairs. He appeared in the Blue Book of Miami,  served as a member of the Executive Committee of the Miami  Heart Institute, the Committee of 100 of Miami Beach, the  Rod and Reel Club, and the Quarterdeck Club. During the  first part of World II, Mr. Richter was a member of the  Coast Guard Auxiliary, many times using his yacht, Milli-  cent HI, for rescue missions.  In 1951 Mr. Richter presented the University of Miami  with his first gift of $12,000 to establish the Richter Loan and  Scholarship Fund. Subsequent gifts brought the total to more  than $100,000. As a member of the University's Citizens  Board, he took the occasion to urge more community support.  He suggested "more and more contributing friends may now  wish to strengthen the University financially by providing  endowed professorships, scholarships and special services."  Mr. Thomas R. Reese, then vice-president and director of  financial research, at the dedication of the Otto G. Richter  Library in June, 1962 said of Mr. Richter: "Because of his  19 	asu06600000310021001							67003468 Bytes	3904	5719	3034004703	RGB	8	600	asu06600000310021001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1450	1450	1451.jp2	/asu0660/image/1451.jp2

Richter and the University of Miami Library					McNeal, Archie L.																											asu0660000031	continuing interest in education (having served as a voluntary  evening lecturer on tax accounting at both the University of  Pittsburgh and Duquesne University) and since he felt that  one did not have an opportunity to utilize his full potential  unless he acquired all the education possible, he became an  admirer of the University of Miami as it, like himself, was a  product of free enterprise and an example of progress made  by pulling itself up by its bootstraps."  During his years as student at Carnegie Tech, Mr. Richter  was a charter member of the Theta Xi Fraternity. In 1923  he was instrumental in helping Theta Xi purchase the property  at 5017 Forbes Avenue and build the house in which it was  located at the time of his death. He supported the efforts of  the Theta Xi Educational Foundation of Pittsburgh in 1959  to build a new fraternity house. Their efforts were being  thwarted by the 1938 policy of the school to purchase houses  for fraternity use and to operate them on the same financial  basis as its general dormitories. In a statement to the Trustees,  Faculty and Alumni of Carnegie Tech dated August 28, 1959  Dr. J. C. Warner, President of the institution, reviewed the  situation and described its evolution.  "All but two of the 12 fraternities have been thus accommodated; two chose to retain their own houses and  grounds," Dr. Warner said. Carnegie began a building pro-  program in 1955 and six of the ten participating fraternities  were occupying quarters in the new fraternity-dormitory  units by 1959. Dr. Warner then states: "We insist as a matter  of principle that room rentals for our students, whether or  not they are members of fraternities, must be comparable  throughout the campus. This, and our basic objection to the  'country club' approach led to the conclusion that the fraternity-dormitories must be consistent quality-wise with the  general dormitories ..."  This is the background of the disagreement which led  ultimately to the decision by Otto G. Richter to leave the bulk  of his estate to the University of Miami.  The Pittsburgh Press of August 23, 1959 reported: "The  battle over the fraternity house—which rests in the center  of the Tech campus—has raged unabated for eight years ac-  20 	asu06600000310022001							66378760 Bytes	3873	5711	2335905313	RGB	8	600	asu06600000310022001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1451	1451	1452.jp2	/asu0660/image/1452.jp2

Mr. Richter wanted it to be  kept independent of Tech's plan for college-supervised and  owned fraternity houses. Dr. John C. Warner, President of  Tech, and the school's board of trustees continued to fight for  control of all fraternities." The article then goes on to say:  "Mr. Richter... continued to correspond with Tech officials  over Theta Xi house issue and then changed his will giving  Tech 55 per cent and the University of Miami 45 per cent.  Then, in April of 1956, the will was redrawn giving Miami  67 per cent and Tech 33 per cent. But two days before his  death Mr. Richter picked up the chart at his hospital bedside, turned it over and wrote: "Everything at Carnegie Tech  to go to the University of Miami. Theta Xi to have fraternity  at Richter expense."  Otto G. Richter's estate was approximately $7,818,000 at  the time of his death. There were direct bequests totalling  $425,000 including $225,000 for the Theta Xi fraternity.  In a report to the University of Miami Board of Trustees  on October 4, 1960 Mr. Thomas Reese gave a detailed analysis  of the factors involved in the financial settlement of Mr.  Richter's estate. He described the work of the executors (he  being co-executor) and then presented the following statement :  "It has been a cause of great concern to me that the munificent bequest made by Mr. Richter has not received the  permanent and public recognition which naming a building  for him would provide. It is therefore my recommendation  to this board of trustees that an amount of $2,000,000 from  this bequest be allocated toward completing the planned  library on the campus of the University of Miami and that  it be named 'The Otto G. Richter Library'."  After general discussion during which the president of  the University of Miami, Dr. Jay F. W. Pearson, stressed the  urgent need for the University to "erase the stigma of not  having a library" the following resolution was unanimously  adopted:  "WHEREAS, in the opinion of this board of trustees, the  projected library building is a project of major importance  to the advancement of the University of Miami; and  21 	asu06600000310023001							66983828 Bytes	3909	5710	1959567542	RGB	8	600	asu06600000310023001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1452	1452	1453.jp2	/asu0660/image/1453.jp2
Otto G.

Richter, deceased, be allocated toward completing  the aforesaid proposed library building; and be it therefore  "RESOLVED, that within the provisions of the aforesaid  will, a sum not to exceed $2,000,000 from the bequest of the  late Mr. Richter be allocated toward completing the planned  library building on the campus of the University; and be it  "FURTHER RESOLVED, that as a lasting memorial to  Mr. Richter and in recognition of the great benevolence displayed by him in this bequest, the proposed library building  shall be known as 'The Otto G. Richter Library of the University of Miami'; and be it  "FURTHER RESOLVED, that the carrying out of the  aforesaid provisions of this resolution shall not preclude the  University from seeking and accepting memorial gifts from  other benefactors of the proposed library; and authorization  is hereby given for the designation of areas within the library  building to be named in honor of such donors."  At this same meeting, Mr. Reese informed the trustees  that he had just had confirmed "by another great and good  friend of the University (who must be anonymous at this  time) that up to $500,000 additional will be available as an  outright gift provided it is used to complete the library."  The planning of the library had begun in 1955 when President Pearson asked the Director of Libraries to prepare a  Statement of Program for the architects, Watson & Deutsch-  man, who had been selected to prepare plans for the library  building. It was not until 1959, however, that it became possible to construct the first unit of the proposed 192,000 square  feet general library. This initial unit of some 38,000 square  feet was made possible by a gift from George Brockway which  had been received in 1943, and from other sources including  a self-imposed tax voted by the University of Miami student  body to be added to the Student Activity Fee and earmarked  for a library building. The first unit was occupied on July  16, 1960.  The action by the Board of Trustees described above resulted in the development of working drawings for the com-  22 	asu06600000310024001							66777032 Bytes	3912	5688	491865273	RGB	8	600	asu06600000310024001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1453	1453	1454.jp2	/asu0660/image/1454.jp2

Bids were opened March  30, 1961 and the contract awarded on their low bid to M. R.  Harrison Co., on April 10, 1961. Construction was estimated  to require approximately one year. Actually, the Otto G.  Richter Library was formally dedicated on June 10, 1962.  On that occasion Mr. Thomas R. Reese was one of the  speakers and his remarks concerning his association with Mr.  Richter during their friendship from 1954 to the time of Mr.  Richter's death August 15, 1959 have provided some of the  biographical information included in this article. Mr. Reese  introduced Mrs. Ida Welfer, the sole surviving sister of Mr.  Richter, who came from California for the dedication.  The University of Miami owes a great debt of gratitude  to Otto G. Richter and we feel it is fitting that the University  Library which serves all the students, faculty, staff and alumni  is named for him as a lasting memorial.  In closing, it seems appropriate to quote from a letter of  August 25, 1959 from President Pearson to Mr. Richter's  daughter, Mrs. Jane Hoade:  "I want you to know how much all of us at the University  of Miami, who had the privilege of knowing your father, have  regretted his passing. He was a man of unusual ability and  tremendous social consciousness. He recognized community  problems and had the courage to take action with respect to  them. We will always remember him as an able and brilliant  citizen and a leader of men, and will be ever grateful to him  for his generosity and for his belief in the American-way-of-  life and free enterprise."  23 	asu06600000310025001							67264900 Bytes	3907	5737	2428348689	RGB	8	600	asu06600000310025001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1454	1454	1455.jp2	/asu0660/image/1455.jp2

Bak Toum and I Tam					Perry, Ronald, 1932-																											asu0660000033	THE  CARRELL  Volume 21 1983  Bak Toum and I Tarn  by Ronald Perry  Although Bak Toum thought himself a true sorcerer, he was really  only a very minor devil. In his day, the old arts were mostly forgotten.  Only a pale shadow of the original spectacular evil still lingered on in  the world. And so Bak Toum and his wife, I Tarn, were obliged to live  in greatly reduced circumstances, in a palm-thatched hut on the outskirts of a dirty provincial village, where they furtively attempted to  practice an inferior and much debased species of magic.  As everyone knows, love is a disagreeable and foreign word to  warlocks and demons. For such creatures, happiness springs only  from the delight in evil accomplished; and darkness is their true  habitat. Unfortunately for Bak Toum and I Tarn, each passing year  brought with it an increasingly diminished regard for their ancient  profession and its prerogatives, and, as a result, a steady lessening of  their powers. In fact, things had come to such a pass of late that, even  in such a sleepy backwater as the village where they were now forced  to live, they were actually jeered and laughed at, treated as figures of  fun rather than objects of terror. Because of this, they were, quite  naturally, extremely frustrated and unhappy.  Lacking others on whom to exercise their waning talents, Bak  Toum and I Tarn turned inwards, upon themselves, and vented all the  long years' accumulation of unhappiness and spite on each other, and  spent most of their time bickering and quarrelling. Each thought the  other altogether hideous and revolting, and longed for divorce; but as  each was at the same time still thoroughly frightened of the other,  neither dared to make the first move in this direction. And so, as the  days went by, their disputes grew progressively worse in ferocity and  bitterness; until finally the situation had deteriorated to such an extent  that their neighbors were frequently forced to intervene between them,  to keep them from further violence.  At this time, in a great walled city some distance away from the  village, there lived a king who was exceedingly young and handsome.  Tales of his grace and ability were told throughout the country, and  1 	asu06600000330003001							68046120 Bytes	3902	5811	1611427798	RGB	8	600	asu06600000330003001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1461	1461	1462.jp2	/asu0660/image/1462.jp2
Bak Toum and I Tam					Perry, Ronald, 1932-																											asu0660000033	word of his extraordinary beauty was on every lip and tongue. In her  loathing for her husband, I Tarn repeated these tales to herself frequently and in secret; and conjured up the king's face in dreams; and  imagined herself sitting in splendor on a jeweled peacock throne beside him, or, perfumed and nested in flowers, waiting in a great golden  bed for his coming.  One day, word came to the village that the young king had now  chosen a bride; and that this princess, who was the daughter of a great  king from a neighboring country, and reputedly as beautiful as the  king was handsome, was even now encamped with her train outside  the gates of the city, waiting for the most propitious moment to make  her entry.  At this news, I Tarn was furious. As the smoke rose stinking from  her cooking fire, and the scrawny chickens picked and scrabbled in the  dirt floor of the hut around her, she saw her dreams suddenly collapsing. All the long years of the future stretched out before her, as barren  and bleak as a desert; and she saw herself endlessly wrinkling and  shrinking, imprisoned for life in the same windless dry cage as the husband she detested.  That night, after an especially bitter quarrel with Bak Toum, I  Tarn lay in her bed like a stone, unable to sleep. Her head spun dizzily  with elaborate schemes and speculations; and through her closed eyelids gold glinted and beckoned. Finally, near midnight, she could  stand it no longer. Without making a sound, she arose from her bed  and crept out of the hut into the breathing silence of the forest. And  then, by her arts, she passed swiftly and invisibly through rain-thicket  and across river, down gully and over and under hill, until she came in  the small hours to the camp of the princess before the gates of the  great city.  Moving unseen between the sentries and the pitched tents of the  princess's attendants and swordsmen, I Tarn made her witch's way  into the silk pavilion where the young bride-to-be lay sleeping; and  bent over her; and breathed her black breath into her face; and made  in the air above her a curious ritual gesture she had almost forgotten.  Then she took up the princess's silver mirror and, holding it in front  of the sleeping girl, pronounced some words in an unknown tongue.  As she did so, the princess's image in the mirror began to cloud and  darken; and suddenly she vanished; and the mirror was empty; and  darkness lay in her bed like a collapsed and empty garment.  When the princess had disappeared, I Tarn turned the mirror to  her own wrinkled and ugly witch's face, and looked deeply into it,  murmuring an incantation and crossing her toes and her fingers. As  she looked, the image began to change. One by one, the wrinkles fell 	asu06600000330004001							66555624 Bytes	3884	5710	3114815746	RGB	8	600	asu06600000330004001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1462	1462	1463.jp2	/asu0660/image/1463.jp2

Bak Toum and I Tam					Perry, Ronald, 1932-																											asu0660000033	away like the dead scales of a snake's skin, and in a very short time I  Tarn was transformed into a beautiful young girl, identical in every respect to the vanished princess.  The next morning, I Tarn arose from the princess's bed, and arrayed herself in rich brocade and jeweled stuffs and fine linen, in preparation for her triumphal entry into the king's city. Then, when the  astrologers announced that the most favorable moment was at hand,  she sat back languidly among the silk cushions in the princess's sedan-  chair, and bowed graciously in all directions to the cheering crowds as  the procession moved through the gates of the city and up the royal  way to the palace.  After the marriage had been celebrated, with great pomp and  splendor, the king and his new queen, in accordance with the custom  of the country, withdrew from the world and one another, into private  chambers which had been prepared for them, to spend the prescribed  seven days of solitary fasting and meditation.  Like all sorceresses, however, I Tarn very soon tired of her own  company, and grew very hungry and thirsty. By the evening of the second day, the thirst for blood was so strong upon her that she paced the  floor of her room like a caged animal, writhing in inner torment, unable to stop her hands from shaking, or her mouth from continually  opening and closing. Finally, towards midnight, she could contain  herself no longer. With great stealth and cunning, she crept out of her  chamber, and prowled like a hunting cat down the halls and passageways of the palace, until she came eventually upon a guard who sat  sleeping at his post, with his head back and his mouth wide open.  Now nearly beside herself with thirst and hunger, I Tarn sprang  upon the sleeping guard with all her claws unsheathed; and bit a great  gaping hole in the soft part of his exposed throat; and avidly drank her  fill of his rich, warm blood. And then, satiated, confident that she had  gone unobserved, she ran back to her room and immediately fell into a  deep sleep from which she did not awake until mid-morning.  Twice more, during the course of the succeeding four days, this  process was repeated. On the fourth, and again on the sixth day, the  fever mounted in I Tarn until she could stand it no longer, but had to  creep out, as before, and prowl the sleeping corridors of the palace until she found another guard upon whom she could slake her thirst.  Finally, on the morning of the eighth day, the ritual period of solitary meditation and fasting came to an end for the young king and his  new queen. And the royal handmaidens came in to I Tarn; and put on  her the dress of a queen; and crowned her with gold and young leaves  and flowers; and led her forth into the great hall of the palace. There,  she was presented with all due ceremony to the king her husband; and 	asu06600000330006001							67470152 Bytes	3910	5750	351723874	RGB	8	600	asu06600000330006001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1464	1464	1465.jp2	/asu0660/image/1465.jp2

Bak Toum and I Tam					Perry, Ronald, 1932-																											asu0660000033	the end of their fast was celebrated in great splendor, amidst general  festivity and rejoicing.  During the course of the banquet, the king, seated on his high  throne with his beautiful queen beside him, saw that several of his  chief ministers seemed greatly disturbed, despite the smile they put on  for the benefit of the assembled company. As soon as the feast had  ended, therefore, he called them to him, and asked them what was the  matter, that they should be so sorely troubled at his wedding banquet.  Kneeling before the king and queen, the ministers said that, each  night for the past six nights, while the king and his bride kept fast and  meditated alone in their rooms, a ravening wild beast had somehow  managed to penetrate the walls of the city, and even into the confines  of the palace itself. With gray heads bowed, they told their lord and  his lady how this beast, despite all their safeguards and precautions,  had each night slain another of the palace guards; and this in the most  terrible manner imaginable, ripping and tearing with claw and fang.  But, worst of all, they said, was their fear that the beast was not a true  or natural animal, but a sorcerer; for on each occasion one or more  members of the household had observed a strange shadowy shape flitting or loping about the deserted halls in the middle of the night; and  sometimes this apparition took a woman's shape, and sometimes a  man's.  At this, both the king and the queen gasped, almost in unison, and  turned pale. The ministers stepped politely back, and waited a moment before continuing their story. In any event, they said, how else  could such a creature's presence be explained? Surely, no mere beast  of the jungle could pass through solid walls and come unseen even into  the innermost parts of the palace?  When the ministers finished their tale, they watched, somewhat bewildered, as the king and his wife, their faces the color of ashes, slowly  turned to look at one another. And then the ministers fell back in utter  confusion, hardly believing their eyes as the queen, rising to her feet,  gave a great piercing cry, like that of a mortally wounded animal, and  sprang at the king with her soft, white hands outstretched and curved  like claws.  "Bak Toum!" she cried, "Bak Toum! Foul! Foul!"—whereupon  the ministers, thinking that the queen had suddenly taken leave of her  wits, leapt to the king's aid, only to fall back in even greater confusion  as the king in his turn sprang to his feet and grappled with his  beautiful bride, crying in a loud voice that rang throughout the hall,  "I Tarn! Sly toad! Snake! Slinker!"  And then, before their eyes, the king and queen, locked in one another's arms and biting and spitting and clawing like two wild beasts, 	asu06600000330008001							66352604 Bytes	3862	5725	4176244690	RGB	8	600	asu06600000330008001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1466	1466	1467.jp2	/asu0660/image/1467.jp2

Their beauty, which only a moment before had  seemed so dazzling and spectacular, sagged and ran, dissolving all at  once like dung in a heavy rain; and they were revealed as hideous and  incredibly old, with gnarled and wrinkled skin and broken mouths.  The ministers were so astonished that they still stood, with mouths  wide open and eyes popping, as the guards came running with drawn  swords; and the sorcerer and his screeching harridan wife took to their  witch's heels and fled from the palace and the city like a noisome  wind.  When Bak Toum and I Tarn returned to their village, still snarling  and spitting at each other in their frustration and rage, all the villagers  groaned in unison; for they had already congratulated themselves on  being well-rid of the unpleasant pair. After a time, however, when the  sorcerer and his wife were once again settled in their dirty palm-  thatched hut on the outskirts of the village, and the noise of their perpetual bickering and quarrelling once again could be heard throughout the vicinity, the villagers shrugged their shoulders; and thought  that life, after all, really had very few surprises to offer; and bent their  backs once more to their ploughs.  Ronald Perry was born in Miami in 1932, but spent most of his childhood  in Key Largo where his parents owned and operated a commercial fishing  lodge. He studied at the University of Miami, which he left in 1954 having  completed an M.A. in English Literature and History. After a brief stay at the  University of Iowa, he began a period of travelling which eventually brought  him to Vientiane, Laos, where he worked as secretary for an engineering firm  in the uneasy years between the French withdrawal and the American occupation. Laos made a profound impression on Perry's imagination, inspiring  many of his poems and a series of Laotian tales freely adapted into English,  The City of the Sandalwood Forest. Several of these tales were printed in The  Hudson Review. Bak Toum and I Tarn, with original illustrations by Laurence  Donovan, is printed here for the first time. In 1959 Perry published his first  volume of poetry, Rock Harbor, also illustrated by Donovan, with Alan  Swallow in Denver. Two chapbooks of poems, The Fire Nursery and The Pipe  Smokers, were published in association with the University of Miami English  Department, the latter illustrated by a University of Miami student, James  Moffitt. Voyages from Troy, a mythological sequence of poems with illustrations by Donovan, was published by the Mariner Press, Miami, in 1962. In  1981, Denizens, selected for the National Poetry Series by Donald Justice, appeared under the Random House imprint. While preparing a new volume of  poems, In the Smoke, Perry died in Nassau on July 13, 1982. 	asu06600000330010001							66462068 Bytes	3884	5702	2503339015	RGB	8	600	asu06600000330010001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1468	1468	1469.jp2	/asu0660/image/1469.jp2

Cicada's Faint Rattle / The Sunflower					Montale, Eugenio, 1896-1981																											asu0660000033	Cicada's Faint Rattle  by Eugenio Montale  Cicada's faint rattle  lost on the wind,  scarcely touched and exhausted  in the exhaling torpor.  Deeper inside us  branches the secret  vein; our world  scarcely rules itself.  If you notice, the grey air  trembles with the corrupt  vestiges  that the world does not swallow.  The sign annuls itself,  each voice falls silent.  And a barren life  descends to its last exit.  (translated by John Paul Russo)  The Sunflower  by Eugenio Montale  Bring me the sunflower to transplant it where  the salt wind has burned the ground,  and all day before the sky's reflecting blues  may it show its anxious yellow face.  The darkest things incline to clarity,  and bodies wear down to flows of color,  colors to harmonies. This vanishing  contains the chance of chances.

For a time the cries are over,  only there a house whispers;  under wings sleep the nests,  like eyes under eyelids.  From the open chalices pours  the fragrance of strawberry.  A light shines in a room there.  Grass springs by the tombs.  A tardy bee murmurs, perhaps  the cells are already taken.  The hen struts in the blue yard1  followed by a starry chirping.  Through the night there breathes  a fragrance passing on wind;  a light floats up the stairs,  burns on a floor, and goes out.  It's dawn, the petals close,  a little crumpled. There hides  in the soft and secret urn  I don't know what happiness.  1hen: "rustic name for the Pleiades" (Pascoli)  (translated by John Paul Russo)  11 	asu06600000330013001							67376772 Bytes	3904	5751	444483984	RGB	8	600	asu06600000330013001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1471	1471	1472.jp2	/asu0660/image/1472.jp2
Last Dream					Pascoli, Giovanni, 1855-1912																											asu0660000033	Last Dream  by Giovanni Pascoli  From a motionless rankling clangor  of iron wagons heading for the infinite,  amid piercing shock and savage roar  ... a sudden silence. I was healed.  The stormcloud of illness was lifted  by a breath. A movement of eyelids,  and I saw my mother at my bedside.  I looked at her without surprise.  Free! . . . yes, and still, perhaps,  wishing to drop my hands from my chest,  and not wishing to. One heard a rustling,  thin, persistent, easy like cypresses,  even as a river in a prairie  thirsting for the sea's existlessness.  I listened to its hollow murmuring,  softly similar, always, farther, always.

Notes to St. Elizabeths					Casillo, Robert																											asu0660000033	Notes to St. Elizabeths  by Robert Casillo  Line 6: "quick hands, feeding squirrels and poets," During his  confinement for insanity at St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington  (1946-1958), Pound often fed the squirrels while relaxing on the hospital lawn. He remembers these squirrels in Canto 116, p. 796: "to be  saved by squirrels and blue jays?" While at the hospital Pound also  received abundant amounts of food from visitors, so much, in fact,  that he frequently gave the food away to hungry and aspiring poets in  his retinue. (All references to The Cantos in these notes are taken from  the 1972 edition of The Cantos of Ezra Pound published by New Directions, New York.)  Lines 9-10: "Directio voluntatis—/ His life's key-words." Deriving from Dante, this favorite phrase of Pound's means "direction of  the will" and receives a Confucian coloring in his works. As a volun-  tarist Pound believes as does Confucius that human evil traces not to  original sin or the innate depravity of man but to "error," whose  cause lies in the failure or corruption of the will. The proper remedy  for a corrupted will is therefore not punishment but rather the direction of the will through education, the cultivation of right reason. For  Pound the Christian doctrine of original sin is a false Hebraic engraft-  ment upon the basically pagan optimism and naturalism of the West.  Line 14: "Make it New" The title of this book, published in 1934, is  a favorite and famous Poundian slogan which appears in his works in  a variety of contexts. In one sense this is an injunction to renovate cultural forms and models, to strike an ideal balance between artistic  originality and tradition; a counter-Romantic, Pound never valued  absolute originality or originality for its own sake. This phrase also  implies the need for ritual as a means of casting off the detritus of the  past and of harmonizing culture with the ever-renewing cycles of  nature. In Canto 54, p. 265, the Chinese Emperor Tsching "prayed on  the mountain and / wrote MAKE IT NEW / on his bath tub / Day by  day make it new / cut underbrush, / pile the logs / keep it growing."  Lines 15-16: "A spermy book. Yes, spermatazoa / Oozed out of  every cranial pore." In his Postscript to Remy de Gourmont's Natural  Philosophy of Love (1922), Pound speculates that the (male) brain  may consist of coagulated sperm originally transmitted to the skull via  the spinal cord. He then goes on to speak of the "integration of the  male in the phallus" and to suggest the interchangeability of sperm,  light, and the creative artistic intelligence; saturated with light and  language as with sperm and thought, the artist's brain has the power  of "exteriorising forms" as does a spermatazoa. These speculations  17 	asu06600000330019001							66087600 Bytes	3856	5711	2210435856	RGB	8	600	asu06600000330019001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1477	1477	1478.jp2	/asu0660/image/1478.jp2
Notes to St. Elizabeths					Casillo, Robert																											asu0660000033	are in part inspired by Pound's sensation of "driving" himself like a  phallus into the "passive vulva of London" in an attempt to shape the  "female chaos" of English civilization. They may also be the basis for  Gaudier-Brzeska's famous head of Pound in the form of a marble  phallus. Put simply, Pound thinks of great literature and art as foci  and transmitters of vital and even sexual energy. Their "spermatic  logoi [words]" radiate seminal light and so fecundate other minds. See  Pound, Pavannes and Divagations (New York: New Directions,  1958), pp. 209-210; Guide to Kulchur (New York: New Directions,  1970), p. 128; Charles Norman, Ezra Pound (New York: MacMillan,  I960), p. 136.  Line 23: "Hang it all, Ezra Loomis Pound," Pound's Canto 2  opens by raising the question of the historical authenticity of Browning's treatment of the eponymous hero of his poem Sordello: "Hang it  all, Robert Browning, / there can be but the one "Sordello." / But  Sordello, and my Sordello?" (Canto 2, p. 6) Loomis is the name of  Pound's paternal grandmother's family, which derived from upper  New York State. An old lady from the region once told Pound that the  Loomises were fine people, but horse thieves—a story which Pound  was fond of repeating. See Noel Stock, The Life of Ezra Pound (New  York: Avon, 1970), pp. 20-21.  Lines 27-28: "Rooseveltian views / About the war." Where  Roosevelt and the Allies believed that World War II had to be fought  in order to stop the spread of Fascist aggression against the Western  democracies, Pound believed that the Fascist nations had had no  choice but to join in war against what Hitler termed "Liehkapital"  (Loan Capital), an international conspiracy of finance capital  centered in England and America. According to Pound in the radio  broadcasts and elsewhere, not only had the usurocracy fomented  World War II (in order to reap vast profits from the interest on debts),  but it had gained political control over London and Washington.  Although Pound does not consider this conspiracy to be composed exclusively of Jews, he is certain that they hold a prominent and essential  place within it. England has become an outpost of "Judea," while  Roosevelt's Brain Trust speaks "almost Yiddish," and Roosevelt  himself is the architect of the "new Jew Roosevelt oosalem." See  Pound, "Ezra Pound Speaking": Radio Speeches of World War II,  ed. Leonard W. Doob (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1978),  pp. 59, 148, 228.  Lines 28-29: "You were (they said) insane, / A Fascist, anti-Jew,"  "They" probably refers to the liberal press and the American public,  which generally condemned Pound's poetry and politics and offered  them as evidence of his insanity.

Notes to St. Elizabeths					Casillo, Robert																											asu0660000033	Elizabeths, has recently shown that Pound was almost certainly not  insane (and that he was therefore fit to stand trial for treason); the  questionable diagnosis of insanity was maintained by Dr. Winfred  Overholser, superintendent of St. Elizabeths, who loved literature and  wished to protect Pound. Meantime, the question of Pound's anti-  Semitism is extremely complicated and has not yet received satisfactory treatment. Critics often argue that Pound was anti-Semitic in  neither the racial (biological) nor the cultural sense, and that he confined his hatred to a number of vicious usurers who just happened to  be Jewish. This argument by no means explains Pound's attacks on  "Jewry" in the broadcasts or his enthusiastic endorsement of Nazi  eugenic policies; if anything Pound's prose reveals an increasingly  transparent hatred towards not just Jews but the entire Semitic world.  As for his Fascism, during his trial Pound jumped up and shouted  "I am not a Fascist." On other occasions Pound showed his inveterate  suspicion of abstraction by implying that the general concept  "Fascist" was inadequate to define the ideology of an individual as  I unique as himself. Pound critics have also pointed out that, though  Pound supported Mussolini's "corporate state" in Jefferson and/or  Mussolini (1935), in that work he views Fascism as foreign to  American and Anglo-Saxon traditions, and therefore does not advocate it for "export" to the United States. Even so, by the 'forties  broadcasts Pound's commitment to the Italian Fascist ideology is  stronger than ever, and indeed he tells the United States that its only  hope is a "corporate solution" in the sense then current in Europe.  See Torrey, "The Protection of Ezra Pound," Psychology Today  (Nov., 1981); Frederick Wertham, "Road to Rapallo: A Psychiatric  Study," The American Journal of Psychotherapy, 3 (1949), 585-600;  Leon Surette, A Light from Eleusis (New York: Oxford University  Press, 1979), p. 5; Christine Brooke-Rose, A ZBC of Ezra Pound  (Berkeley; University of California Press, 1971), p. 250; Pound, Jefferson and/or Mussolini (New York: Liveright, 1935), p. 98; "Ezra  Pound Speaking" pp. 310, 131-132, 155, 140, 22; Julian Cornell, The  Trial of Ezra Pound (New York: John Day, 1966), p. 192.  Line 30: "traitor to the Fatherland." Having made hundreds of  pro-Fascist broadcasts over Rome radio between 1941 and 1945, in the  spring of 1945 Pound was captured by the Allies, charged with treason  by the U.S., and confined for several months to the U.S. Army  Disciplinary Training Center at Pisa, where he wrote the Pisan Cantos  and suffered a severe mental and physical collapse. In February, 1946  Pound escaped trial for treason in Washington by successfully entering a plea of insanity and, after thirteen years of confinement at St.  Elizabeths, in April, 1958 he was finally released and left the United  19 	asu06600000330021001							67292124 Bytes	3888	5767	3062644246	RGB	8	600	asu06600000330021001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1479	1479	1480.jp2	/asu0660/image/1480.jp2
Notes to St. Elizabeths					Casillo, Robert																											asu0660000033	States without ever having stood trial. Although recent research has  raised serious doubts about Pound's insanity, under these circum-  tances there is no legal justification for referring to Pound as a traitor  to the United States. Some critics, Emery among them, believe that  the Federal government would have had extreme difficulty in convicting Pound of treason, since conviction would have required proof of  intent, and Pound had frequently expressed his loyalty to American  principles in his radio broadcasts. On Pound's imprisonment at Pisa  and his St. Elizabeths years, see Stock, The Life of Ezra Pound, pp.  516-574. See also E. Fuller Torrey, "The Mad Days of Ezra Pound,"  Esquire (August, 1983), 86-92.  Lines 44-45: "no mask / (Persona, if you wish) to hide behind."  An allusion to Pound's tendency in his early poetry to write not in his  own lyric voice but rather to adopt the persona or mask of another, to  speak in a voice other than his own; his 1909 volume of poems, as well  as his early collected poems, are entitled Personae. Pound's career  reveals the gradual thinning out of these personae and his assumption  of his own voice throughout most of The Cantos.  Lines 48-49: "dance of intellect eurhythmic (Duncan / Second-  best to him)." Presumably an allusion to Isadora Duncan, the  American pioneer in modern dance. By implication Pound becomes  the greatest American "dancer."  Lines 49-50: "Some frost-is-on-the-punkin / Hoosierisms now and  then," This alludes to Pound's anti-pedantic affectation of a  Midwestern crackerbarrel style of speech, one of the many regional  accents which Pound adopted in his radio broadcasts in an attempt to  appeal to native American listeners (and also to conceal his essential  cosmopolitanism). Noel Stock suggests that in his early youth Pound  was familiar with and fond of the colloquial and regional manner of  the Indiana or "Hoosier" poet James Whitcomb Riley; the poem  which Stock attributes to Pound contains references to Thanksgiving,  turkey, and Jack Frost. Riley's influence can also be felt in Pound's  translations of some of the folksongs in his version of the Chinese  Book of Odes (the Confucian Odes). See Stock, The Life of Ezra  Pound, pp. 72, 37; Norman, Ezra Pound, p. 387.  Line 59: "of troubadours and Dante" A passionate admirer of  Dante and the troubadours from the very beginning of his career,  Pound is one of the major modern interpreters of these poets to the  Anglo-Saxon world. Their influence is constantly evident in Pound's  poetry and prose. For a discussion of these poets, see Pound, Literary  Essays, ed. T. S. Eliot (London: Faber and Faber, 1954), pp. 201-213;  The Spirit of Romance (New York: New Directions, 1968), pp.  87-100, 118-185.  20 	asu06600000330022001							68323224 Bytes	3956	5755	2213048044	RGB	8	600	asu06600000330022001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1480	1480	1481.jp2	/asu0660/image/1481.jp2
Notes to St. Elizabeths					Casillo, Robert																											asu0660000033	Line 63: "beanery." This is Pound's irreverent term for the American university and especially its graduate school. Having studied  Romance literature briefly in the graduate school of the University of  Pennsylvania, Pound became convinced over his career that the  American universities were nests of pedantry, obfuscation, and intellectual and moral cowardice. The derivation of "beanery" is uncertain but may derive from the American colloquialism "bean," for  head. For Pound's most sustained and eloquent attack on the  dehumanizing effects of the "Germanic" or modern ideal of scholarship, see "Provincialism the Enemy," in Selected Prose, pp. 189-203.  Line 67: "Been treated like the bad thief on the cross" This  perhaps alludes to the Pisan Cantos, written during Pound's confinement at the U.S. Army Disciplinary Center in Pisa, and in which  Pound portrays himself as a sacrificial victim. In Canto 74, p. 427,  Pound seems to identify himself with Barabbas, the thief who succeeded in escaping crucifixion at Calvary; but later in this canto  Pound seems to dissociate himself from Barabbas and to invite a comparison between himself and Christ: "with Barabbas and his two  thieves beside me" (Canto 74, p. 436).  Line 70: "unwobbling pivot." This alludes to the Chung Yung of  Confucius, which Pound translated as The Unwobbling Pivot.  According to Pound, this work contains the "Confucian  metaphysics": "what exists plumb in the middle"—namely the unwobbling pivot—"is the just process of the universe and that which  never wavers or wobbles is the calm principle operant in its mode of  action." Emery implies, then, that Pound has aligned himself with the  unchanging axis of the universe and its principle of justice. Pound's  Italian translation of the Chung Yung, entitled L'Asse che non  Vacilla, was confiscated after World War II by the Allies on the suspicion that the asse (axis) of the title had to do with Fascism. While  Pound critics have sometimes chided the U.S. government for its ignorance of Confucius, in actuality Pound draws repeated parallels in  The Cantos and in his critical prose between Fascist and Confucian  order, and the play on asse-Ax\s is no doubt intentional. See Pound,  Confucius (New York: New Directions, 1969), pp. 95, 97. On L'Asse  che non Vacilla, see Wendy Flory, Ezra Pound and The Cantos: The  Record of a Struggle (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1980), p. 25;  Stock, The Life of Ezra Pound, p. 523; Massimo Bacigalupo, The  Formed Trace: The Later Poetry of Ezra Pound (New York: Columbia University Press, 1980), p. 184n.  Line 74: "Metamorphosing chicken into vulture," Probably an  allusion to Pound's lasting interest in Ovid and especially metamorphosis. Apart from his frequent representation of moments of sudden  21 	asu06600000330023001							66642216 Bytes	3864	5747	3614107302	RGB	8	600	asu06600000330023001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1481	1481	1482.jp2	/asu0660/image/1482.jp2
Notes to St. Elizabeths					Casillo, Robert																											asu0660000033	physical and mental transformation in his early poetry, Pound defines  metamorphosis as one of the three most important themes or "subjects" of The Cantos: "'The magic moment' or moment of metamorphosis, bust thru from quotidian into 'divine or permanent world.'  Gods, etc." The idea of metamorphosis may also underlie Pound's  idea of the ideogram. See Pound, The Letters of Ezra Pound, ed.  D.D. Paige (New York: Harcourt, Brace, and Co., 1950), p. 210.  Line 75: "not cult-yure nor Kultur but Kulchur." A series of  Poundian discriminations among kinds of culture and education.  Pound rejects the first two, endorses and promotes the third. As its affected pronunciation implies, "cult-yure" stands for the stuffily  genteel high culture, characterized by social and aesthetic snobbery,  fear and hatred of energy and innovation, and the worship of an embalmed tradition. The second is (for Pound at least) the cultural ideal  of the centralized and imperialistic German state of the late nineteenth  and early twentieth century. Deeply fearful of "Prussianism," Pound  decries Germany's compartmentalization of disciplines in the state-  controlled universities and the state's appropriation of German  culture for purposes of political propaganda. Still more dangerous is  Germany's use of military might to impose its culture or "Kultur" on  other European nations — a violation of Pound's cosmopolitan conception of European civilization. Pound's alternative to these conceptions of culture is the irreverently spelled "Kulchur." Far from being  confined to elitist and high cultural manifestations in art and  literature, "Kulchur" encompasses science and myth, folklore and  ritual, indeed anything that is living, valuable, and useful in the  cultural traditions of mankind. In Guide to Kulchur Pound virtually  equates it with his idea of the "Paideuma," which consists of those  often ignored but powerful "gristly roots of ideas" that continue to  go into "action." See Pound, Selected Prose, pp. 189-203; Guide to  Kulchur, passim.  Line 94: "One can't in these days do the Milton thing" Pound's  bete noir among his poetic predecessors was John Milton, whom he  disliked for his Latinate diction, rhetorical manner, unnatural grammatical inversions, and lack of concrete visual imagery. For Pound,  Milton is much inferior to Dante, whom Pound offers as a lasting  model for poetic clarity, distinctness, and precision. For Pound contra  Milton and pro Dante, see Literary Essays, pp. 216, 217, 237-238, 7,  154, 201.  Lines 95-96: "Begin, and somewhat loudly sweep the string,/  Begin, then, Sisters of the sacred well" See Milton, Lycidas, 11. 17, 15.  Line 97: "Pentamenters are busted all to hell."

Like many modern poets, but with greater  daring and more remarkable results, Pound believed the iambic pentameter to have become virtually exhausted for expressive purposes.  As a poet one of Pound's greatest achievements is in having supplied a  variety of metrical alternatives to the iambic norm through the combination of dactyls, trochees, spondees, and great number of metrical  patterns derived from classical poetry. Pound at once states and  demonstrates his metrical principles in The Pisan Cantos: "To break  the pentamenter, that was the first heave." See Canto 81, p. 518.  Line 100: "La Martinelli," E. Torrey has recently shown that  Pound was granted extraordinary freedom at St. Elizabeths by the  hospital's superintendent, Dr. Winfred Overholser, Sr. Sherri Martinelli was an American painter who became Pound's regular companion at St. Elizabeths until she was displaced in Pound's affections in  1957 by Marcella Spann. Described by Noel Stock as a "strange,  rather scatterbrained young woman," in 1956 Martinelli or La Martinelli as she called herself published a booklet which contained  reproductions of her paintings along with an introduction by Pound;  her portrait of Pound is reproduced in his translation of Sophocles'  Women of Trachis. She also appears in the Rock-Drill Cantos as "Undine" and is believed to have inspired Canto 90.

Letters of Ezra Pound to Clark Emery in the University of Miami Library					Casillo, Robert																											asu0660000033	Letters of Ezra Pound to Clark Emery  In the University of Miami Library  by Robert Casillo  The most sensational literary career of this century is surely that of  Ezra Pound, one of the greatest modern American poets. A self-styled  "exile" from America in 1908, Pound launched his career in London,  where talent and ambition quickly made him one of the most familiar  figures on the Edwardian literary scene. Thanks to his extension and  purification of modern poetic diction, his daring experiments in  rhythm and meter, and his revivifying translations of Greek, Italian,  and Chinese classics, Pound won the title of "inventor" of modern  poetry in our time. Yet Pound was no less important to modern letters  in his permanent role of instigator, organizer, and publicist of innovative talent. Before World War I Pound was a central figure in the  Imagist and Vorticist movements, and he promoted the work of James  Joyce, T. S. Eliot, Wyndham Lewis, Robert Frost, and William  Carlos Williams. After the war Pound continued to break new  ground. Having abandoned London and Paris for the Italian seacoast  town of Rapallo, Pound was already at work on his encyclopedic  "modern epic," The Cantos. Left unfinished at Pound's death in  1972, this work combines myth and history, science and legend, lyric  and anecdote, all in an attempt to encompass the whole range of  human experience, the "undying constants" in human nature. The  Cantos are among the best-known, least read, and most important  books of the twentieth century.  Nonetheless, the poetic achievement of Ezra Pound has always  been shadowed, at least in the public mind, by notoriety and even  disgrace. His Cantos bear the heavy imprint of the economic obsession which Pound began to manifest in the 1920's and which persisted  into his old age. Convinced that the West is under the control of a far-  flung financial conspiracy in which Jews play a prominent role, Pound  advocated monetary reform of various sorts as an antidote to international loan capital or "usury." By the 1930's Pound had come to support Italian Fascism, which he saw as the instrument of his economic  and cultural values, and during the war years Pound delivered his pro-  Axis broadcasts to the United States over Rome Radio. Along with  Pound's familiar artistic and cultural themes, these broadcasts endorse anti-Semitism, Fascist corporatism, and Nazi eugenics.

Letters of Ezra Pound to Clark Emery in the University of Miami Library					Casillo, Robert																											asu0660000033	of these excesses, immediately after the war Pound was imprisoned in  the U.S. Army Disciplinary Camp at Pisa, where he spent several  agonized months in solitary confinement. These months also saw the  writing of the Pisan Cantos, for many critics the summit of Pound's  poetic achievement. Then, in November, 1945, Pound was  transported to Washington to stand trial for treason. But apparently  the U.S. government wanted to avoid the embarrassment of hanging  one of the nation's greatest literary figures. Though Pound was  almost certainly fit to stand trial, his insanity plea was successful. He  was therefore confined in December, 1945 to St. Elizabeths Hospital,  an insane asylum in Washington, D.C. Pound remained there until his  release in 1958, after which, the charge of treason having been  dropped, Pound departed for Italy and his son-in-law's castle in the  Italian Tyrol.  A less indomitable person than Pound would have collapsed under  so many years of mental strain and ignominy. Whatever one may  think of Pound's politics, one can only admire the energy and resourcefulness with which he turned his St. Elizabeths years into some  of the most brilliantly productive of his career. At St. Elizabeths  Pound completed two major sections of The Cantos and some major  translations of Chinese and Greek classics. He also continued his political propagandizing, often pseudonomously and in obscure extreme  right-wing journals, while carrying on a typically voluminous, wide-  ranging, and exhausting correspondence; its topics range from poetry  to philosophy, economics to religion, anthropology to politics. All  this is a testament to Pound's unflagging commitment to that activating knowledge which he termed "Kulchur." Nor did Pound pass  these years apart from intelligent and supportive human contacts.  During visiting hours at St. Elizabeths, Pound conducted a salon frequented by poets, artists, critics, and scholars. To be sure, some of his  visitors were hangers-on and curiosity seekers, and some, such as John  Kasper, were interested only in Pound's incendiary politics. But the  majority no doubt came in search of Pound's wisdom in poetry, art,  history, and numerous other things, the vast panoply of cultural  knowledge which he revealed in his Cantos.  The Archives and Special Collections Department of the University of Miami Library is especially fortunate to have valuable materials  from Pound's St. Elizabeths years: fifty-one letters and six postcards  from Ezra Pound to Professor Clark Emery, a member of the University of Miami English Department from 1947 to 1975. In the early  1950's Professor Emery was working on a full-length study of The  Cantos, which at that time were only beginning to receive serious  scholarly examination, and whose main themes and devices were  25 	asu06600000330027001							66106528 Bytes	3845	5729	2046814029	RGB	8	600	asu06600000330027001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1485	1485	1486.jp2	/asu0660/image/1486.jp2
Letters of Ezra Pound to Clark Emery in the University of Miami Library					Casillo, Robert																											asu0660000033	largely a mystery. Emery began his correspondence with Pound by  asking about the fine points of Pound's poetic "arcanum." But  Pound, eager not simply to help Emery write his book but to draw an  enthusiastic supporter into the Poundian fold, was soon enough calling Emery "Em" and instructing him in a great variety of pet subjects: the state of education and the curriculum especially, cultural activism, pedagogical methods, the poetic abilities of the younger  generation (Emery's students, in fact), the political importance of the  radio .... Nor was Emery spared Pound's reiteration of his economic  and political creeds.  Beginning in September, 1951, and concluding in 1961, three years  after Pound's departure for Italy, this correspondence is punctuated  by such high points as the day (April 13, 1953) on which Pound gave  Emery permission to visit him at St. Elizabeths; one can only imagine  the emotional effect of such a summons. Emery visited Pound in  Washington on a number of occasions, at least once with a busload of  University of Miami students whom Pound entertained on the St.  Elizabeths lawn, and he commemorated these visits in a poem published in this issue of The Carrell. Another high point for Emery must  have been the day on which Pound congratulated him after having  read his manuscript on The Cantos. He had shown, Pound said of  Emery's work, "the most careful and thorough drive to correlate results of 50 years work." Pound's judgement was vindicated in 1958  when the University of Miami Press published Emery's Ideas into Action: A Study of Ezra Pound's Cantos. To this day the conclusions of  this study hold after twenty-five years of unremitting research on  Pound. Allen Ginsberg was right in observing in the Poundian journal  Paideuma that Ideas into Action is perhaps the best introduction to  The Cantos and particularly to their economic themes.  If Pound's letters to Emery sometimes seem obscure even to the informed reader, this is in large part because the University Library  lacks Emery's letters to Pound, which would help to clarify the subjects under discussion; Emery's letters are part of the extensive Pound  Collection at the Beinecke Library at Yale. As a further obstacle to  understanding there is Pound's rapid, abrupt, and telegraphic style; in  these letters as elsewhere Pound leaps repeatedly from subject to subject in sudden bursts of thought. When he was examined by U.S.  Army psychiatrists after his harrowing stay at the prison camp in Pisa,  they indicated as a sign of his mental unsoundness his "distractabil-  ity," his inability to keep to a single subject. Actually, these discontinuities are typical of Pound's "ideogrammic" manner of thinking and  reflect not only the scope of his intellect but his desire to find hitherto  unsuspected relations among disparate things; at the same time they  26 	asu06600000330028001							67982668 Bytes	3968	5709	3517293077	RGB	8	600	asu06600000330028001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1486	1486	1487.jp2	/asu0660/image/1487.jp2
Letters of Ezra Pound to Clark Emery in the University of Miami Library					Casillo, Robert																											asu0660000033	reflect his emphasis on rapid communication, the mind as light "fighting for speed." This, however, does not often help the reader, to  whom Pound leaves the task of leaping his hiatuses. In reading these  letters one is no less conscious of what T. S. Eliot called Pound's  "peculiar orthography"—colloquial and regional spellings, the use of  capitals to emphasize words and phrases or vocal intonations. In the  first instance these represent Pound's anti-pedantry, his desire to conceal his cosmopolitanism and project a native "murkn" mask. In the  second they bespeak his concern to hierarchize the terms of discourse,  to eliminate needless explanation, to present his "gists" and "piths"  with maximum immediacy, force, and efficiency. Good writing,  Pound believed, should be like "a ball of light in one's hand."  To read these letters is also to feel the irrepressible power of this  charming, generous, humorous, irascible, and explosively violent personality. Famous for having helped and instigated writers throughout  his career, Pound devotes two long letters to a detailed discussion of  Emery's study of Pound's Cantos. In another letter he commiserates  with Emery and "bucks up" his confidence after a publisher had rejected the manuscript. Pound's humor is evident when Emery asks  whether, during Pound's brief period as William Butler Yeats'  secretary, he had seen any supernatural visions (Yeats was interested  in magic and the supernatural): "no entanglement wiff YeATS's  spooks, leprechauns, hokum artists, etc." But as Pound's broadcasts  and published correspondence reveal, he can also be violent and brutal  in his language. Disgusted (as usual) with the Democratic party and  especially with the New Deal, Pound links its members to the "power  of evil" and declares that Wilson and F. D. R. deserve "the bottom of  hell as a mild form of justice." Here is the poet who—to quote  Eliot—fabricates Hells for "other people." Although Pound labels  his violent language an "emotional reaction" rather than a "durable  conviction," in the same letter his bile rises again and he wants the  chance to kick Roosevelt "in the stomach."  It is well known that Pound's poetic career reveals a constant expansion of technical means and historical interest, but in many ways  he is an obsessive and hence repetitious writer, and it is no surprise  that these letters reiterate old themes. Of these, the best known is  Pound's opposition to usury, which is the taking of interest at exorbitant rates, and which by around 1930 Pound came to view as the  greatest of evils. Emery's correspondence with Pound in fact coincides  with Pound's attainment of what he considered a satisfactory definition of usury. Appended to Canto 45, the first of three major Cantos  devoted exclusively to the nature of usury, the definition reads: "A  charge for the use of purchasing power, levied without regard to pro-  27 	asu06600000330029001							66594968 Bytes	3868	5737	1849370704	RGB	8	600	asu06600000330029001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1487	1487	1488.jp2	/asu0660/image/1488.jp2
Letters of Ezra Pound to Clark Emery in the University of Miami Library					Casillo, Robert																											asu0660000033	duction, often without regard to the possibilities of production (Hence  the failure of the Medici bank)." Pound believes that history shapes  up as a constant battle between honest "producers" and rapacious  and exploitative usurers, who sabotage production by the manipulation of money and saddle future generations with debts. In order to  eliminate usury, state governments should nationalize banking and  regulate the money supply in order to promote production and consumption.  Here one sees why, in these letters and elsewhere, Pound insists  that the American Constitution has been "betrayed." Roosevelt and  the Democrats have ignored the central importance of "issue" or  monetary policy, above all the constitutional power vested in Congress to place the banking system under national control. Thanks to  these derelictions, and thanks too to their establishment of a quasi-  socialistic welfare state, Roosevelt and company are a "slide greased  with sewage," while America is "going to shit" and the "betrayal of  the Constitution" is "festering in every vein." These statements echo  the Pisan Cantos, where Pound speaks of usurious veleno (poison) in  "all the veins of the commonweal."  Throughout his writing Pound asserts that evil stems not from sin,  which is a false and Hebraic conception, but from man's failure of  will or his "directio voluntatis." Indeed, he tells Emery that usury has  its "root" in an "evil will." But for Pound the remedy for corrupt  volition is not punishment but a Confucian appeal to the reason, a  return to intellectual clarity. Usury, a failure to dissociate true from  false production, is possible only where men, through bad education,  are incapable of making correct intellectual and verbal discriminations. Pound insists that the honest writer has a moral obligation to  marshal his facts and to present them with maximum clarity; the  recognition of good and evil depends on the Confucion Cheng Ming,  the calling of things by their right names. As Pound remarks to  Emery, the "misunderstanding" of his own position "comes from ig-  gurance/refusal to ascertain facts, and to use words with definite  meaning."  Given Pound's insistence on accuracy in representation, one can  understand his lifelong suspicion of symbolism, allegory, metaphor,  or any form of expression which defines one thing in terms of  something else. In 1918 Pound had observed that the "proper and  perfect symbol is the natural object," and that "if a man use 'symbols'  he must so use them that their symbolic function does not obtrude."  Apparently Emery in one of his manuscript passages on The Cantos  had momentarily forgotten this Poundian credo and thus earned the  master's rebuke: "If you had never heard of SYMbology yr/mind  28 	asu06600000330030001							67421724 Bytes	3927	5721	1518401402	RGB	8	600	asu06600000330030001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1488	1488	1489.jp2	/asu0660/image/1489.jp2

Pound also hoped to revitalize American civilization through the  restoration of the classics and a revision of the secondary school and  college curricula. In his early poem "Cantico del Sole," Pound had  said that his sleep had been "troubled" by the thought of what  "America would be like" if the classics had a "wide circulation." The  young Pound had been hoping to set off a true American Risorgi-  mento or Renaissance, a cultural flowering that would "make the  Italian Renaissance look like a tempest in a teapot." Sober-minded  but by no means totally discouraged after his life-long struggle against  Philistinism and commercialism, Pound in the 'fifties is circulating  manifestoes among concerned critics and scholars in support of  classical education in the universities. Unfortunately, he adds, education has declined "since fifty years ago, when colleges required 2  languages/and some sane mathematics." For Pound the Great Books  course popularized by the University of Chicago is at once too bulky,  too conventional, and too full of "trimmings"; he would put the  essential curriculum on "V2 sheet."  This urge to streamline the curriculum ("cast off paraphernalia,"  he advises in Canto 91) calls to mind Pound's experience in the British  Museum in 1908, when he decided that there must be some way of  making efficient use of that vast store of cultural knowledge; his solution was The Cantos, which are a sort of "portable British Museum,"  and in which Pound seeks to unearth and transmit his "Paideuma,"  those "gristly roots of ideas" that go into "action."  Another persistent feature of Pound's pedagogy is his desire to  resurrect neglected texts and even to substitute them in the curriculum  for more familiar classics. "It's good," says Pound, ever on the lookout for unexpected facts and revelations, "to read a few classic  authors NOT recommended by the beaneries [universities]." He recommends to Emery not the enshrined Aquinas but the medieval  philosopher Richard of St. Victor, who writes of the three gradations  of intellectual awareness; not the rationalistic Stoic Marcus Aurelius  but the pagan sage and thaumaturgist Apollonius of Tyana of the first  century A. D., to whom the Greek Philostratus devoted a little known  biography. These writers among many others form the "roots" of  Pound's "Paideuma."  Nonetheless, Pound was aware that no cultural revival, no recovery of "clean" economic or social values, could take place solely  within the library or study; for Pound an idea is "truncated" unless it  goes "into action." His idea of the scholar and man of letters derives  first of all from Confucian China, where the mandarin literati played  29 	asu06600000330031001							66919380 Bytes	3872	5759	913978326	RGB	8	600	asu06600000330031001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1489	1489	1490.jp2	/asu0660/image/1490.jp2
Letters of Ezra Pound to Clark Emery in the University of Miami Library					Casillo, Robert																											asu0660000033	an indispensable role in politics, and secondarily from the Italian  Renaissance, where Latin humanists enjoyed positions of political importance and influenced practical life. One sees here the inspiration  for Pound's excursions into politics, his letters to cabinet ministers  and politicians, his broadcasts, and his visit to Mussolini to advise him  as a Renaissance courtier or humanist might have advised his prince.  Still hoping in the 'fifties for a unified, engaged, and influential  American "intelligentsia," Pound tells Emery that the time to act is  "NOW." "The only REAL help is VIA CONTACTS," but the "goddamn intelligentsia do NOT make effort to contact those in control of  country." Pound then issues this warning from the man who had  sought a Philosopher-King: "even Plato sd/'penalty good men pay  for indifference to gov't'/is to be governed by evil men."  By the 1920's Pound feared that his project of cultural renewal  would be shipwrecked by omnipresent and insuperable obstacles. Repeating a deep grievance from his early days, Pound tells Emery of the  breakup of the London artistic and cultural "vortex" at the hands of  conservative editors and cowardly publishers. After Sir Alfred Mond  had "sacked" Pound's colleague Ford Madox Ford "of the editorship of the English Review," thus committing a "crime against intelligence in England" and the "murder of English literature," the  novelist Wyndham Lewis and Pound founded the avant-garde  magazine Blast as a retaliation. However brilliant, Blast was aborted  after two issues by the outbreak of World War I, and by 1920 Pound  had been blackballed by the leading English literary journals and the  "vortex" had dissipated. By the 1950's Pound's fear of his enemies  had become even stronger and had reached even paranoid proportions. Pound is convinced that usurers control the U.S. government  and that they in alliance with publishers conspire to impede the spread  of essential knowledge of art, history, economics, and politics; their  only purpose is to promote commercialism and vulgarity. As Pound  tells Emery, the West has lived through "centuries of historic  blackout," an effacement of the "historical record" and its  "economic wisdom," so that "Adam Smiff" remains the last word in  economics and hardly anyone has even heard of the money and credit  theories of Major C. H. Douglas and Silvio Gesell. When Pound is  slow in receiving word concerning a translation of Thaddeus  Zielinski's work, in his eyes an elucidation of the cultural origins of  modern scarcity economics, Pound suspects "interference by the  post." When Emery's manuscript is rejected by a publisher, Pound  tells him that he should consider the "OPPOSITION." Nothing can  exceed Pound's "disbelief in the decency" of university presses, and it  is up to Emery to break the "boycott."  30 	asu06600000330032001							66929748 Bytes	3899	5720	4011313000	RGB	8	600	asu06600000330032001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1490	1490	1491.jp2	/asu0660/image/1491.jp2
Letters of Ezra Pound to Clark Emery in the University of Miami Library					Casillo, Robert																											asu0660000033	While Pound is unquestionably a cultural elitist, he also believes  that the ultimate aim of scholarship is "popularization" (without vulgarization and easy simplification), and he especially admires those  periods in which there is little or no distinction between mass and high  culture. But since America is "too squalid to print an information  weekly" of any quality, Pound must content himself with the conscious formation of an informed cultural community on a small scale.  There is no bulwark against confusion, he tells Emery, except the  "correlated opinions of a hundred clean men"; as in the radio broadcasts, the West can be saved only by a "conspiracy" of intelligence. A  rather short step towards these goals was Pound's idea of "In  Circuit," consisting of letters circulating constantly among a select  group of critics, scholars, and artists, each contributing his own information and questions: "failing conversation," Pound observes to  Emery, "epistolary correspondence might revive." Generally, however, Pound prefers not communities of correspondence but even  more tightly-knit cultural communities, the salons of the Enlightenment or the intimate circles of Jefferson and Adams, where extraordinary men of varied cultural attainments rule by "conversation."  This is the kind of cultural community which Pound knew in his London period and which he sought to revive at St. Elizabeths, where he  entertained a constant stream of poets, scholars, artists, critics, and  curiosity seekers. For about twelve years a small corner of an insane  asylum was perhaps the most vital spot, culturally speaking, in  America.  Meanwhile, Pound's example was setting off a small vortex of cultural energy in Miami. Early in their correspondence Pound had told  Emery that "ONLY by collaboration and exchange of information"  could his generation "swim above the sea of SPEW." "There ought  to be in Miami and EVERY town," remarked Pound, "a group of 4  to talk back and forth until the basic lines clarify. That WAS in London 40 years ago." Pound also warned Emery of the increasing  fragmentation of university life as a result of specialization, so that  professors "NEVER know" or even speak "to other members or  faculty of different departments." It was necessary for Emery to seek  contacts across the disciplines, especially in history. Whatever the  result of Emery's forays outside the English department, he did succeed in forming a small but fervent community of Poundophiles  among the university's youthful literati. One of its leading members  was Emery's student, the late poet Ronald Perry, for whose early  poems Pound had some kind words, and who was committed to the  struggle for Pound's release from St. Elizabeths.

Although the master  found Donovan's youthful poems a bit too romantic ("lavender-  scented" Pound called them), Donovan began his career as a Poundo-  phile and has never wavered from that estimation. As for the Pulitzer-  Prize winning poet Donald Justice, a student and teacher at the University of Miami in the 'fifties, he too came within Pound's and Emery's sphere of influence. Among the scholars there was Barbara  Charlesworth, Emery's graduate student and the author of an M.A.  thesis (1957) on Ezra Pound's religion. Her study of "The Tensile  Light" remains a useful introduction to a most complicated subject.  Two other matters treated in much of this correspondence are  especially disturbing and cannot go unmentioned: Fascism and anti-  Semitism, which Pound espoused with varying intensity from the  1930's on. Although Pound was charged with treason for his wartime  broadcasts over Rome Radio, he was never tried, and therefore his  treason has never been legally proved. In these letters Pound acknowledges his attraction to Fascism but denies that the Fascist cause and  ideology have been properly understood in America; this is the  "misunderstanding" alluded to earlier. Far from following a policy of  aggression against the Western democracies, the Fascist nations had  allied only to defend themselves against usurocracy, the "enemy of all  mankind." "The axis was made in London," Pound tells Emery,  "the filth of the British punks [financiers] not an Italian choice of Germany." It turns out, then, that Fascism in its essence continues a  millenial war against usury, the same evil as Brooks Adams had diagnosed in 1897 in The Law of Civilization and Decay, and Adams "can  hardly have been writing Axis propaganda." Not only does Pound  deny his treason in the broadcasts, he asserts that the real treason lay  "in the White House," in short Roosevelt, who was no more than a  pawn in the hands of financiers while paradoxically leading America  toward "socialist rubbish." Roosevelt thus cuts a far less impressive  figure in Pound's eyes than does Benito Mussolini, who initiated the  career of Fascism with a "decent [political] minority" and with the  best of intentions, namely the state control of banking and the implementation of a corporate state: "You people in this country," says  Pound to Emery, "are so buggared by years of propaganda smear that  Mussolini looks ten times his size." Unfortunately, says Pound,  Mussolini's programme became corrupted when "sob's" entered his  government. These statements consort with others in which Pound  claims that Mussolini never got the chance to carry out his political  ideals: Canto 74, the first of the Pisan Cantos, opens with an elegiac  passage on the murdered Duce, the victim of Italian partisans and  ultimately of usurers. As for the prospect of a corporate state in  32 	asu06600000330034001							67297848 Bytes	3928	5709	1647491182	RGB	8	600	asu06600000330034001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1492	1492	1493.jp2	/asu0660/image/1493.jp2
Letters of Ezra Pound to Clark Emery in the University of Miami Library					Casillo, Robert																											asu0660000033	America, Pound's apologists have asserted that Pound, as in his 1935  volume Jefferson and/or Mussolini, never recommended Fascism for  export. This view is difficult to hold in view of Pound's radio broadcasts, where he favors a "corporate solution" for America, and also  the following remark in a letter of Pound's to Emery. After expressing  his admiration for Calvin Coolidge (in modern American politics  Pound favors the Republicans), Pound remarks that "BOTH Teddy  [Roosevelt] and Cal/C. moved toward real fascism, i.e. serious attempts to solve problems of labor organization." It may be that  Pound alludes to an act which helped Coolidge become President,  namely his putting down of the Boston Police Strike. In any case, by  "real fascism" Pound means the Fascist corporate state, in which  strikes are forbidden, labor is organized into state-regulated guilds,  and political representation is established on the basis not of citizenship or geography but of profession. Pound advocates the last two  reforms for America as late as 1960.  It is no less disturbing to discover the pervasiveness and virulence  of Pound's anti-Semitism, which persists from his radio broadcasts  and earlier. Like his apologists, who argue blindly that Pound confined his hatred to Jewish financiers, Pound offers mitigating  arguments, for instance that he dedicated Guide to Kulchur to the  poet Louis Zukofsky, his friend and a Jew. But Wagner too had Jews  in his entourage, and yet that did not make him any less an anti-  Semite. Nor does it count for much that Pound denies having "advo-  catefd] gas ovens"; even the most rabid anti-Semites generally deny  the murderousness of their aims. Pound's anti-Semitism rests in large  part on the rigid and historical distinctions put forth in Thaddeus  Zielinski's La Sibylle, a work which Emery and a student attempted to  translate at Pound's instigation, but which was finally published partially in another's translation in the Poundian magazine Edge.  Zielinski defines Greek and Roman paganism as the true religion  of love, Nature, aesthetic beauty, fecundity, and sexual harmony; only the pagan pantheon reconciles the masculine and feminine forms of  the divine. By contrast, the Near East represents (as in much Nazi  writing) either demonic matriarchy or demonic patriarchy, typified by  the cults of castrated Atys or brutal Jehovah; it stands for excess,  repression, anti-Nature. Zielinski further adds against a great weight  of historical evidence that true Christianity, by which this Mariolator  means Catholicism, stems from paganism, and that the Judaic influences on Christianity are a false and poisonous engraftment. Pound's  reliance on this dubious scheme is evident in his letters to Emery.  "Somewhere in the 20's or 30's," he remarks, Zielinski's Sibylle had  enabled him to "sort out" the "Hellenic" from the inauthentic  33 	asu06600000330035001							66712292 Bytes	3854	5768	1921609745	RGB	8	600	asu06600000330035001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1493	1493	1494.jp2	/asu0660/image/1494.jp2

Apart from his reference to the Near  Eastern Atys, whose "sterilization" distinguishes him from the  pagan Adonis, Pound mentions Thoreau's claim that "Hellenic  mythology" is superior to the "filth of Mesopotamia." He also  stipulates two culture centers, the "Mediterranean]" and the "Middle Kingdom" of China, separated implicitly by the Near Eastern  culture zone, a realm of darkness and confusion. While he  acknowledged the possibility that Greek religion has a foreign source,  Pound asserts that its origin must be in "[Aryan] India (as distinct  from the Middle East)." This remark conceals an Aryan ideology  which Pound was simultaneously encrypting in the later Cantos.  Fed by Zielinski and other anti-Semitic writers, Pound treats the  Old Testament as an intellectual chaos, a "collection of everything,"  with no thought to save the few "clean bits." Given the supposed  Semitic hatred of life and Nature, the Jews also play a major role in  modern monopoly and scarcity economics (usury). America has become "Baruchistan," run by the financiers of "New Pork." This  last phrase is almost certainly anti-Semitic in intent, for anti-Semites  are known to associate the Jews contemptuously with their tabooed  animal. Meantime, Pound's abhorrence of "psychoanalytic cat  piss," much in vogue in the 1950's, stems from his perception that it is  a Jewish science. In the 1930's Pound viciously satirizes the customs  of Jewish "Mitteleuropa," while in the later Cantos Freud is a chief  manifestation of the modern university, or "kikery." Like the Nazis,  Pound also entertains (as in his broadcasts) the astonishingly absurd  notion that Communism is no more than the tool and mask of Jewish  financiers: "For the spew deal punks/any man is anti-Sem who won't  sign on the dotted line for Marx and Rothschild simultaneously."  Finally, as evidence that Pound kept up with anti-Semitic literature  during his stay in the hospital, there is his reference to Mrs. Lesley  Fry's Waters Flowing Eastward. This anti-Semitic work comes from  the pen of one of the disseminators and popularizers of the infamous  Protocols of the Elders of Zion, to which Pound appeals in the radio  broadcasts as proof of a Jewish world conspiracy.  F. R. Leavis once spoke of the intellectual "degeneration," the increasing crudity and brutality of thought and feeling, which Pound  manifests in his letters. Pound's correspondence with Emery by no  means justifies this extremely harsh judgement. Admittedly these letters contain much that is wearying and repellent—a paranoid political  style, a dark ideology, a naive fascination with social and economic  nostrums, a tendency to egotistical rant. But Pound at his best can  never be numbered among those whom Burckhardt termed les ter-  ribles simplificateurs.

One is further struck by Pound's personal generosity  and nobility, his fortitude and humor in the most trying circumstances, and his persistent impulse to ignite new energies in art and  scholarship; no one in this century has done more to promote cultural  excellence. In sum, these letters convey the combined squalor and  splendor of the mind of Ezra Pound, one of the most extraordinary  men of modern times.  35 	asu06600000330037001							67657180 Bytes	3904	5775	396663633	RGB	8	600	asu06600000330037001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1495	1495	1496.jp2	/asu0660/image/1496.jp2

Bacon's Portraits of Our Time					Gilpin, George H.																											asu0660000034	THE  CARRELL  Volume 22 1984  Bacon's Portraits of Our Time  History . . . is the devil's scripture.  —Byron (1821)  by George H. Gilpin  4'The History of Europe in My Lifetime"1—that is the great theme  of paintings which since World War II have brought fame and controversy to the British artist Francis Bacon. Indeed, Bacon's paintings as  they confront the viewer with the "bestial floor," as W. B. Yeats  termed it, of our time, offer a Freudian understanding of the psychic  forces which have shaped that "History." Like Daumier's portraits of  post-Napoleonic France or Goya's Disasters of War or Picasso's  scenes of the Spanish Civil War, Bacon captures the horror of an age  of instincts unleashed. As he says, "So I could say, perhaps, I have  been accustomed to always living through forms of violence—which  may or may not have an effect upon one, but I think probably does."2  Born of British parents in Dublin in 1909, the self-taught artist left  revolutionary Ireland in 1925 to become an interior decorator in London. He first exhibited paintings there in 1930, but, after receiving little recognition, he virtually ceased painting in 1934. As a member of  the Civil Defense Corps during the War, Bacon witnessed first-hand  the destruction of London, and he began to paint again in a style  which when he exhibited three paintings in 1945 immediately brought  him attention and fame.3  While Bacon's success as an artist essentially began during the  War, because of his age he cites as influences artists from before the  war who examined the wasteland of modern civilization. Of T. S.  Eliot, he writes, "I always feel I've been influenced by Eliot. The  Waste Land especially and the poems before it have always affected  me very much. And I often read the Four Quartets, and I think perhaps they're even greater poetry than The Waste Land, though they  don't move me in the same way."4 And Bacon has found a reference  point in Conrad's Heart of Darkness, having "been possessed by the  1 	asu06600000340003001							66953896 Bytes	3895	5728	2479850114	RGB	8	600	asu06600000340003001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1502	1502	1503.jp2	/asu0660/image/1503.jp2
Bacon's Portraits of Our Time					Gilpin, George H.																											asu0660000034	1/  notion of Africa as a place where people do irremediable things to one  another and death stalks in the long dry spikes of the rustling grass."5  Bacon's "History," then, is of a primal world lacking in faith. His  use of religious iconography, as in those works called "Crucifixion"  and in his portraits of popes, becomes poignant in expressing suffering and terror. Much as Graham Sutherland was moved by the War to  paint terrifying cruciforms and briar-ridden landscapes instead of his  previous pastoral scenes, Bacon saw the destruction of London as a  crucifixion. His 1944 triptych, "Three Studies for Figures at the Base  of a Crucifixion," reveals the effect. Three misshapen, tortured, half-  bestial and half-human creatures convey his response to the suffering:  Bacon has referred to these forms as the "Eumenides," who in Greek  culture were thought to haunt and torture mankind,6 but the figures  could as well represent victims of the violence, who, like those who  witnessed the death of Christ, have lost all hope and are reduced to  nothing but downtrodden meekness, blind voraciousness, and howling despair. Salvation is out of the question in the face of such depravity. In the parallel triptych of 1962, "Three Studies for a Crucifixion," the figures begin in the first painting as human, then devolve  from the dressed to the naked; in the second painting, to the motif of  the naked couple writhing on a bed; then, in the third, to a still life of  a carcass. As John Rothenstein notices, "for Bacon, who is a non-  believer, the Crucifixion has no religious significance and is just an extreme and most celebrated instance of man's behavior to man" and  that for the artist carcasses of meat "have about them the smell of  death which he associates with the Crucifixion."7 Figure Study Two  (1945-46), another war time painting, is known also as "the Magdalene"8 and depicts a grieving, half naked, screaming feminine form  obviously caught by the violence, of an air-raid perhaps, and pathetically trying to shelter herself from the rain of fire with an umbrella  and a wool overcoat. She kneels over a table on which sit vases of  palms. Bacon's original title may refer to Mary Magdalene witnessing  the crucifixion without knowledge or hope of redemption. Certainly,  in the painting, innocence in the face of insane violence finds no  refuge, and the inclusion in the design of commonplace objects like  the umbrella and the overcoat give a poignant contemporary force to  the composition.  In the same way, Bacon's portraits of papal figures speak to the  matter of established faith confronted by the horror. The screaming  figure of the Pope in Bacon's imitation of Velaquez's "Pope Innocent  X" (1953) poignantly sets forth the paralysis of the Church in the face  of the times as we see the figure, still enthroned and garbed in regal  gown, yet apparently confined within bars and curtains. Indeed, in 	asu06600000340004001							66914280 Bytes	3855	5784	2654174924	RGB	8	600	asu06600000340004001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1503	1503	1504.jp2	/asu0660/image/1504.jp2
Bacon's Portraits of Our Time					Gilpin, George H.																											asu0660000034	some of Bacon's versions of screaming popes, the figures are encased  by a transparent cube which gives the impression of the scream being  silenced within the vacuum of a glass cell. The scenes could be of torture, or, even, of an execution. Bacon claims that the transparent  cubes, used often in his paintings, have no meaning other than to help  him "to see the image,"9 and certainly the geometrical shapes create  distance between the object and the viewer as does showing the paintings under glass, which Bacon prefers.10 The reference to Velasquez,  as well as the trappings of authority, contrast to the horror of the face  with its cavernous and vicious mouth and the impotence to act suggested by the composition as a whole. The paintings of popes are reminders of a lost world of authority and faith in which action was possible and from which is retained only instinctive recoil in its present insignificance. Hence, crucifixions and popes in Bacon's work become  mere relics in place of icons of faith. It is as if the symbols of Christianity had been transformed into a nearly faceless form distorted in  its utterance at the sight of "the horror."  In the absence of faith and in the face of violence, passion is left,  and yet, it, too, in the images of the paintings tends to reduce human  forms to carcasses and the ideals of love and ecstasy to lust and  bestiality. Sex exposes our mortality and it, like the presentation of  papal power, often occurs in a setting of restraint ultimately suggesting impotence. Lovers in their coupling are found to be encased on  their beds or confined in the transparent cubes, and they are often  watched over by indifferent, bored voyeurs who appear to be their  keepers or imprisoners.  The composition entitled "Triptych" (1967) is typical. There are  three large paintings, each 5 by 6 feet, and the first and third paintings  reveal the blurred forms of a copulating couple writhing on a platform  bed. Like a Muybridge study of human movement,11 the figures in the  first painting seem to be in motion in the fury of their coupling. Amid  the violence of their energy, only the teeth are distinct. There is a sense  of snakes writhing together, of bestiality, and it is not clear whether  the forms are different sexes or the same: they appear to be two  women with long hair. The third painting implies time has passed: the  lighting is darker and a cigarette pack apparent in the first image is  missing. However, a third figure who is dressed now observes the  writhing couple while talking on the telephone. This figure is reflected  in a mirror, a voyeur—suggestive of the viewer of the painting—who  casually contemplates the violent encounter. But, is the scene the same  as the first except for the lapse of time? The figures now appear to be  male rather than female with short rather than long hair.  Completing the triptych, which seems modeled more on Eastern 	asu06600000340005001							66849912 Bytes	3884	5735	1143993005	RGB	8	600	asu06600000340005001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1504	1504	1505.jp2	/asu0660/image/1505.jp2
Bacon's Portraits of Our Time					Gilpin, George H.																											asu0660000034	erotica than on Western religious expression, is the central scene, remote from the others and, upon immediate apprehension, more puzzling. In it another room is shown, perhaps in a hotel, with a towel  hung on the door knob and a suitcase in the foreground. As in the  other paintings, the center of attention is the bed, but in this instance,  amid the commonplace objects in the room, the viewer confronts the  raw meat of a still bloody carcass. This violent, terrible painting comments on the other two by linking in a surreal manner the butcher  shop with the violence of sheer, undifferentiated sexuality with its reminder of human mortality. As Bacon has said, "Well, of course, we  are meat, we are potential carcasses. If I go into a butcher's shop I always think it's surprising that I wasn't there instead of the animal."12  In "Triptych", the potential of the human beast is revealed in the  deadly sexual struggle. The composition is not of the life force of  D. H. Lawrence's lovers, but its contrary, the compulsion of mortality  and death. For Bacon, neither vitality nor regeneration comes from  sexuality; it is merely an instinct, a need of the beast fulfilled amid the  awful void of social being.  Man, then, in Bacon's view is isolated, alienated, ugly and insignificant. His paintings of single figures usually surround the human  form with a background of flat planes of color and dark lines of imprisoning hues. Even when posed at rest, apart from either violence or  sexuality, the human being shows a loss of dignity and nobility. Forms  are distorted, shriveled up, sometimes languishing in unflattering postures as in the case of Bacon's evocation of the traditional nude in two  life studies of Henrietta Moraes (1963, 1966). Her body is ugly, even  ridiculous, as she assumes the classical poses prescribed for the female  nude. The idyllic innocence of conventionality becomes distorted  amid the common terror.  If Bacon's artistic subject is not sexual or hinting of the sexual, it is  commonplace: shaving, talking, sitting passively, smoking a cigarette.  Sometimes, as in the full length self-portraits of 1972-73 or "Study for  a Portrait of Lucian Freud" (1971), the figures are alone in stiflingly  empty rooms. Or, as in "Study for Portrait of Seated Figure" (1977),  they seem incarcerated in chairs of excruciating design as if doomed to  execution in a gas chamber. These images convey Bacon's understanding of the human condition: "I think that man now realizes that he is  an accident, that he is a completely futile being, that he has to play out  the game without reason."13  People, then, are finally a scream. The screaming mouth, one of  Bacon's most pervasive motifs, is derived from several sources, including a close-up of the nurse just shot through the glasses and eye  from the film The Battleship Potemkin, and from a book on diseases  i 	asu06600000340006001							66320016 Bytes	3840	5755	3601341150	RGB	8	600	asu06600000340006001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1505	1505	1506.jp2	/asu0660/image/1506.jp2
Bacon's Portraits of Our Time					Gilpin, George H.																											asu0660000034	of the mouth.14 Even in his portraits of people, including friends, the  distortion centers around the gaping mouth. Bacon's portraits carry  on his understanding of postwar life. As the artist says, "Who can I  tear to pieces, if not my friends?"15 And there they are: Lucian Freud,  Isabel Rawsthorne, Henrietta Moraes, and the artist himself in his frequent self-portraits, stripped to their flesh, nearly carcasses, in the dissection of their mortality. Bacon's "heart of darkness," like  Conrad's, is ultimately the beast within us all, and no one is beyond  examination "like a patient etherized upon a table." As the critic  John Russell says of viewing the portraits: "We feel . . . that we have  penetrated to the inmost nature of human behaviour, and that these  people are betraying in the everyday traffic of life something of that  instinctual violence which marked the great warrior Cuchulain in the  height of battle."16  Whether in portraits or in groups or in multiple scenes, Bacon's  prisoners of history, often shown confined in real rooms or illusionary  chambers, have no true faces. The sense of distortion, usually to the  macabre, produces in the viewer a perception of a compound, superimposed state which the artist is attempting to unravel. This is the vitality of the aesthetic effort: a dissection of the human image to reveal  its awful essence. Bacon says "fact leaves its ghost,"17 and, indeed, we  find these shades in the paintings. What appears to be a vague, almost  obliterated, image becomes upon study a penetration to a deeper state  as Bacon explores the cavern of the modern psyche. Cancelled images  overlap newer ones with the effect of an X-ray until Bacon's unraveling reveals naked human mortality.18  And the understanding is deadly. Bacon's figures are ghosts because, for him, beyond the living lurks death. "I have a feeling," he  says, "of mortality all the time. Because, if life excites you, its opposite, like a shadow, death, must excite you."19 The portraits, then, are  of the opposites—the shadows or shades—of people who are encaged  by the history of the twentieth century. As John Rothenstein says of  Bacon and his work, "he does, however, believe in Hell—Hell is here  and now."20 Hence those who are dissected in portraits and life  studies as well as the deadly voyeurs who keep and restrain the living  in the more complex compositions are all inhabitants of the same  modern underworld. They image what the British psychiatrist, R. D.  Laing, has termed the "ontological insecurity" of the postwar era, a  condition defined in the renderings of other artists: "With Samuel  Beckett, for instance, one enters a world in which there is no contradictory sense of the self in its 'health and validity' to mitigate the despair, terror, and boredom of existence. ... In painting, Francis  Bacon, among others, seems to be dealing with similar issues."21 The 	asu06600000340007001							65985844 Bytes	3844	5720	2920685184	RGB	8	600	asu06600000340007001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1506	1506	1507.jp2	/asu0660/image/1507.jp2

Each painting is like Marlow's trip upriver in Heart of Darkness, a journey inward toward the primitive and the mortal. Finally,  the fact of every man portrayed is the fact of the violence and death of  our time. Neither authority nor philosophy can intervene, and the images of that condition can only be ghastly. As Rothenstein concludes,  "It is precisely because these apprehensions are presented to us in  terms so entirely appropriate to our own time that they continue to  haunt us so persistently. Bacon's contemporaries belonged to generations that have seen the destruction of cities by bombs, the flight of  whole peoples under the lash of fear, the concentration camps, the  death camps and the rest."22 Indeed, Bacon's vision is finally one of  history, and he shows us a real hell from which we may never escape.

The "Creature Poetry" of Stanley Burnshaw					Zaller, Robert																											asu0660000034	1L/  The "Creature Poetry" of Stanley Burnshaw  by Robert Zaller  The idea of creature poetry has been an essential element in  Stanley Burnshaw's practice both as poet and critic. Long before he  began to apply the term to himself and others, Burnshaw was writing  what he now calls "creature poems." Yet, despite his extended  meditation on the notion in The Seamless Web and, more recently, in  his lecture on "A Future for Poetry," he has refused to commit himself to any final or prescriptive definition. In part, his instinct as a  poet may be at work in this, for positive description is often recalcitrant to negative capability. But his judgment as a critic is suspensive  as well. That Burnshaw puts a pre-eminent value on creature poetry is  evident in the very act of his discussing it under a rubric such as "A  Future for Poetry;" that he chooses to leave the talk delivered under  that title in lecture form rather than tidy it into an essay illustrates his  continued unwillingness to harden his idea into a concept.  In this spirit, we may approach Burnshaw's own creature poems.  With or without a clear definition, there is no way to establish a  canonical list of these, and "creature" elements will obviously be  found in poems not so designated as a whole. Under the circumstances, the poet's own list commands priority, and I have confined  myself for present purposes largely to the one he has provided me. It  includes many of the poems from In the Terrified Radiance (1972), especially its title section, a number from Caged in an Animal's Mind  (1963), and a smattering from Early and Late Testament (1952) and  The Iron Land (1936).1  The former two titles themselves provide an entree into  Burnshaw's idea of creaturehood, and particularly our human relation to it. It is man, of course, who is caged in an animal's mind, a  rather horrific-seeming thought until we reflect that the "animal" is  man himself, and his cage therefore not an external restraint or confinement but distinctively his own product, his home-in-himself. What  Burnshaw will stress indeed is not man's estrangement from his fellow  creatures but his kinship with them. That kinship is paradoxically disclosed by the very advance of man's culture which, in order to remain  sane, must proceed dialectically, incorporating the more profoundly  that which it would transcend. Of this process, Burnshaw's metaphor  is itself the paradigm. The cage that man builds both structures his  world and constitutes his creaturely hearth in it, containing and reflecting the "terrified radiance" in which his mind exists.  What man discovers,  Burnshaw insists,  is what the creature  22 	asu06600000340023001							67221356 Bytes	3892	5755	3496219461	RGB	8	600	asu06600000340023001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1522	1522	1523.jp2	/asu0660/image/1523.jp2

His terror is refined, his "radiance"—that condition of  animal mind that is both grace and innocence and the focused cruelty  of hunger—refracted. The creature is his terror, his radiance; what he  experiences is huge but unbroken; what Burnshaw describes as a web  still encloses him, though his mind, still unborn to self-consciousness,  is far closer to ours than we know. Man alone has broken the "paradise-web" of creaturely existence in which he once had full share,  retracing his acts to the source he has learned to call "I." The result is  the loss of that pre-conscious state that Burnshaw calls "eden" and  finds nostalgically defined in every human culture.  Creature awareness—as opposed to creature consciousness, which,  as Burnshaw warns us in The Seamless Web, we can study but not participate in—begins with the sense of loss. In discursive terms, this is  experienced as the burden of self-consciousness, and the yearning  toward reunion with some imagined whole, be it natural or divine. In  poetic ones, it has been indelibly defined for our culture by the two resplendent metaphors of Genesis, nakedness and exile. And as Stanley  Burnshaw is pre-eminently a poet of the Testament, as not only the title of his second book of verse but his extraordinary meditation on the  sources of Jewish myth in his novel The Refusers suggests, these  metaphors have served him as well.  In a short poem, "The Finding Light" (TR 19), Burnshaw is startled into awareness when a small rock splits suddenly at a vein, and  sees nakedness unbearably revealed:  Openness always dying, without the shield of a skin—  More bruisable naked than else on earth is stone  The only consolation in this scene (but consolation for whom?) is  the "finding light" of compassion that it "wrings" from the human  observer. Burnshaw suggests that this compassion completes and perhaps in some sense anneals the scene. But he recognizes as well that the  vulnerability of nature to its own processes—what he calls with splendid precision "Openness always dying"—surrounds us constantly,  "ever unseen," and only at brief, rare intervals making an entering  wedge into our consciousness. We could hardly bear more; yet such  moments are essential to us in our own nakedness as well, for without  compassion (as Burnshaw suggests, though beyond the confines of  this poem), what would remain but self-pity?  Compassion, however, is only the beginning of a properly human  knowledge. In "The Finding Light," awareness of the stone is conditioned by the sense of all the agonies of natural process that go unnoticed, that can be grasped, indeed, only in isolate particulars. Thus, in  23 	asu06600000340024001							66353884 Bytes	3852	5740	3377287341	RGB	8	600	asu06600000340024001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1523	1523	1524.jp2	/asu0660/image/1524.jp2
The "Creature Poetry" of Stanley Burnshaw					Zaller, Robert																											asu0660000034	«./  "Gulls . . ." (TR 17), Burnshaw builds upon the stone image to suggest a continuous process:  Gulls  Drop their unreachable prey from the air  Till the shells  Crack on the dying stone open  "Dying stone open" resonates outward into the "Openness always  dying" of "The Finding Light": but here the stone, busy with its own  "dying," serves as the agent of another death. It is typical of Burnshaw's powers of compression that he is able to fuse all three terrestial  elements—sea, air, earth—into an image which unfolds in four brief  lines; but the universality of process he wishes to suggest is already implicit in the ellipsis of the poem's title, and the remainder of the poem  is in effect a gloss on those three dots.  With the gull (and, elsewhere, such predators as the crow), Burnshaw introduces the theme of animal intelligence. As matter complicates itself into life, and organic substance evolves into creature  mobility, the problem of subsistence becomes ever more complex. Intelligence responds to this, and what intelligence does, of necessity, is  to kill. What the gull does by means of the rock, the otter accomplishes more craftily, more consciously, as he  Sinks to the sea's floor to gather  A stone that will break the clam he holds  Close to his breast.  ("Not to Bereave . . . ," TR 22)  The implication is clear. Man, the most accomplished tool-user,  the most highly developed intelligence, is the most capable killer. Of  course, human culture has long outgrown this primitive function,  which once involved the whole social group but is now the specialized  task of only a few. This has produced an extraordinary result, so  extraordinary that it calls planetary history itself into question. Burnshaw ponders this in "Erstwhile Hunter" (TR 20), where "the killer  gale/Blown by the life from nowhere" which purged blindly in the  dawn of organic life evolves the ultimate predator, man, who now,  "erstwhile hunter," has "Become a nurse to flowers." Man himself,  the ^//-conscious creature, is now left to consider the ironic twist in  natural process which he represents. Is the nurturant will "To make  the dying live" merely "The one wild gift that men/Could add to the  world's landscape" ("Innocent War," TR 16), or does it signify some  24 	asu06600000340025001							67718644 Bytes	3934	5736	1884097471	RGB	8	600	asu06600000340025001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1524	1524	1525.jp2	/asu0660/image/1525.jp2
The "Creature Poetry" of Stanley Burnshaw					Zaller, Robert																											asu0660000034	as yet undisclosed evolutionary direction, some purpose not revealed  until now?  But man's racing mind asks too much, Burnshaw thinks: it asks  gods. In the childhood of the race, men learned to divorce matter  from spirit, and to demand from the latter what the former could not  provide, a resolution of the human condition, nirvana or apocalypse.  Time has disappointed them. It is not to be reckoned in centuries or  millenia, as they have learned only within the past two hundred years,  but in eons barely conceivable. We are in this world, and must live in it  without hope of another.  To accept this condition is now man's task, and, Burnshaw suggests, it may be the hardest he has faced.  Man with brow in the air  Man with the spine erect,  Forepaws hung at the sides,  Drop your head to the grass:  What can you hear down there?  Nothing, nothing, nothing!  Listen, listen, listen,  Man with head in the air:  Raise it higher and higher  To the plain of alarming birds:  What can you hear up there?  Nothing, nothing, nothing!  ("The Valley Between," TR 88-9)  The imperative voice, compact rhythms and hectoring tone all  heighten the sense of a forced and relentless march. Yet there is no  path to follow, nor even a ground. "Unlinked to below or above,"  man flails on, impelled only by his own terror: "Leap left, leap right,  for the course."  This, for Burnshaw, is the image of modern man. But it is also the  image of his remotest ancestor, stumbling blindly in the meshes of his  own fear. At the very moment of planetary dominion, when the  dreams of eden have at last been realized, the circle of terror is closed,  and man is as helpless as in his beginning.  In this helplessness, men herd together in great cities. But "Black  is cold/In a city of night or a cave" ("A Recurring Vision," TR 96-7),  and the void kept out, by ancestral hearth or modern technopolis, is  25 	asu06600000340026001							66326476 Bytes	3859	5727	1303029526	RGB	8	600	asu06600000340026001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1525	1525	1526.jp2	/asu0660/image/1526.jp2
The "Creature Poetry" of Stanley Burnshaw					Zaller, Robert																											asu0660000034	ii:  only the more securely locked in. In a later poem, "In the Coastal  Cities" (TR 46-7), the vision of despair is yet more extreme, as daylight "breaks in black," and the inhabitants wait on nothing as  "Helplessness/Foams in their eyes, tightens their hands."  Passivity, however, is not man's only recourse. What he can  neither accept nor amend, he can now destroy. In a poem whose  bleakness is relieved only by the irony of its title, "Chanson Inno-  cente" (TR 48), Burnshaw contemplates the imminent exhaustion of  "the mother-once sea, the nurturing sky,/The hostage acres" by "our  all-devouring hordes." It is not only the proliferation of man's  numbers which endangers the earth, however, but a lust for  apocalypse which, no longer satisfied by faith, turns inward upon  itself with "strangelove mind and suicide hand." This bitter image,  which ends the poem, seems to sum up in its apposition of  mind/hand, of berserker intellect and despairing will, the perverse  evolution of a species gone mad. Burnshaw "hail[s]/Catastrophe,"  seeing no remnant of sanity in the race but its original endowment of  animal fear, the "terrified creature-lust/To survive."  Burnshaw is as close to actual misanthropy here as he will get, and  his refusal to exempt himself from the indictment makes it the more  chillingly complete: even the poet-seer, warning the tribe, lends a hand  to destruction. But, however grim his vision, Burnshaw does not yield  to despair. That men can destroy themselves does not mean that they  must, and the poet's task, in his view, is neither to simply describe nor  decry the nihilism around him, but to examine and, as far as possible,  to exemplify the ways in which man can cope with his present crisis  and adapt to this, his second and final eden.  For Burnshaw, this means a return to literal origins. Bereft of his  gods, desolate in his intelligence, man has only one sure resource to  fall back on: his heritage as a creature. This will entail, however, a  radical reversal of perspective. Man has always looked to the future,  in fear because it contains his creaturely death, in hope because it offers—at least to hope—his only possible transcendence. But now, if he  is to have any future at all, he must learn to think historically, even  geologically, not of what he might wish to be but of what he has been  and still is. Disconnected from his present self, "Unlinked to below or  above," he must regain contact with his animal selfhood, the only true  genealogy he has. This does not of course imply any sort of cultural or  evolutionary retrogression, such as is now fashionable in survivalist  literature. Still less is it a license for hedonism. It means an imaginative rewitnessing of our human past for the sake of a renewed integration with our earthly present.  Thus, Burnshaw strives to bring back the erstwhile hunters, the  26  r 	asu06600000340027001							67354784 Bytes	3904	5749	1515184126	RGB	8	600	asu06600000340027001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1526	1526	1527.jp2	/asu0660/image/1527.jp2
The "Creature Poetry" of Stanley Burnshaw					Zaller, Robert																											asu0660000034	"father faces" and "ancient women" whose axes were abandoned  "By the sleeping caves of the world," the "violent ones" for whom  the earth was still "early and huge," and whose voices still "speak/In  underbreathing song" in the veins of the living (TR 21, 20, 29, 83, 24).  These revenants cannot be summoned by "wilful dreaming," but  come upon the poet in trance-like moments of attention when, "dazed  in a field," their voices seem to rock the trees. Burnshaw's image  strikingly recalls the ruah or spirit-wind of the Old Testament. But,  unlike the wind that bears the divine message, these sourceless murmurs remain indecipherable. They leave only stillness and silence  behind, a "Shaken emptiness." Without omen or proof, the poet  knows nonetheless that he has been profoundly spoken to, and imagines how the voices might yet return to pull him "Into the redness of  their singing river" ("Their Singing River," TR 21).  The implication of this last line, that the voices arise within the  poet's own blood, is developed in "Underbreathing Song" (TR 24).  Here, beyond the most delicate sense or perception, voices that  "neither wake/Nor sleep" in the deepest recesses of one's flesh "live  you and re-live," as if the existence of the living were only an extension of the dream of the immortal dead. One's individual life, Burnshaw suggests, must be seen, and at certain moments perhaps even experienced, as the temporal embodiment of the whole human past, a  co-existence of all our ancestral selves.  Burnshaw's subtlest realization of this theme is in "A River" (TR  108-9), where he imagines himself lost in a vaguely remembered landscape. He seems to see a river, which dissolves however into a vacant,  unreflecting plain of light, as if it were "too old" to "carry blue to  blue." He remembers then having followed "an unknown hurrying  man" whose "fleshless form" left no shadow, and prays that he may  be warned against his own "hour/of flight"  Before my body can gaze with empty eyes  And love become too inward borne to answer  Light of a sun with light.  Like the Greeks, Burnshaw imagines death as a physical ground  with which the self is gradually merged; but it is the primordial ground  as well, which opens through shifting perspectives into the geological  past. The hurrying shade which presages his own death is also,  perhaps, an ancestral double, but his flight is only a winnowing away  of earthly form, for (as in "Their Singing River"), the stilled trees are  alive with the "presences" to whom the poet offers his prayer for final  consciousness before "love" must turn "inward."  27 	asu06600000340028001							66565692 Bytes	3867	5736	836698327	RGB	8	600	asu06600000340028001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1527	1527	1528.jp2	/asu0660/image/1528.jp2
The "Creature Poetry" of Stanley Burnshaw					Zaller, Robert																											asu0660000034	Apology must be offered for so hasty a summary of so complex  and evocative a poem. While affirming the consciousness of self (the  force that may, however briefly, love outward) as the necessary  burden of our humanity, Burnshaw acknowledges the "presences"  that surround, accompany and (in "Underbreathing Song") inhabit  the self. Each individual existence, he suggests, validates all previous  ones, as it in turn will be validated by future lives. It is a process  which as far transcends individual consciousness as it does the individual life span; but mind holds the balance, mind is the key. It is  just in this that the human paradox most forcibly appears, however:  that the mind-self through which the temporal succession of being is  reconciled must itself be reconciled to a process which entails what it  necessarily perceives as its own extinction.  The function of consciousness is to crystallize being, to bring "the  world to focus in a feeling brain" in the words of a poet Burnshaw importantly resembles, Robinson Jeffers.2 But, alone among all  creatures, man cannot merely execute his function. He must design  what he does: must make his function a task. This is what Burnshaw  calls the "axe of Eden," the cleft in animal consciousness that  separates man from the rest of creation. That cleft is an edge, and the  edge hones a blade: the first of all tools, the sharpened stone that man  carries out of paradise. The gull and the otter crush the clam, but  man's paradigm instrument cuts both ways; "The edge that kills  creates." Though mind may reconcile being, even as it struggles to accept and understand what it does, that acceptance is dynamic, not a  terminus but an adventure. "Enter your tremulous wholeness," Burnshaw counsels:  The world is one and the world is a trillion fragments  Of touch. Grow them together, cleave them apart—  They bear no scar.  ("The Axe of Eden," TR 98-104)3  The wound of knowledge is man's; the world is whole. But neither  suffices any longer without the other; each is a destiny for the other.  In Burnshaw's view, man must pursue this difficult dialectic without  losing heart. He has arrived at the crucial moment where he must  abandon his gods and forge his own path, and his present situation is  not attractive. In a poem entitled "Petitioner Dogs" (TR 91), Burnshaw imagines man's proverbial (and only) friend aspiring to his  master's consciousness, so that he too may "slobber ... in despair."  Facing at last his unique isolation in all its implication, man may  "Languish under [his] axe," or wield it in a frenzy of destruction. But  28 	asu06600000340029001							67120588 Bytes	3904	5729	817434775	RGB	8	600	asu06600000340029001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1528	1528	1529.jp2	/asu0660/image/1529.jp2
The "Creature Poetry" of Stanley Burnshaw					Zaller, Robert																											asu0660000034	i/  there is hope yet that he may attain to what Burnshaw calls planetary  maturity, and accept a creative stewardship over what he now irresponsibly controls. Science in its best sense, as disinterested inquiry,  can contribute to the growth of this new constructive consciousness,  and so can the kind of versifying that Burnshaw calls creature poetry.  Like the consciousness it hopes to advance, it redefines itself in the act  of each fresh creation. Burnshaw finds it in the work of such poets as  Robert Frost and James Dickey, but also in the poem of a Ugandan  schoolgirl about her own buttocks. But it is nowhere better realized  than in one of Burnshaw's earliest poems, "Bread," which is  simultaneously a meditation on the unity of creation and a splendid  love poem, a stoicism that sings. As Burnshaw has given it in full in  "A Future for Poetry," I will quote only its last stanzas:  . . . whatever the bread, do not grieve now  That soon a flash of the wind  May hurry away what remains  Of this quiet valiance of grass:  It entered your body, it fed you  So that you too can pass  From valiance to quiet, from thriving  To silenced flesh, and to ground:  Such is our meager cycle  That turns but a single round  For the deathless flesh of the earth,  For the signless husks of men dead,  For the folded oceans and mountains,  For birds, and fields, and for bread.  29 	asu06600000340030001							67234152 Bytes	3891	5758	1800163944	RGB	8	600	asu06600000340030001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1529	1529	1530.jp2	/asu0660/image/1530.jp2
The "Creature Poetry" of Stanley Burnshaw					Zaller, Robert																											asu0660000034	Notes  1. Letter from Stanley Burnshaw to the author, November 26, 1983. Mr.  Burnshaw's list is culled entirely from his In the Terrified Radiance (New York: George  Braziller, 1972), which includes the new book of that title together with selections from  his three earlier volumes (henceforth 77?). The poems cited are, by page number: 77? 15,  16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 27, 28, 46, 48, 83, 85, 86, 87, 88, 96, 108, 163, 173,  193, 202, 203.  2. The Selected Poetry of Robinson Jeffers (New York: Random House, 1959), p.  365. In his Preface to The Double Axe and Other Poems (New York: Liveright, 1977),  Jeffers comments: "It seems time that our race began to think as an adult does, rather  than like an egocentric baby or insane person." Cf. the remarks about planetary maturity, below, p. 12. Jeffers' own use of axe symbolism is another significant affinity.  3. Though not listed by Burnshaw, "The Axe of Eden" seems to me crucial to an  elucidation of creature poetry. Since 1972, he has published a new verse volume,  Mirages: Travel Notes in the Promised Land (New York: Doubleday, 1977), whose final  section in particular is an important extension of the idea.  30 	asu06600000340031001							67753740 Bytes	3915	5767	561593793	RGB	8	600	asu06600000340031001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1530	1530	1531.jp2	/asu0660/image/1531.jp2

Essays on a Man					Emery, Clark Mixon, 1909-																											asu0660000038	Clark Emery  Essays on a Man  On the occasion of T. S. Eliot's death, I was asked to write and  to deliver (in the Episcopal chapel on the University of Miami campus)  a eulogy.  Which I did—as follows:  Eliot  If any single line of English poetry sums up the life-long teaching  of T. S. Eliot, it is that ambiguous exclamation of John Donne, later  to become the most eminent of Anglican divines: "For God's sake,  hold your tongue and let me love." From his earliest dramatic monologue to his latest verse-drama, Eliot explored love both in its physical  and in its spiritual aspects—more often, perhaps, in its failures than  in its triumphs, but certainly not neglecting the latter.  Love has been defined as "the adhesion of the will to an object which  is presented by the intellect as good." It is an austere, even forbidding  definition, but it is one which the poet who prays God to "Teach us  to care and not to care, Teach us to sit still" would affirm. For clear  vision, steady intellection, the ability to discriminate between the difficult best and the easy good-enough, a passionate caring for the former  and an active willing toward its attainment—these are the qualities  revealed in all of Eliot's work.  The love that he esteems is sharply distinguished from the sentimental swoon or spasm induced by moonlight and roses or Sousa marches,  from the physical itch that metamorphoses two human beings into a  single two-backed beast, and from the effete yearning which, like jasmine tea, turns from tepid to cold "among velleities and carefully caught  regrets." In such cases, the neural or physiological subjugates the intellectual, permitting it no power of choice; or, if the intellect somehow  contrives to make a choice, it receives from the will no assistance toward  the chosen object.  Thus we have at one extreme Apeneck Sweeney—"Gesture of orangoutang, rising from the sheets in steam"; and Grishkin, whose "friendly 	asu06600000380007001							66628892 Bytes	3868	5740	2667118329	RGB	8	600	asu06600000380007001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1541	1541	1542.jp2	/asu0660/image/1542.jp2

And between the extremes are so many of the rest of us, crowds  of people walking around in a ring, the unfortunates who never were  alive, neither rebellious nor faithful, but only for themselves, the spiritually slothful, so busily engaged in devising the perfect refrigerator,  in working out a rational morality, in printing as many books as possible; who, confronted by the fact that all flesh is grass, believe that "The  first thing to do is to form the committees: the consultative councils,  the standing committees, select committees, and sub-committees"; and  the monument of whose civilization will be "the asphalt road and a  thousand lost golf-balls."  Almost all that I have to this point quoted or paraphrased from  Mr. Eliot comes from his pre-Anglican poems—which so consummately caught and expressed the mood of the intellectuals of the 1920's that  he was adopted as their voice crying in their wilderness. But he was  not their voice; it was, for Eliot, precisely they who were the generation of vipers who needed to be scotched. And so he made a public  declaration of his allegiance to his new testament: classicism, royalism,  and Catholicism. It produced a shock felt round the world. That a man  so intelligent, and well-educated, and ironically perceptive—in a word,  so modern—should renounce the Unitarian enlightenment and submerge himself in the medieval mummery of Catholicism, even though  it was only Anglo-Catholicism—a faith that interferes neither with a  man's morality nor his religion—was incredible to the Liberal Humanists who had claimed him as their own.  But the move was logical. What the Liberals had not understood  was that The Waste Land and its companion poems were not merely  an exposure of the time, but equally a mea culpa, a confession of a  failure in love as a direct result of spiritual sloth. Unlike his fellow-liberals, he did not blame those convenient Others—politicans, military  leaders, and the like—but himself and his ilk, and he proceeded from  confession to contrition to adequate recompense in the form of Ash  Wednesday, The Rock, the verse-drama, and Four Quartets. For those  liberals too impercipient to grasp the meaning of the poems, he put  the matter in plain prose in his book The Idea of a Christian Society,  where he says of Liberal Humanism:  / 	asu06600000380008001							66637092 Bytes	3884	5717	3616675063	RGB	8	600	asu06600000380008001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1542	1542	1543.jp2	/asu0660/image/1543.jp2
Essays on a Man					Emery, Clark Mixon, 1909-																											asu0660000038	By destroying traditional social habits of the people, by dissolving their natural collective consciousness into individual constituents, by licensing the opinions of the most foolish, by substituting instruction for education, by encouraging cleverness  rather than wisdom, the upstart rather than the qualified, by  fostering a notion of getting on to which the alternative is a  hopeless apathy, Liberalism can prepare the way for that which  is its own negation: the artificial, mechanized or brutalized control which is a desperate remedy for its own chaos.  Because of Mr. Eliot, neither Liberal Humanism nor Anglo-Catholicism has since been or henceforth can be what it was. He has augmented  our vocabulary, refined our sense of rhythm, re-organized our sensibility, sharpened our vision, and persuaded us to a revaluation of our values. He has compelled the Christian to intellectualize his affirmations  and the skeptic to discriminate his denials. He has forced answers to  his questions:  Where is the Life we have lost in living?  Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge?  Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?  "The good man," Mr. Eliot said, "is the builder, if he build what  is good." He was by his own definition, a good man, who has won  home, after the difficult passage through the waste land, to  Shantih       shantih       shantih  A good many years later, retired, with time on my hands, having  read the greater part of Dryden's, Pope's, Byron's, and Browning's  poems, I was moved to turn the eulogy into a verse-essay, in the manner of Pope but, modified by Browning, not so heroically coupleted.

(Acts 2:2)  I have sat in the dumb house  waiting for a song to sound  me out and make me sound, full  as a storm trooping heaven,  still as the eye of the wind,  draft of the dove's upward rush.  Some static, ecstatic rush,  still unmoving in the house,  might move me still, or a wind  sweep my tongue with a dry sound  up the chimney, or heaven  drizzle. Can I not be filled  again: riven, spent, be filled  again, rocked among rushes,  a tower hewn toward heaven,  a loaf lifting through the house  its fine aroma, filled, sound  as the wheat, the wave, the wind,  even the song of the wind,  wayward, prophetic, fulfilled?

There appeared unto them  cloven tongues  like as of fire.  (Acts 2:3)  They share a dream of fire,  one of blood, while they wait there  in an attic that swells like  an egg in heat. It appears  they are the burden, ripe tongues,  mute, swollen, rooted, cloven  as a serpent. The cloven  head and heel of sweet fire  promises the bursting tongues  of phoenix. They are tight there  as an egg, airs apparent  of a silence that is like  a curved shell and space that like  a knob waits to be cloven,  to be turned: features appear  then, facets of the fire,  the possible faces, there,  of every fortune, the tongues  that speak the future, the tongues  that lift time off its pad like  a rocket: time and space: there,  then: now, here: nowhere: cloven  rock of ages, muse of fire.

Only in their dreams, on tongues  of pearl, he climbs cold fire  to the sun and darkens like  Judas asunder, cloven  earth, erupted, sodden, there.  Judas: a world's litter. There  they are, like apparitions  that fade upon a cloven  air or a host on the tongue,  awaiting new bodies, like  doves, like the wind, like fire.  They were all filled  and began to speak  as the spirit gave them utterance.  (Acts 2:4)  Time has no handles, gods give  whatever: we are not filled.  O stomach, stomach—spirit—  Saucers fill the sky. Begin  again; spill, like milk, and speak.  Perhaps the neighbor's cat speaks,  grimly, "We're all mad here." Give  me room, a clear beginning.  Days: I keep busy, filling  the yard with flowers. Spirit  drifts with blown petals, spirit  lifts on the basil or speaks  through silent toads, beautiful  bonds of brown sunshine. I give  my days the garden, begin  \ with waiting, do not begin.  , I've learned my will's not spirit.  J I doubt I know my will. Give  us, forgive us—Prayer speaks  willful and unfulfilling.  15 	asu06600000380017001							66535464 Bytes	3868	5732	3727784247	RGB	8	600	asu06600000380017001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1551	1551	1552.jp2	/asu0660/image/1552.jp2

(Acts 2:8)  What word struggles to be born  above the marketplace? How  many angels pin their tongues  to the wall and who will hear  fido wag and echo: man?  They are waiting for the man  to walk across the sky, born  on the clouds, waiting to hear  the summons, willing, somehow,  to drown in that fine air, tongues  flowing like bright banners, tongues  of flame, roasted flesh. God, man,  the smell of burnt meat! And how  else may the past reach us born  from old graves? They wait to hear  the word and perhaps they hear  us, hoarding atoms, our tongues  flagging Babel. They have born  their grief in silence. Each man  now, at the nonce, rises. How  they leap! How they stagger! How  they sing! At last the crowd hears,  in the word of every man,  doomsday glitter, on their tongues'  milk and briny spittle, born.  16 	asu06600000380018001							65915388 Bytes	3865	5683	1939621011	RGB	8	600	asu06600000380018001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1552	1552	1553.jp2	/asu0660/image/1553.jp2

Snakeskins, awful  reminders, lace another  spring, one root or another,  lilac, forsythia, mock  orange. Such routine, so full  of repetition and new  plots, charms, stupifies, like wine.

Or fix, at least, your name  firmly in some official firmament.  But what good is a gift  (however permanent)  I could hardly select:  a stranger sealing your name  in a giant registry, and choosing  a star someone else's name  might already belong to—  as if more of us existed  than bodies in the night sky.  And the star might even be dead—  red giant, white dwarf, or flame  of supernova—I'd have  no control over what exactly  I might be saying. And though you persist,  with some romantic view  of the light reaching us  (however faintly)  long after the fire had swallowed  itself, although you insist  on one star in lieu  of all the stars I would give you—  it would be for me, finally,  a redundancy, however desirable:  something celestial I can barely see,  with your name on it.  22 	asu06600000380024001							66465332 Bytes	3880	5708	3106060664	RGB	8	600	asu06600000380024001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1558	1558	1559.jp2	/asu0660/image/1559.jp2
Waiting for the Comet					Schmitt, Peter, 1958-																											asu0660000038	Waiting for the Comet  My friends are leaving for the Keys  to see the comet. For them it will be  a milestone, a line of demarcation  to remember like a first date,  a first morning together.  But I don't want to squint to see it,  nor travel miles from my quiet apartment  in the city, to stand on a dark shore  beneath a moonless sky,  binoculars in hand to bring it in,  and regret the competing starlight.  Or to climb above the pinkish glow  of millions of lightbulbs,  to wait my turn  with the other gawkers  for the telescope at the observatory,  to bend and see it vaguely  pulsing in place like something caught  on a slide in 7th grade Science.  Mo, I'd like to step from my door  and see it as some time-lost ancestor  must have—as a sight  to invent a god for,  to gather one's kin around  and watch it move the measure  of an upraised arm,  a lengthening rent  closing itself each night.  I want to feel his hesitance  before that riverbed of dust and astral dirt,  a trail I could almost walk  back through time. To know  that some amazements never change,  like the sudden apprehension  of a love that comes, they say,  once in a lifetime if you're lucky,  in the right place, your eyes open.  23 	asu06600000380025001							66758388 Bytes	3872	5745	674686125	RGB	8	600	asu06600000380025001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1559	1559	1560.jp2	/asu0660/image/1560.jp2

The sky is flat and scudding clouds drift south  To blind a small and sunken sun, pale eye  Of life that summons them to other forms.  What knowledge after pain of loss, what love  When thought creates warm images of scenes  Forever lost in the blackened throat of time.  Fat swallows flit where vacant windows stare,  And I a dead soul wander with the dead.  Adam and Eve  He was watching her  Not as a thing apart  But blissful as a child  With his own arm or leg.  Between them there was what  Could not have come at once.  A bud their sun of love  Had brought from seed and shoot.  They lived its flowering.  Berry on the bush.  Come, eat with me,  Sun so bright above.  Eye met eye and saw  Not earth as thing apart  But as the upthrusting tree  Their branches grew upon.  24 	asu06600000380026001							66400800 Bytes	3888	5691	2807853749	RGB	8	600	asu06600000380026001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1560	1560	1561.jp2	/asu0660/image/1561.jp2

Beautiful, and brittle as stiff flowers  that crumble at the touch.  One thinks with the mind of one's time,  one uses the words it allows  in the ways it allows,  and not otherwise. One writes  the poetry it permits. Another age,  finding such words, skillfully arrayed,  will make a poet famous for what he never said,  will make our Homer, and make him blind.  What is it that Anselm's proofs  no longer prove? We have no word.  Creation Theory  Light explodes from a stone fist  and so every rock  is the cavern of a thousand suns,  is paradise encapsuled.  But whose, you say,  the hand that closed that fist?  It is no matter.  Five-pointed like a star  it lies open, generous  and its fingers stream infinity  back into stone.  27 	asu06600000380029001							67595204 Bytes	3895	5783	2089877843	RGB	8	600	asu06600000380029001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1563	1563	1564.jp2	/asu0660/image/1564.jp2

Introduction					Brown, William E., Jr.																											asu0660000043	NMODIKTION  THE CITY OF MIAMI boasts many attractions and wonders,  both natural and man-made, and residents have never been  hesitant to sing the praises of their native or adopted home.  From Miami's very beginnings, its citizens recognized the importance of attracting new resi  dents; commercial and agricultural interests; local, regional, and international businesses;  and, of course, tourists. Never bashful about noting the many advantages of life in the subtropical  paradise of South Florida, Miami residents may  occasionally be guilty of slight exaggerations in  their fervor to promote the beauty and pleasures  of life here in "The Magic City."  Promotional literature offers an important and  colorful avenue to explore the historical development of Miami and its environs.  In the early 1900s, promotional literature often championed the healthful and cathartic value of the Miami climate. As the  city grew and related service industries prospered, Miamians sought to  lure an expanded clientele. The boom period of the post World War I  era and the boosterism of the early 1920s provided a unique opportunity for enthusiastic writers to sing the praises of life in Miami. The era  of the 1920s produced a number of eye-catching flyers and  brochures, captivating pamphlets and bulletins, finely  printed keepsakes and tributes, and a wide variety of  commercial and government publications designed  to document and promote the geographic growth,  fiscal development, population expansion, commercial and agricultural advancement, and cultural evolution of greater Miami. In addition,  these booklets and circulars offer a wealth of  financial,   business,   and   social   information.  Ironically, these documents are often as interesting  for what they do not say as for the information they  do contain. Promotional materials for later decades  reflect the evolution of communication in a diverse media  society, as the advent of radio and television advertising offered  competition for the printed word and image.

Introduction					Brown, William E., Jr.																											asu0660000043	The   onset   of  the   Great  Depression required a slight  alteration in the message and  the  intended  audience,   but  the continual promotion of the  greater Miami region did not  abate.   Similarly,   the  onset  of  World War II required a redefinition of Miami's many pleasures, but  the rapid economic expansion of the  1950s  generated a renewed  appetite for information on Miami's  increasing residential and  commercial opportunities. The social  and political unrest of the  1960s  and 1970s affected Miami, as it  did so many other urban centers, and the promotional literature  of the day addressed changing racial, ethnic, and cultural attitudes.  Contemporary promotional materials bridge the time span of one hundred years and present the Miami of the next century. Modern publications reflect the traditional historical factors that first led individuals to  settle in this backwater community of the late 1890's, as they also portray a modern international metropolitan region positioned to excel in  the twenty-first century. How will we view these documents in one hundred years? Perhaps with the same sense of curiosity, nostalgia, sympa-  1  ■'■-■■h:  thy, and inquisitiveness that spurs us to examine the materials presented  in this exhibition.  The Archives and Special Collections Department of the Otto G.  Richter Library is pleased to join the celebration of the City of Miami's  Centennial. The Florida Collection contains a wealth of scholarly  resources, including original letters, diaries, and writings; photographs,  maps, and other visual materials; sound  recordings  and  oral  histories;   and l4^^  such traditional materials as books,  newspapers, and journals.  The promotional literature  highlighted in this publication  appeared in an exhibition at  the Otto G. Richter Library  from April 15, 1996 - August  15, 1996.

One  physician offered the comment that, "The life extension of the  individual will perceptibly increase in relative proportion to the  time lived in this region." With regard to the elderly, a doctor  noted that, "the natural strength of resistance is augmented by  the natural therapeutic benefits of the climate and the breaking  point may be postponed until a much later period in life."

Miami, Fla.: Chamber of Commerce, 1939.  This ambitious publication attempted to ask and answer the  many questions potential tourists and visitors had about  Miami. In response to the question "Are there quiet amusements and diversions — opportunities for relaxation and rest?"  The answer was, "Yes, there are extensive layouts for shuffle-  board, croquet, checkers, and similar games; and there are  many quiet, residential sections of the city entirely free from  noise and crowds." Needless to say, all questions had positive  answers designed to ameliorate any fears or concerns among  those unfamiliar with life in Miami.  m£  *m  17 	asu06600000430019001							77182440 Bytes	5907	4354	599912539	RGB	8	600	asu06600000430019001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1586	1586	1587.jp2	/asu0660/image/1587.jp2

In a combination of color and black and white illustrations,  this 1947 promotional brochure depicts Miami in its emerging post-World War II glory. The collage of color images on  the cover sends a clear and inviting message to residents of  northern cities and towns. As the "Playground of the World  and one of the most delightful cities in the world in which to  live permanently," Miami hosted more than 300,000 residents, 75,000 homes, 101 flourishing industries, and "a couple of million visitors every year."  23  24  2C  The Miami-Battle Creek, Miami Springs (Miami), Florida.

Cantica Sacra, 1662					Potter, Susan																											asu0660000032	THE  CARRELL  Volume 20 1979  Cantica Sacra, 1662  Richard Dering  a Bibliographical Description  by  Susan Potter  The Richter Library of the University of Miami possesses a set of partbooks of Richard Dering's Cantica  Sacra published by John Playford in England in 1662.  Since the collection appears to be the only complete set of this  printing in the United States, it is important to share bibliographical informaton about the partbooks. The only other  library in the United States known to have even a partial set  is the Library of Congress, which has the Cantus Primus  partbook alone. The location of other sets, either partial or  complete, of this printing are: Marsh's Library, Dublin;  Magdelen College, Cambridge; Cathedral Library, Durham;  British Museum, London; Bodleian Library, Oxford; Christ  Church, Oxford. In addition, the British Union-Catalogue  indicates that an imperfect copy is located in the Royal College  of Music, London.  The acquisitional history of the collection also is of special  interest to the Miami (Florida) community. The University  of Miami collection was a gift from the heirs of the estate of  Charles Deering. Infoifmation contained in a letter located  with the partbooks shows the set was purchased for Deering  in 1923 for £100 by B.F. Stevens and Brown, American  literary agents based in London; it was listed as item 956 in  the Harold Reeves Catalogue No. 38. The only rare music to  be found in that portion of Deering's library that was  managed by his grandchildren Charles Deering McCormick,  Brooks McCormick, and Roger McCormick, these materials  were first loaned to Richter Library and ultimately deeded  to the University of Miami on December 29, 1969. 	asu06600000320003001							66571096 Bytes	3889	5704	2662216450	RGB	8	600	asu06600000320003001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1599	1599	1600.jp2	/asu0660/image/1600.jp2
Cantica Sacra, 1662					Potter, Susan																											asu0660000032	Charles Deering was born in South Paris, Maine, on July  31, 1852. In 1869, he entered the United States Naval Academy, and following his commission, he served in Europe and  the Orient. He resigned from the Navy in 1881 to join the  family business, from which he retired in 1916. The Deering  Harvester Company was founded by William Deering, Charles  Deering's father. In 1902 it merged with several other companies to form the International Harvester Company. Charles  Deering died in Miami, Florida, on February 5, 1927.  Throughout his life, Deering was actively interested in the  creative arts. He spent one year in Paris studying portrait  painting, and subsequently founded Mar y Cel, an art center  near Barcelona, Spain, containing a collection of musical instruments, paintings, sculpture, rugs, furniture, embroidery,  tapestries, books, and pottery. The bulk of his collection was  subsequently transferred to his estate south of Miami, near  Cutler, Florida, and many items were donated to other individuals and institutions, including the Art Institute of Chicago, of which he was a trustee. (There is another Deering  estate in Miami, Florida, called "Vizcaya," a replica of a  fifteenth-century Italian palace. This estate was built and  once occupied by James Deering, Charles Deering's half  brother; it also contains numerous European art treasures.  Vizcaya was sold to Dade County in 1952 by the heirs of  James Deering, and is now open to the public.)  Deering was also interested in genealogy, and he attempted  to trace his own ancestry. Although a connection between  Charles Deering and Richard Dering was never established,  the genealogical study presumably kindled Charles Deering's  interest in the composer.  Richard Dering's Cantica Sacra 1662 are twenty-four  Latin motets for the Roman Catholic Church. Publisher John  Playford dedicated the collection to Queen Henrietta, a Catholic and the widow of Charles I who was beheaded for treason  in 1649. The music of the motets is contained in four part-  books. In 1588, such partbooks used Haultin typeface from  the fount designed by Pierre Haultin, a renowned French  typecutter of the sixteenth century. The Morley and Windet  founts were designed subsequently, and both were based on  the Haultin. All three were circulated from printer to printer  after 1608, and were acquired by William Godbid, Playford's 	asu06600000320004001							66453156 Bytes	3847	5756	3075791494	RGB	8	600	asu06600000320004001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1600	1600	1601.jp2	/asu0660/image/1601.jp2
Cantica Sacra, 1662					Potter, Susan																											asu0660000032	printer between the years 1658-1678. At this time, what  remained of the three separate founts was combined, and the  resulting mixed fount was used, especially in the printing of  religious music. Such a typeface characterizes the print in  Cantica Sacra 1662 (Plate 1).  The notes in the music of the collection are either square  or lozenge-shaped. Gaps between the segments of the staff  lines indicate that the music was printed by single impression  from moveable type. In the vocal partbooks, the text of each  motet is usually introduced by a decorated initial letter, although the designs of these ornamental letters are not always  identical for the same motet in the different partbooks. The  motet texts are printed in italic type with seriphs, and the  letters vary in thickness. A mixture of types is found on the  title, dedication, and index pages; the arrangement of roman,  italic, and blackletter types serves to emphasize important  elements, such as names or places.  The four partbooks which comprise the set in Richter  Library are labeled "Cantus Primus," "Cantus Secundus,"  "Bassus," and "Bassus Continuus." Nos. 1 through 14 are for  two voices, Nos. 15 through 24 for three voices; all are provided with basso continuo. The Cantus Primus and Bassus  partbooks contain vocal parts for all the motets; the Cantus  Secundus contains parts for Nos. 15 through 24 only. Also  included is a motet for four voices and basso continuo by  Alessandro Grandi, in which the Cantus Primus and Bassus  partbooks each contain one voice part, and the Cantus Secundus includes two separate parts arranged on facing pages.  The Cantus Primus has 14 leaves, the Cantus Secundus 8  leaves, the Bassus 12 leaves, and the Bassus Continuus 10  leaves. The partbooks are in folio format, each 28^ centimeters high and 18 centimeters wide. In all partbooks, signatures first appear at the bottom of the recto on which is  printed the first page of music, and on subsequent alternate  rectos, indicating that the leaves of the folio are gathered in  twos. The following signs are used: the Cantus Primus part-  book has the letters B, C, D, E, F, G; the Bassus, Bb, Cc,  Dd, Ee, Ff, G; the Cantus Secundus, Aaa, Bbb, Ccc; the  Bassus Continuus, Aaaa, Bbbb, Cccc, Dddd.

Since signatures usually commence with the  first letter of the alphabet, the absence of the sign "A" in  the Cantus Primus partbook and "Aa" in the Bassus partbook  is an indication that an additional signed gathering that was  once included in each of these two partbooks is now missing.  The bindings of the partbooks are vellum over board, and,  although brittle, they are little damaged. Running lengthwise  on the narrow spine of each volume is a title which includes  the name of the collection, Dering's name, date of publication,  and voice part; the lettering is gold-stamped on dark red  Moroccan leather.  Watermarks are present on the paper of the partbooks,  but these are only partly distinguishable. The marks usually  occur on alternate leaves near the center in either upright  or inverted position. There appear to be two similar marks.  The first and most prevalent measures 5 centimeters vertically and 2 centimeters at the widest point in the horizontal  dimension. The parts of the design which can be distinguished  are a crown or similar decoration at the top under which is a  cluster of circles and/or ellipses, a round vase-like central  portion, and a base. The second mark, rather faint, seems to  be a cluster of circles with stem-like protrusion at one end,  resembling a bunch of grapes. Watermarks from prints of  letters and articles of Charles I and Charles II dated between  1628 and 1649 bear close resemblance to the more frequent  watermark in Cantica Sacra 1662; the French "pot" watermark appears especially similar.  In the Cantus Primus, Cantus Secundus, and Bassus Continuus partbooks, title, dedication, and index pages are present  in that order. The title page of these partbooks includes the  name of the part, title of the work, and the designation that  the continuo part is intended for organ. The composer's name  and the explanation "Regiae Majestatis quondam Organistae"  follow. Beneath this is a picture, apparently of David with  his harp, followed by the imprint (Plate 2). The dedication  page contains the following inscription:  Illustrissimae/ et/ Excellentissimae/ Heroine/  Henriettae Mariae/ Reginae Doweragerae:/ Hae/  Cantiones Selectae/ Per/ Joannem Playfordum/  Servum humillimum/ Devotae sunt/ & Dicatae. 	asu06600000320007001							67910060 Bytes	3952	5726	1975013851	RGB	8	600	asu06600000320007001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1603	1603	1604.jp2	/asu0660/image/1604.jp2
Cantica Sacra, 1662					Potter, Susan																											asu0660000032	Although the Bassus partbook lacks all three of the above  preliminary pages, a substitute title page has been inserted  after the first end-paper in the partbook. There are other  instances of manuscript entries on added leaves, all of which  are of end-paper quality. Of particular interest is the first  of two leaves inserted immediately following the continuo  part of the Grandi motet in the Bassus Continuus partbook.  Written on the recto and verso of this leaf is the music of  motet No. 24, "Gloria Patri," in score form, with modern  clefs and original note values.  The music follows the index page immediately, and in  almost all cases, one motet appears on each page; in the  Bassus Continuus partbook, the music for two motets is often  printed on a single page, and frequently the music of one  motet is continued from the bottom of one page to the top  of the next. The number of voices, designation of voice parts,  and the composer's name are given in the headline of each  page, except in a few instances.  The pages of all the partbooks are somewhat discolored,  but there are only two tears, both of which occur in a portion  of the text. The ink from one side of a page tends to bleed  through to the other side, but the material is still legible.  The Bassus partbook appears generally more worn than the  other volumes.  The University of Miami is indeed fortunate to have  received the Cantica Sacra 1662 collection from the library  of Charles Deering. Because the music is complete in all the  partbooks, it has- been possible to transcribe the motets and  make them available for study. 	asu06600000320008001							67709224 Bytes	3928	5744	1114610026	RGB	8	600	asu06600000320008001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1604	1604	1605.jp2	/asu0660/image/1605.jp2

Their copy  is cut into lettering in some places, and the top line of  framework of title cut away. But they have correct printed  title to their "Bassus" (Part 3) and also the leaf following  that — Dedication to Henrietta Maria (obverse) Index on  the reverse, but you have leaves in each of parts "Primus"  "Secundus" and "Bassus Continuus" showing exactly the  same manner of Dedication and Index.

How John Leyden Died					Donovan, Laurence, 1927-																											asu0660000032	How John Leyden Died  LAURENCE DONOVAN  IT IS MY INTENTION in this essay to compare three  prose passages from about the turn of the 16th into the  17th century, all written within fifty years of each other,  which, through quite diverse in subject, treatment and motive,  and in genre and social milieu, seem to me to solve a common  aesthetic problem. The passages are from Sir Philip Sidney's  Arcadia, Thomas Nashe's The Unfortunate Traveller, and  John Donne's sermon, Death's Duel. For reasons of space I  shall consider only a paragraph from each of the first two;  but, since its relative brevity permits extended treatment and  it provides an admirable text for the consideration of the  aesthetic problem raised by all three works, I shall treat  Death's Duel somewhat at length.  Sidney's Arcadia and Nashe's The Unfortunate Traveller  represent opposite polarities in Renaissance prose fiction.  The former is inclined toward poetry, having been written  when prose fiction was intended, like poetry, to be interpreted  into sound, and having been designed for a courtly audience,  whose tatste was for fancifully treated, chivalric subjects.  The latter is closer to common speech, having been addressed  to more of a reading audience, composed of the rising, less  leisurely middle class, in whom a taste was being developed  for rugged and realistic subjects.  Of the two, Arcadia is the one in which, to the modern  reader, language and subject may appear least happily united.  The following excerpt displays the principal characteristics  of Sidney's style (as, indeed, any excerpt would, since his  style never varies) :  The sweet-minded Philoclea was in their degree of welldoing, to whom the not-knowing of evil serveth for a ground  of virtue, and hold their inward powers in better form with  an unspotted simplicity, than many, who rather cunningly  seek to know what goodness is, than willingly take unto  themselves the following of it. But as that sweet and simple  breath of heavenly goodness, is the easier to be altered, because it hath not passed through the worldly wickedness,  nor feelingly found the evil, that evil carries with it; so 	asu06600000320011001							67541232 Bytes	3923	5737	2990884161	RGB	8	600	asu06600000320011001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1607	1607	1608.jp2	/asu0660/image/1608.jp2

This, to the modern ear trained in naturalistic prose, is a  language poetic and artificial, sometimes sweetly flowing  and sometimes stilted, ever calling attention to itself. Although in this passage it has the appropriateness of describing a subject both precious and feminine, a young lady with  a courtly, mannered background, throughout Arcadia the  application of this language to all subjects, men, women, and  inanimate objects, generally eliminates for the reader with  a modern notion of realism any considerations of realistic  propriety. It is a language disobedient to the rhythms and  diction of common speech, which seems to hold its subject  (as well as its reader) in silvern thrall.  To begin with what seem faults, or to our ear cumber-  someness, the excerpt is made up structurally of two long  sentences, the first a neat balance of antithetical clauses, the  last a sustained period. The former is the more successful  since, given Philoelea's youth and station, there is a propriety  in setting forth the initial exposition of her situation aphoris-  tically, and the antithesis serves the aphorism; but the latter  becomes somewhat bogged at the middle, where pertinent but  subordinate matter interrupts at too great length the main  statement. To paraphrase a figure from Death's Duel, the first  part of the sentence does not piece well with the last because  it hearkens after the parenthesis that comes between. In addition, the comma-ed and semicoloned-off clauses, the "as that"  and "so now" constructions employed throughout tend to  call attention to the parts at the expense of the whole. Structurally, even in the aphorism, the passage impedes in its  complication and over-elaboration the larger, swifter movement we have learned to expect of prose, and, to a great  extent, diverts attention from the subject to the language.  The diction assists in this diversion. It is often stiff and  florid, and precious in its employment of assonance and allit-  10 	asu06600000320012001							66471728 Bytes	3873	5719	3224458617	RGB	8	600	asu06600000320012001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1608	1608	1609.jp2	/asu0660/image/1609.jp2

Hyper-poetic phrases ("that sweet and simple breath  of heavenly goodness"), jargony phrases ("without framing  out of her own will the forechoosing"), and such aural effects  as "well doing . . . not knowing," "cunningly . . . willingly,"  "heavenly goodness . . . worldly wickedness," "feelingly found,"  and "evil . . . evil" render the language autonomous. (Not  that these latter balances do not make meaningful emphases,  but they seem more at home in Bacon's essays than in an art  attempting the depiction of character; the influence of the  conduct manual stands between Sidney's language and psychological realism.  As to propriety of figures and images, this passage, with  its conventional and lovely simile of the fawn, reminiscent  of Wyatt, does not sin. Elsewhere in Arcadia, however, it is  another matter. Gynecia, after a plaintive soliloquy, makes  "a piteous war with her fair hair"; a spaniel shakes off river  water "as great men do their friends, now he had no further  cause to use it"; Miso and Mopsa take "the pure silver of  their bodies out of the ure of their garments," which "raiments went off to receive kisses of the ground"; and so  forth. Such metaphors and similes plunge the sustained,  highly poetic tone of Sidney's prose into the sentimental and  grotesque.  Yet, in the face of this brief overstatement of the evidence against Arcadia, Sidney's prose, and particularly in  the passage of which this excerpt is the beginning, has, for  the modern reader, its occasional power and attractiveness.  The development of statement in the excerpt, from the aphoristic opening to the concluding simile, which suddenly makes  poetically vivid the preceding generalzations, has a dramatic  Tightness about it, and the unfolding exposition of Philoclea's  budding relationship with Zelmane has a subtlety and psychological validity which grow partly out of the very "faults" I have  described. The elaborated and mannered clauses correspond  in tone and meaning to the slowly developing awareness of  the nature of her feelings that is besetting the mannered  Philoclea. The indirection of the syntax and diction parallel  her inability to do anything but feel vaguely toward an understanding of her problem. It is a language of refined analysis,  and if its subject is correspondingly refined, it works. Conduct manuals are highly dramatic to people for whom conduct  11 	asu06600000320013001							66896712 Bytes	3864	5769	1587238331	RGB	8	600	asu06600000320013001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1609	1609	1610.jp2	/asu0660/image/1610.jp2
How John Leyden Died					Donovan, Laurence, 1927-																											asu0660000032	is the essential ingredient of life. What we have here is a  kind of dramatic analysis (and partial self-analysis) of an  innocent and emotional subject who can only conceive of  herself in terms of "manners". Philoclea is an anticipation  of Isabel Archer and Milly Theale; and the way to understand the occasional power of Arcadia is through Henry  James. James' technique and subject are the same: passages  of intricate, elaborated general analysis of a mannered class,  Illuminated poetically by images as vivid as Sidney's fawn,  although James' images in their symbolic value and import  illustrate the different psychological functions to which Sidney's English was eventually brought and the differently-  conceived world they expressed. There is no real danger for a  fawn as conventionally frightened as Sidney's; but the wings  of James' dove are tender enough to be bruised, and his beast,  when it finally appears, is quite predatory.  This psychological rightness is to an extent present  throughout all of Arcadia — although it does not have the  dramatic validity of the Philoclea passage when the same  language is applied to scenery and spaniels — for the romanticized forest with its gallery of "unrealistic" characters is  an accurate projection of the courtly, rhetorical, mannered  and slowly fading society of and for whom Sidney wrote.  Thus, the "unfunctional adornments," even the "sentimental  and grotesque" imagery, depict something unfunctional, sentimental and grotesque (at least now to our sense of things) in  the society itself. It remained for the world to evolve another  mannered society, made precious by its isolation in the midst  of rougher and more virile rising classes, to validate once  more the Arcadian language and subject.  Nashe's The Unfortunate Traveller, to turn to the second  of the works I have elected to discuss, comes out of that rough  and virile class. It is, although the analogy is not exact, the  Hemingway to the Sidneyan James. The passage I have chosen  may, at first glance, seem uncharacteristic, for it is not directly involved in an immediate action as is the greater part  of Nashe's novel; and it does not employ the author's usual  direct, realistic description of a particular scene, but presents  its matter at a kind of fanciful, mythic remove; yet it is  typical:  12  \ 	asu06600000320014001							66802580 Bytes	3908	5696	2864567240	RGB	8	600	asu06600000320014001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1610	1610	1611.jp2	/asu0660/image/1611.jp2
How John Leyden Died					Donovan, Laurence, 1927-																											asu0660000032	This tale must at one time or other give up the ghost,  and as good now as stay longer; 1 would gladly rid my  hands of it cleanly, if I could tell how, for what with talking of cobblers, tinkers, rope-makers, botchers, and dirt-  daubers, the miark is clean out of my muse's mouth, & I am  as it were, more than duncified twixt divinity and poetry.  What is there more as touching this tragedy that you would  be resolved of?  Say quickly, for now is my pen on foot  J again. How John Leyden died, is that it? He died like a dog,  he was hanged & the halter paid for. For his companions,  I do they trouble you? I can tell you how they troubled some  men before, for they were all killed, & none escaped, no, not  so much as one to tell the tale of the rainbow. Hear what it  is to be Anabaptists, to be Puritans, to be villains; you may  be counted illuminate botchers for a while, but your end  will be, Good people, pray for us.  Here we have something substantially different from Arcadia.  As Sidney's language is slow-paced, musical but dense, finicky,  analytic, regarding human personality from a glazed, rhetorical remove, its meaning lying under a surface gloss like decorations under a ceramic layer, Nashe's is the opposite: paced  by the rhythms of common speech, operating on an immedi-  I ately clear and understandable level, fast-moving, more de  scriptive than analytic, generally invested with a sense of  j vigorous personality, seen in vivid, realistic terms. This is  not to say Nashe is without rhetoric, but the rhetoric has the  vital stamp of the rude tale-teller, displaying itself in forms  of, and conceiving man in terms of, action. The rhetoric of  Sidney is that of the portraitist. Not much happens in the  Arcadian forest, and the language pools with its subjects into  little friezes of soliloquy and description (of which the Philoclea passage is one example). Nashe, on the other hand, deals  in surges and counterpoints of events. His characters, and  especially that of Jack Wilton, his central personality, are  revealed in what they do and see done (and say while doing  and seeing) ; and the language embodies in its rhythms these  brisk movements.  The excerpt I have given demonstrates this. The language  is certainly rhetorical, but it is the dramatic conversational  rhetoric of question-and-answer, of an orator, or simply a  man talking. The sentences are short and racy, employing  ordinary, manageable speech rhythms. There are no parentheses or overly-prolonged suspensions of meaning, only the  13 	asu06600000320015001							66676964 Bytes	3860	5756	1914239801	RGB	8	600	asu06600000320015001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1611	1611	1612.jp2	/asu0660/image/1612.jp2
How John Leyden Died					Donovan, Laurence, 1927-																											asu0660000032	brief and titillating suspensions of question-and-answer that  are characteristic of common, vigorous speech. The diction  is neither stiff nor artificial. The rhythmic movement of the  syntax is ballasted by hard, descriptive words ("cobblers,  tinkers, rope-makers, botchers, and dirt-daubers," "he died  like a dog") ; and the occasional alliteration ("mark . . .  muse's mouth," "duncified twixt divinity and poetry") and  structural balances ("to be Anabaptists, to be Puritans, to be  villains") serve only to order and vary the movement. It is a  language imparting the flavor of Jack Wilton, just as Sidney's  language, to a degree, imparts the flavor of Philoclea.  I have said that this paragraph might seem uncharacteristic of Nashe since it avoids describing an action. We are  simply told by the author, who customarily revels in descriptions of death scenes, that John Leyden "died like a dog," and,  seemingly irritated that he had even to say this, Nashe rushes  on into the Earl of Surrey episode. Yet the passage is entirely  typical, and, in the larger movement of The Unfortunate  Traveller, occupies a vital structural position. Nashe has for  many pages been distracted from his description of the battle  between John Leyden and the Emperor and Duke of Saxony  to a prolonged attack on Anabaptists and fanatics in general  (with tedious arguments drawn from the Scriptures) ; and  now, impatient with himself, he turns his impatience back on  his readers in humor and mock anger, refusing to conclude  in any but an abrupt and cavalierish fashion the episode he  had begun. This brief paragraph brilliantly reestablishes the  rhythm of the narrative through balancing the prolonged  digression, asserts the characteristic personality of Wilton,  and through a foreshortening rhetorical device places the affair  of Leyden (and of all roguish men in this world of sometimes  meaningless and petty events) at a mythic and universal  remove. The flavor of the paragraph has something of that  of Pop-eye's death scene ("Fix my hair, Jack") and of the  beautiful elegiac description of Joe Christmas' death (where  the author uses similarly the device of stepping suddenly  outside of his narrative to comment oracularly upon it, producing a mythic remove). As Sidney points the way to James,  so Nashe, through Hemingway, and I suppose, somewhere  back there, by way of Sir Walter Scott, points the way to  Faulkner.  14 	asu06600000320016001							65794348 Bytes	3849	5696	415414406	RGB	8	600	asu06600000320016001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1612	1612	1613.jp2	/asu0660/image/1613.jp2
How John Leyden Died					Donovan, Laurence, 1927-																											asu0660000032	The language of John Donne's Death's Duel derives alone  neither from the rhetoric of the courtly world nor from the  common speech of London's streets, obtaining instead a powerful blend of the two, of the Ciceronian and the Senecan; or  perhaps one might say of involved scholastic argument and  sensual naturalistic diction and imagery. Death's Duel, as of  course its genre demands, is elevated in a manner to which  Nashe's prose could never aspire, yet it is dramatically and  poetically realistic in a sense that Sidney's language is not.  The sermon is built upon a structure of language as firm  and intricate as that described in its commanding image. This  image, drawn from architecture, is presented in the first  sentence of the opening paargraph, a paragraph which with  scholastic logic and poetic artistry defines the terms and  rhythms of the entire sermon:  Buildings stand by the benefit of their foundations that  susteine and support them, and of their butteresses that  comprehend and embrace them, and of their contignations  that knit and unite them. The foundations suffer them not  to sinke, the butteresses suffer them not to swerve, and the  contignation and knitting suffers them not to cleave; . . .  In these first sentences, the structural rhythm of Death's Duel  is established: it is a rhetorical flow of triads, the triad of  clauses in the second sentence neatly expanding and balancing  the rhythm of the triad in the first sentence. There is not  space in this essay for me to analyze in detail more than a  few of the structural rhythms in the sermon — I shall be  content with simply describing the argument as it unfolds in  terms of logic and imagery — but these opening sentences are  characteristic of the whole. Although the clauses are artificial  and balanced (and give us that pleasure), Donne subtly varies  the syntactical pattern from time to time to relieve any  monotony of design. In these sentences, for instance, apart  from the balanced triads, we have the balanced phrases "susteine and support," "comprehend and embrace," "knit and  unite;" but the whole figure is relieved and made rhythmically credible by the unexpected compounding of the subject  in the last clause: "and knitting" slows down, draws up and  completes the rhythm (at a point where the meaning has been  completed) ; whereas without it the ear would be monotonously propelled onward into the next sentence.

Donne next develops the figure of architecture in three  ways, fusing its three structural parts with three possible  semantical interpretations of his text: "And unto God the  (LORD) belong the issues of death, i.e. From death." To state  it briefly, God is the body of the building, which is to be  comprehended in three parts: (1) God, as the foundation,  which sustains and supports, gives us an issue and deliverance  from death; "this issue of death is liberatio a morte, a deliverance from death." (2) God, as buttress, which comprehends  and embraces, determines the "disposition and manner of our  death; this "issue of death, is liberatio in morte, A deliverance  in death." (3) God, as contignation, which knits and unites,  gives us death, through partaking of it Himself in Jesus, as  the way to salvation; "this issue of death, is liberatio per  mortem, a deliverance by death." This formulation — which,  by the way, extends the triadic rhythm by separating the body  of the first paragraph into three movements, each musically  related and defined by the repetition of certain phrases —  is brilliantly rounded off when the original architectural figure is expanded into the three parts of the Godhead:  . . . First, as the God of power, the Almighty Father rescues his servants from the jawes of death; And then as the  God of mercy, the glorious Sonne rescued us, by taking  upon himselfe this issue of death: And then betweene these  two, as the God of comfort, the holy Ghost rescues us from  all discomfort by his blessed impressions before hand, that  what manner of death soever be ordeined for us, yet this  exitus mortis shall bee introitus in vitam, our issue in death  shall be an entrance into everlasting life.  This first paragraph (as I have suggested parenthetically  above) is more tightly reasoned than the remainder of the  sermon, and properly so, for it provides the argument which  is to be dramatized and imaged forth in the remainder, just  as Sidney generalizes about Philoclea and then images his  generalizations in the figure of the fawn.

The first paragraph, although tight and  involved in initial definition, is a microcosm of the sermon  as a whole. It presents and solves Donne's basic aesthetic  problem — and that, not incidentally, of Sidney and Nashe:  how to render sensual and dramatic mere logical statement.  Donne, in one passage late in Death's Duel, expresses his  awareness of this very problem. He writes, in exhorting his  flock to think on the crucifixion:  Our meditation of his death should be more viscerall and  affect us more because it is of a thing already done. The  ancient Romans had a certain tendernesse and detestation  of the name of death, they could not name death, no, not in  their wills. There they could not say Si mori contigerit, but  si quid humanitus contingat, not if, or when I die, but when  the course of nature is accomplished upon me. To us that  speak daily of the death of Christ (he was crucified, dead,  and buried) can the memory of the mention of our own  death be irksome or bitter? There are in these latter times  amongst us, that name death freely enough, and the death  of God, but in blasphemous oaths and execrations. Miserable men, who shall therefore bee said never to have named  Jesus, because they have named him too often . . . And wee  are afraid to speake to the great men of this world of their  death, but nourish in them a vaine imagination of immortality, and immutability. But bonum est nobis esse hie (as  Saint Peter said there) It is good to dwell here, in this  consideration of his death . . .  This passage, expressed in the terms of a preacher who is  attempting to make his hearers realize fully the meaning of  Christ's death and, by analogy, their own, figures forth the  aesthetic problem posed for Donne in Death's Duel. He must  make his text not only logically clear, but he must see to it  that it is emotionally felt. He must illustrate with whatever  poetical and rhetorical devices he has at hand the human  meaning implicit  in  God's  architecturally  logical  ultimate  17 	asu06600000320019001							66997600 Bytes	3886	5745	2759926757	RGB	8	600	asu06600000320019001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1615	1615	1616.jp2	/asu0660/image/1616.jp2

What can be scholastically defined must be  made "viscerall"; the abstract udeath of Christ" must be transformed into the contextually surprising and emphatic "he  was crucified, dead, and buried" Vagueness, abstraction, and  empty repetition must give way to living images, metaphors  and figures, the hard bite of common expressions against the  elevated style which dominates, and the power of this elevated  style itself when ballasted with the former.  As Death's Duel proceeds, this is what happens. Structurally, the remainder of the sermon deals with an extended  consideration of each of the three issues of death set up in  the earlier figure. The first "acceptation" of the preposition  is the issue from death. This Donne projects in a conception  of man's life as a pilgrimage from stage to stage, each stage  a "death" leading to the next "death" and ultimately to salvation. The images are extended and vivid. Man's natural  state of imperfection and decay is first known in the womb,  which is a kind of death:  . . . for in our mothers wombe we are dead so, as that  wee do not know wee live, not so much as wee doe in our  sleepe, neither is there any grave so close, or so putrid a  prison, as the wombe would be unto us, if we stayed in it  beyond our time, or dyed there before our time. In the  grave the wormes doe not kill us, wee breed and feed, and  then kill these wormes which wee our selves produced. In the  wombe the dead child kills the Mother that conceived it, and  is a murtherer, nay a parricide, even after it is dead.  The idea of the womb as a prison and a grave, of the child  as a murderer, makes Adam's sin almost prenatal, introducing Donne's point that life from the very beginning is a death  created by Adam's fall, and man, if he is to have salvation,  must remain persistently aware of this death, the physical  reminder of his sin. This conception of the dead child, conveyed in a picture of putrescence and wormy graves, must  have had much force in a time when childbirth was not so  easily managed (or avoided entirely) as now. Donne, with all  the ingenuity his earlier poetic practice taught him, develops  the figure of the womb, interpreting suggestively the anatomical state of the unborn child in terms of man's fallen state:  In the wombe wee have eyes and see not, eares and heare  not; There in the wombe wee are fitted for workes of dark-  18 	asu06600000320020001							65904384 Bytes	3848	5707	2497634379	RGB	8	600	asu06600000320020001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1616	1616	1617.jp2	/asu0660/image/1617.jp2
How John Leyden Died					Donovan, Laurence, 1927-																											asu0660000032	nes, all the while deprived of light: And there in the wombe  wee are taught cruelty, by being fed with blood . . .  From the figure of the womb, from which man must be delivered if he is to attain ultimate salvation, Donne moves by  association to a consideration of life as pilgrimage; the womb  is likened to a ship, and Noah's ark and Moses' ark of bulrushes are mentioned as vessels from which God delivered  man. Donne then writes:  But then this exitus a morte, is but introitus in mortem,  this issue, this deliverance from that death, the death of the  wombe, is an entrance, a delivering over to another death,  the manifold deathes of this world. Wee had a winding  sheete in our Mothers wombe, which growes with us from  our conception, and wee come into the world, wound up in  that winding sheet, for wee come to seeke a grave . . .  There is no denying the force of the image of the winding  sheet, nor of the dramatic rhythm of these lines. (Although  I have no space to devote to the subtleties of Donne's art in  this rather rapid run-through sermon, I would like to point  out here the manner in which the structure of this passage  serves its meaning. The second sentence, presenting a feeling  of almost musical sadness, is doubly effective in breaking  away from the broken-up syntax of the first; the last word  in the first sentence, "world," seems to be an alliterating  prelude to this break-away. The soft assonance and gentle  alliteration provide the second sentence with a singular  beauty, and the arrangement of its parts and occasional near-  repetition of phrase actually produce the effect rhythmically  of being wound in a winding sheet.) Immediately after this  passage, in an image almost Blakeian, Donne pictures strikingly the analogy he draws between the womb and the grave:  . . . wee celebrate our owne funeralls with cries, even at  our birth . . .  After this, Donne, having moved from womb to ark, recalls  his initial figure from architecture:  . . . There are many mansions, divers and durable, so  that if a man cannot possesse a martyrs house, (he hath  shed no blood for Christ) yet hee may have a Confessors,  he hath bene ready to glorifie God in the shedding of his  blood. And if a woman cannot possesse a virgins house (she  hath embrac'd the holy state of marriage) yet she may have  a matrons house, she hath brought forth and brought up  children in the feare of God . . .  19 	asu06600000320021001							66917580 Bytes	3880	5747	3072107727	RGB	8	600	asu06600000320021001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1617	1617	1618.jp2	/asu0660/image/1618.jp2
How John Leyden Died					Donovan, Laurence, 1927-																											asu0660000032	The figure is carried forward to serve the idea of man's life  as a pilgrimage:  . . . in my fathers house, in heaven there are many  mansions; but here upon earth the sonne of man hath not  where to lay his head . . . Here wee have no continuing city,  nay no cottage that continues, nay no persons, no bodies  that continue . . .  And is extended further:  . . . yet he hath the keys of death, and hee can let me out  at that dore, that is, deliver me from the manifold deaths  of this world . . .  This section of Death's Duel — and it is not possible for me  to do more here than suggest its developing tone and argument— concludes, after a discussion of why Christ's body  did not partake of corruption in the grave, with a picture of  man's "corruption and putrifaction . . . vermiculation and  incineration" visceral enough for the strongest stomach:  . . . Miserable riddle, when the same worme must bee my  mother, and my sister, and my selfe. Miserable incest, when  I must bee maried to my mother and my sister, and bee both  father and mother to my owne mother and sister, beget and  beare that worme which is all that miserable penury; when  my mouth shall be filled with dust, and the worme shall  feed, and feed sweetely upon me . . . Even those bodies that  were the temples of the holy Ghost, come to this dilapidation, to ruine, to rubbidge, to dust . . . That that Monarch,  who spred over so many nations alive, must in his dust lie  in a corner of that sheete of lead, and there, but so long as  that lead will laste, and that privat and retir'd man, that  thought himselfe his owne for ever, and never came forth,  must in his dust of the grave bee published, and (such are  the revolutions of the graves) bee mingled with the dust of  every high way, and of every dunghill, and swallowed in  every puddle and pond . . .  In this series of quotations, drawn from the long morbid  passage on man's physical decay after death which ends the  consideration of the first issue of death, are displayed almost  all of Donne's devices to move his listeners to visualize the  meaning of death. As in the womb the theme of parricide,  here the theme of incest is introduced, the marriage of mother  and father and sister with the dead man in the worm being  horribly dwelt upon. This, as the latter did the idea of birth,  brings the idea of death close to home, putting it in terms  which are domestic and outrageous.

How John Leyden Died					Donovan, Laurence, 1927-																											asu0660000032	a conceit based on the physiological nature of the prenatal  state, so this figure is a conceit based on the disintegration  and dispersion of the body after death. The phrase "my  mouth shall be filled with dust" draws up a graphic picture  which such an expression as "dust unto dust" does not, as  does the worm which does not just feed but feeds "sweetely"  — a tasted dryness and a smelt putrefaction are evoked by  these descriptive phrases. In "the temples of the holy Ghost"  Donne recalls his architectural image again, and in the concluding figure of the "Monarch" and the "private and retir'd  man" balances the image of a monarch "who spred over so  many nations" only to be contracted in the grave with the  image of a private, unpublic person who was "published" in  the grave — a conceit neatly based upon the sorts of burial  these men would have.  As I have tried to illustrate by these excerpts, Donne's  argument develops throughout the latter portion of Death's  Duel in a loose, associational fashion, the object being to  portray in terms of emotional impact what in the first paragraph has been scholastically defined. The argument is not  as tightly knit as there, but deploys over the whole range of  circumstances in man's life, from womb to grave, for whatever conceits, figures, images or simple descriptions serve to  render death and decay real and intimate to the listener.  Donne does not abandon his original figure — he extends the  image of architecture, he repeats phrases from the semantical  analysis of the first paragraph and from its elaboration in  terms of the Godhead — but he is less interested in such "con-  tignations" than in a ranging sequence of pictures of death,  cumulative in effect, a persistent imaged dwelling upon death  that will move the listener to feel the argument and perceive  his human state. Only if the listener forgoes the "vaine imagination of immortality, and immutability" and sees man's state  for what it is —  . . . this whole world is but an universall churchyard,  but one common grave, and the life and motion that the  greatest persons have in it, is but as the shaking of buried  bodies in the grave, by an earth-quake.  — can he appreciate the need for salvation, and the wonder  of a God who can furnish him issue from such death.

How John Leyden Died					Donovan, Laurence, 1927-																											asu0660000032	draws up his long dissertation on death by returning to his  thesis, now rendered less abstract by that dissertation:  . . . and yet Domini Domini sunt exitus mortis, unto God  the Lord belong the issues of death, and by recompacting  this dust into the same body, and reanimating the same body  with the same soule, hee shall in a blessed and glorious  resurrection give mee such an issue from this death, as shal  never passe into any other death, but establish me into a  life that shall last as long as the Lord of life himself.  This, despite its generality, is no longer an abstract theological promise. The dust has been tasted in the mouth.  Donne next considers the second "acceptation" of his  Scriptural text: the issue of death is a deliverance in death.  His thesis  That it belongs to God, and not to man to passe a judgement upon us at our death, or to conclude a dereliction on  Gods part upon the manner thereof.  is presented in the same graphic terms, here drawn from the  physiological state of the dying man:  . . . wee use to comfort our selfe in the death of a friend,  if it be testified that he went away like a Lambe, that is,  without any reluctation. But, God knowes, that he may bee  accompanied with a dangerous damp and stupefaction, and  insensibility of his present state.  But it is in the final section of Death's Duel, that dealing  with the issue of death as a deliverance by death, that Donne  attains his grandest sweep of language and his most striking  poetic impact. His subject is the death of Christ and, as the  passage from this part which I have already quoted indicates,  his intention is that this "meditation of his death should be  more viscerall. . . ." Donne achieves this in several ways. I  cannot here indicate all of them without extensive quotations  — especially the total cumulative effect of the syntactical  rhythms — but his principal device is to suddenly address his  audience directly, and parallel the last twenty-four hours of  His life with the last twenty-four hours of their life:  Take in the whole day from the houre that Christ received the passeover upon Thursday, unto the houre in  which hee died the next day. Make this present day that  day in thy devotion, and consider what hee did, and remember what you have done. Before hee instituted and celebrated the Sacrament . . . hee proceeded to that act of humility, to wash his disciples feete, even Peters, who for a  22 	asu06600000320024001							65717352 Bytes	3856	5679	442147687	RGB	8	600	asu06600000320024001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1620	1620	1621.jp2	/asu0660/image/1621.jp2

If so and not else thou hast spent that first  part of his last day in a conformity with him. After the  Sacrament hee spent the time till night in prayer, in preaching, in Psalmes; Hast thou considered that a worthy re-  ceaving of the Sacrament consists in a continuation ofholi-  nesse after, as wel as in a preparation before? If so, thou  hast therein also conformed thy selfe to him, so Christ spent  his time till night . . .  The dramatic effect of this is apparent. Tracing the steps of  Christ from the passover to the crucifixion, Donne relates,  in a series of searching personal questions, the steps of each  member of his audience during the twenty-four hours beginning Lent. The immediacy attained by Nashe in directly addressing his readers is here attained, for higher ends, by the  same device. In addition to this dramatic technique (which,  set against the tightly reasoned opening paragraph, concludes  the sermon's movement from the abstract and logical to the  specific and personal), Donne, developing an image of blood  and tears (as set against the image of dust which pervades  the first section), portrays Christ in terms as direct and  sensual as those of Crashaw:  He was Baptized out of his love, and his love determined  not there. He mingled blood with water in his agony and  that determined not his love; hee wept pure blood, all his  blood at all his eyes, at all his pores, in his flagellation and  thornes . . . and these expressed, but these did not quench  his love ... In that time and in those prayers was his  agony and bloody sweat. I will hope that thou didst pray,  but not every ordinary and customary prayer, but prayer actually accompanied with shedding of teares, and dispositively  in a readiness to shed blood for his glory in necessary cases,  puts thee into a conformity with him . . . There now hangs  that sacred Body upon the Crosse, rebaptized in his owne  teares and sweat and embalmed in his owne blood alive.  There are those bow ells of compassion, which are so conspicuous, so manifested, as that you may see them through his  wounds . . . There wee leave you in that blessed dependancy,  to hang upon him that hangs upon the Crosse, there bath in  his teares, there suck at his woundes, and lie down in peace  in his grave, till hee vouchsafe you a resurrection, and an  ascension into that Kingdome, which hee hath purchasfd for  you, with the inestimable price of his incorruptible blood.  23 	asu06600000320025001							66417268 Bytes	3880	5704	1340379991	RGB	8	600	asu06600000320025001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1621	1621	1622.jp2	/asu0660/image/1622.jp2
How John Leyden Died					Donovan, Laurence, 1927-																											asu0660000032	These final powerful images, of the tears of man and the blood  of the Saviour, contignatory, knitting and uniting man and  God — this final dramatic picture, which does not breach  decorum but enlarges it in its effort to figure forth the crucifixion in intimate and realistic terms — require, I think, no  commentary.  I have endeavored to suggest in this essay that each of  these three prose passages from Sidney, Nashe, and Donne,  despite its diversity from the others, is relatively successful  if viewed in terms of its settings and motives. I say relatively,  because, for instance, Sidney's successes are uneven and of a  different order, certainly, from Donne's (although in Sidney's  case aesthetic success by objective standards is not easy to  determine, since his excesses and failures seem to embody  accurately certain characteristics of his social milieu; and  objective standards, difficult enough to determine if even  really possible, must make some concession to the form of  Sidney's art as it reflects his mileiu), yet all three works,  in their own terms, seem to solve a primary aesthetic problem which appears basic to art: they make a general specific.  How to best make the reader feel Philoclea's situation, how  to most dramatically convey the news of Leyden's death, how  to make the flock feel the meaning of a Scriptural text —  these are aesthetic problems of a common nature. Each of the  writers came to a different solution. Sidney, threading his  late Renaissance tapestry, working with a subtle yet undy-  namic fabric, needed only to call up the conventional figure  of a fawn. Donne, in telling how Christ died, employed in his  dynamic text every conceivable device of direct description  and sensualized rhetoric to make the picture vivid to his  listeners. And, utilizing a technique exactly opposite from  Donne's, Nashe, in telling how John Leyden died, did not  really tell at all; but because, like Sidney and Donne, his  language was obedient to the tone and rhythm of his milieu,  his genre, and his subject, told very well indeed.

The Florida Stories of Kirk Monroe					Leonard, Irving A. (Irving Albert), 1896-1996																											asu0660000017	The Florida Stories of Kirk Munroe  Irving A. Leonard  T;he 1880s, 1890s, and the turn of the century were the  flush times of story-writing for young people in the  United States. St. Nicholas, Youth's Companion, Harpers Young People (later Harper's Round Table), American  Boy, and numerous other magazines were flourishing, while innumerable writers of boys' stories enjoyed the heyday of their  popularity. Among the many entertaining the youth of the land  with tales of adventure and rise to fortune were: G. A. Henty,  Horatio Alger, Edward S. Ellis, writing in the manner of Fenni-  more Cooper, and Edward S. Stratemeyer, who made the manufacture of boys' literature a kind of industry with his tales of  the Spanish American war campaigns in 1898. With hired writers  and under various pseudonyms, he turned out series after series  of the Rover Boys, the Motor Boys, the Four Boy Hunters, and  the Tom Swift stories. The prolific pens of these and many other  purveyors of vicarious adventure transported readers to all  parts of the globe and periods of history. Florida, then retaining  the lure of an exotic frontier, claimed a share of this attention.  In the 1880s James Otis wrote Raising the "Pearl," which recounts a cruise up the twisty course of the Caloosahatchee river  to Lake Okeechobee, and also The Castaways, or On the Florida  Reef; in the 1890s St. George Rathborne published The Boy  Cruisers, or Paddling in Florida, and many others exploited  similar themes. But whether his fiction dealt with Florida or  the world at large, the best of these writers was Kirk Munroe  (1850-1930), whose base of operations for forty years was  Coconut Grove on Biscayne Bay.  Journalist, editor, and author, Kirk Munroe was first of all  a lover of adventure in the great out-of-doors, with an "inextinguishable wanderlust" that propelled him to odd corners of the  world, providing the experience that gave an authentic ring to  so many of his stories. Born of missionary parents on the Indian  frontier of Wisconsin and educated mainly at Cambridge, Mass.,  his life of adventure began in 1867, while still in his teens, with  •  3  L 	asu06600000170005001							65841300 Bytes	3885	5646	2444398644	RGB	8	600	asu06600000170005001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1630	1630	1631.jp2	/asu0660/image/1631.jp2

Restless on returning to Cambridge, he soon set off on a like mission in the  Northwest, the Dakotas, Montana, and Washington. Besides  visiting all parts of the United States, he later girdled the globe  twice and journeyed to such outlying regions as Alaska, the Far  East, islands of the Pacific, and Hudson Bay, gathering material  for journalistic articles and stories. He was a sportsman in the  best sense of the term, loving camping, hunting, sailing, and  fishing; and much enthusiasm he devoted to the new sport of  bicycling, organizing the New York Bicycle Club and, in 1880,  founding the League of American Wheelmen. But his keenest  pleasure was canoeing and sailing, and it was these diversions  that attracted him to Florida so strongly that he made its southern part his permanent home.  It appears that he first came to this still thinly inhabited region in 1881 for a visit at Mandarin on the St. Johns river where  Harriet Beecher Stowe of Uncle Tom's Cabin fame had her  winter home. Kirk Munroe's sister had recently married the  youngest son of the novelist, and this relationship-by-marriage  had, apparently, brought an invitation to come to Florida. The  future writer of boys' stories, then Commodore of the New York  Canoe Club, brought his beloved Psyche, a fourteen foot sailing  canoe, and made a 1,600 mile cruise in Florida waters that was  followed by similar journeys in subsequent winter seasons. Late  in 1883 he came to settle at Lake Worth with his bride, daughter of Amelia Barr, a novelist, but in 1886 the couple moved to  Coconut Grove where they bought a lot and built their house  "Scrububs." Here, after summers in the North or after distant  travels, Kirk Munroe invariably returned for long seasons to  write his books and articles.  About a hundred feet back of his house stood a water tower,  and to its upper part commanding a fine prospect of Biscayne  Bay he repaired daily to do his writing. Even before his first  visit to Florida he had resolved to become a free lance writer,  for he then resigned the editorship of Harper's Young People,  which he had assumed in 1879 after three years as a New York 	asu06600000170006001							64371264 Bytes	3787	5664	2493115782	RGB	8	600	asu06600000170006001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1631	1631	1632.jp2	/asu0660/image/1632.jp2
The Florida Stories of Kirk Monroe					Leonard, Irving A. (Irving Albert), 1896-1996																											asu0660000017	Sun reporter. Since Florida was then attracting its first important wave of tourists, invalids, and settlers, he edited a kind  of guide, The Florida Annual, Impartial and Unsectional, for  the years 1884, 1885, and 1886, while publishing articles about  the State in various periodicals. But already he had begun to  write the thirty-five book-length stories that were to win him  wide renown, and Florida inspired the first of them. In the 1890s  his name became a household one throughout the country for,  from 1890 to 1900, appeared twenty-five of his books as well as  scores of journalistic articles. While the majority of his tales  dealt with contemporary life and drew heavily upon his personal experiences, about a third of them were set in other historical periods. Florida was the locale of eight, two of which  were placed in its past; all but one were published early in his  story-telling career, that is, from 1886 to 1896.  Kirk Munroe wrote his first book at Newport, Florida, on the  St. Marks river in the spring of 1883. This hamlet, then nearly  deserted, had enjoyed a brief importance that withered even  before the Civil War. The writer's presence there seems explained by the fact that Charles Beecher, brother of Harriet  Beecher Stowe, had acquired a plantation at Newport in 1867  as a serious enterprise in growing pecan trees. Beecher had come  to Florida as State Superintendent of Agriculture and Public Instruction in the "carpet bag" government, in which office his  efficient administration earned the respect even of his opponents.  In 1874 his illustrious sister visited him in Newport and, nine  years later, his nephew-by-marriage spent the spring months  there, presumably on his estate, writing WAKULLA. A STORY  OF ADVENTURE IN FLORIDA, serialized from August,  1884, to January, 1885 in the Harper's Young People that he  had so recently edited. The following year, 1886, Harpers  Brothers published it as a book with twenty-five illustrations at  sixty cents a copy.  Borrowing the title from the nearby famous Wakulla Spring,  Kirk Munroe wrote a simple tale of the experiences of the Elmer  family of Maine, parents and a teen age son and daughter, in  reclaiming an abandoned estate called "Bang's Place" (the  Beecher plantation?) located in the vicinity of Newport Springs. 	asu06600000170007001							65562484 Bytes	3879	5632	2221395239	RGB	8	600	asu06600000170007001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1632	1632	1633.jp2	/asu0660/image/1633.jp2
The Florida Stories of Kirk Monroe					Leonard, Irving A. (Irving Albert), 1896-1996																											asu0660000017	By establishing a rope ferry across St. Marks river, constructing  a dam near this sulphur spring, and by building a mill to grind  corn and saw lumber, the northern family instilled new life in  the storeless village of twenty houses "many of which were in a  dilapidated condition; only two were occupied by white families, the rest of the population being colored." Recalling the  community's former prosperity, the author writes: "Then a fine  plank-road reached back from Wakulla a hundred miles into  the country," a detail that identifies his "Wakulla" with Newport. Numerous novel adventures befall the Elmer boy in his  new surroundings, including a fall into one of the many sinkholes of the area while hunting at night with a firepan of glowing coals to dazzle his game. With suitable suspense the story  recounts the youth's frightening experience of being washed  through an underground passage to emerge at another spot.  WAKULLA'S best pages, perhaps, describe a picnic to celebrate the completion of the lumber mill in which the entire small  community, Negroes and whites, happily share in the rural festivities. The touches of folklore and depiction of local ways are  attractive features of a conventional story that was reprinted  many times.  But it was his second book that catapulted Kirk Munroe into  fame for well over a generation as a writer of boys' stories. THE  FLAMINGO FEATHER, serialized in Harper's Young People  in 1886 and issued as a book with twenty illustrations the following year, was a tale of the French Huguenots in sixteenth  century Florida. Of all the author's books it enjoyed the most  sustained popularity and the longest life. Edition after edition  appeared, culminating in a beautiful de luxe printing with handsome illustrations in 1923. Even as late as 1949, nineteen years  after the author's death, a William Kottmeyer adapted it as a  text in the Everyreader series of the Webster Publishing Company at St. Louis.  The hero of THE FLAMINGO FEATHER is Rene de Veaux,  the sixteen year old scion of a noble family who joins his uncle,  the Chevalier Rene de Laudonniere in an expedition to establish in Florida "a sanctuary for our blessed Protestant faith" at  •  6 	asu06600000170008001							64811848 Bytes	3819	5655	3918804275	RGB	8	600	asu06600000170008001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1633	1633	1634.jp2	/asu0660/image/1634.jp2
The Florida Stories of Kirk Monroe					Leonard, Irving A. (Irving Albert), 1896-1996																											asu0660000017	the mouth of the St. Johns river. The tale is replete with the  adventures of young Rene among Indians, friendly and hostile,  of underground passages, pursuits, captures, and escapes as  mutiny and disaster overtake the French Huguenots, presently  massacred as heretics by Spaniards under Pedro Menendez de  Aviles who planted a settlement at St. Augustine. Rescued by  Indian friends from the outlaw peoples of the Okefenokee  Swamp anachronistically called "Seminoles," young Rene becomes chief of the peaceful Alachuas, wearing the flamingo  feather in his hair as a symbol of office. Three years later French  ships arrive at the mouth of the St. Johns, and the white chieftain  Rene discovers Spanish treasure in the ruins of the Huguenot  Fort Caroline as well as some papers. He then returns to France  to restore the family fortune and the honor of his beloved uncle,  Laudonniere. For the historical background of this adventure-  packed story Kirk Munroe seemingly relied upon Francis Park-  man's early work Pioneers of France in the New World — a set  of Parkman's writings was listed among the author's effects after  his death.  Kirk Munroe's next Florida story DELTA BIXBY, short in  length and published in 1889 by Harper Brothers, together with  an unrelated story, may well have been inspired by his recent  settling at Coconut Grove, for Biscayne Bay is the scene of  action. In circumstances not unlike the author's, a sixteen year  old youth in a small Wisconsin community yearns to travel and  see the world. His father, with pious counsels, consents and, in  due course, the lad takes to the sea and becomes marooned on  Cape Florida "on which stands the tall, white shaft of an  abandoned lighthouse" at which the author, perhaps, gazed as  he wrote. His young hero Delta (whose father named his four  children in the order of the Greek alphabet) takes refuge in  this structure and presently sights a small boat drifting by with  a black woman and a white infant huddled in it. Rescuing these  strange passengers with whom he can not converse as the black  nurse speaks Spanish, Delta seeks aid by lighting a beacon in  the abandoned lighthouse. This unwonted illumination attracts  the attention of a small band of Seminole Indians who carry  •  7 	asu06600000170009001							65908056 Bytes	3880	5659	2330575522	RGB	8	600	asu06600000170009001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1634	1634	1635.jp2	/asu0660/image/1635.jp2

"Old Aleck," a true life Indian in Kirk Munroe's time and allegedly 140 years old, lives among them* Presently all ends happily as the mystery of the black nurse and  child is cleared up and the infant is restored to its New York  parents. In the Horatio Alger tradition Delta is rewarded by  the grateful father, a successful businessman, with a lucrative  position in Cuba. Many details in this trite story indicate the  author's first hand observations and experiences acquired during  his early residence on Biscayne Bay.  Rivaling THE FLAMINGO FEATHER in popularity was  CANOEMATES. A STORY OF THE FLORIDA REEF AND  EVERGLADES, serialized in the 1892-1893 winter numbers  of Harper's Young People and published in the latter year as a  book. Kirk Munroe's greatest passion was canoeing and sailing,  and this story was something of a distillation of his own varied  experiences in Florida waters and along the Keys. A yachtsman  as well as a canoeist, he had acquired a sailboat named Allapata  after coming to Coconut Grove where, in 1887, he organized  the Biscayne Yacht Club, of which he was secretary as late as  1922. During the winter of 1890-1891, when he was probably  writing CANOEMATES, he cruised in the Allapata around the  tip of Florida to the Ten Thousand Islands and the lower west  coast. This excursion may have inspired in part the second half  of CANOEMATES.  Briefly, it consists of two main episodes, the first being the  adventures of two youthful canoemates paddling from Key West  among the islands — one canoe is significantly named Psyche  after the author's own. Many pages recount incidents as castaways on Lignum Vitae Key, a still unspoiled islet, described as  "covered with an almost impenetrable forest growth, and concealed by this are ancient stone walls, of which no one knows  the origin or date."  In the second episode the boys join an expedition on the  "schooner rigged sharpie" Transit of the Coast Survey to explore  the Everglades "to ascertain their value as a permanent reservation for the Florida Seminoles."

Kirk Munroe's fondness for his own Psyche  doubtless moved him, in closing the story, to have his young  hero declare: "Whatever boats I may own I will never part with  that dear canoe as long as I live."  Story after story followed in the 1890s with settings in varied  parts of the world and in the past, but now and then Florida  provided inspiration. THE CORAL SHIP. A STORY OF THE  FLORIDA REEF appeared in 1893. In this tale an old manuscript starts a youth on a quest of a wrecked Spanish galleon  off the Keys. Weird sounds emitted by a blowhole reveal a  cavern hiding a coral covered treasure ship. After many adventures he recovers a golden vase from it whose value more  than pays off the mortgage on the home of the hero's widowed  mother. If the plot is hackneyed and the story banal, THE  CORAL SHIP is prophetic of recent discoveries of sunken ships  on the Florida coast and precious objects.  The next two stories of Kirk Munroe's series tended to stress  the evils and injustices suffered by the Seminoles in his own time  as well as the past. His sympathy for these unfortunate Indians  was strong, for he had made many visits to their encampments  in the Everglades where they warmly reciprocated his friendship.. A spring bubbled up on his waterfront property at Coconut  Grove and the Seminoles often frequented this source of fresh  water, camping nearby; often they helped themselves to Kirk  Munroe's vegetable garden, an abuse which he cheerfully forgave. In 1894 appeared a short book and clearly not one of  his best entitled BIG CYPRESS. THE STORY OF AN EVERGLADES HOMESTEAD, published by W. A. Wilde & Co., of  Boston. Possibly the Florida boom of the 1920s moved this  publisher to reissue it over thirty years later in 1926 under a  different name: IN THE HEART OF THE EVERGLADES.  Essentially, this tale is a protest against the land-grabbing  proclivities of the white man as practiced against the Seminoles.  A virtuous Northern family refuses to be a party to such illegal  seizures and a grateful Seminole rewards them with a choice 	asu06600000170011001							65823592 Bytes	3880	5653	3972743674	RGB	8	600	asu06600000170011001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1636	1636	1637.jp2	/asu0660/image/1637.jp2

The story is an inferior WAKULLA which depends even more unrealistically on the long  arm of coincidence to tie together its loose strands.  A more convincing indictment of perfidy is the next to the  last of Kirk Munroe's Florida books THROUGH SWAMP AND  GLADE. A TALE OF THE SEMINOLE WAR (1896) that  grew out of his indignation at the persecution still endured by  these Indians. In this story, with deep feeling and considerable  historical accuracy, he describes incidents of the war against  the Seminoles from 1835 to 1842, including the treachery of  military authorities in dealing with Osceola, the desperate resistance of his followers, the battles fought, and the imprisonment  of this Indian leader and of Coacoochee. The latter is the hero  and slave-catchers the villains of this tale through which runs a  love interest.  With this forceful denunciation of injustice and an implicit  plea in behalf of the Seminoles Kirk Munroe closed his series  of fiction books about his adopted State except for BRETHREN  OF THE COAST, (1900) a story of reefs, wrecks, and pirates  along the Keys. An occasional article relating to Florida appeared subsequently in widely read magazines of the time but after  THROUGH SWAMP AND GLADE, published in 1896 and a  decade after WAKULLA, the region seemed to provide little  inspiration for his stories. That same year of 1896 the railroad  had reached Miami and Biscayne Bay's days as a frontier had  ended. As the area grew more populous and the conditions of  the life he loved changed drastically, his creative fire began to  burn unsteadily and 1905 saw the publication of his last book  of fiction For the Mikado inspired by the recent Russo-Japanese  war. During the remaining twenty-five years of his life he virtually ceased to write, though his books continued to appear  in new editions and bring royalties. Gradually the spirit of adventure and even the "inextinguishable wanderlust" waned  and he settled more and more into a sedentary existence in Coconut Grove. A lively raconteur, he liked to recall his early years  in Florida and deeply lamented the passing of its solitude and  the unspoiled nature that had charmed him into permanent residence.

The Florida Stories of Kirk Monroe					Leonard, Irving A. (Irving Albert), 1896-1996																											asu0660000017	(1947) David Fairchild recalled memorable evenings listening  to Kirk Munroe's reminiscences. "Fairchild," he once said, "I  don't think in my reincarnation, if there is such a thing, that  I want to come back to Florida. They are killing off all the plume  birds. I remember when the spoonbills on the beach in front  of my house made such a racket that it was almost unpleasant.  Now they are all gone; they never come any more." The Florida  that Kirk Munroe loved was gone forever and, though his home  in Coconut Grove was a mecca for admiring celebrities from all  over the United States, and even the world whom he had met  on his travels, he was never reconciled to the loss of that irrecoverable world of the past which he had so happily exploited  in his stories and other writings.  Today the young people of this far more sophisticated age  do not read or even know of Kirk Munroe's books, but in most  of his life time many were rated superior stories for boys. Their  often remarkable fidelity of detail and the adventurous glimpses  of unfamiliar places that they provided fascinated an army of  youthful readers living in a far less mobile society. His adherence  to the contemporary "genteel tradition" of literature, with its  touches of sentimentality and general moral tone, has clearly  "dated" his writings, but he was often able to convey graphic  impressions of incidents and places deriving from personal experience or first hand observation. As the opening pages of The  Painted Desert (1897), one of his best tales, depicting that  Arizona landscape amply testify, he possessed descriptive gifts of  a high order. Indeed, to reread today some of his chapters is  to awaken a certain nostalgia such as Edgar W. Smith, Secretary of the Baker Street Irregulars, that band of admirers of  A. Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, confesses: "We love the  times in which he lived, the half remembered, half forgotten  times of smug Victorian illusion, of gaslight comfort and contentment, of perfect dignity and grace. The world was precariously in balance . . . but those who moved upon the scene were  very sure that all was well ..."  Though Kirk Munroe placed heavy reliance on coincidence  in his stories, and there was little novelty in his plots, and his  style now seems outworn, the fact that many incidents were semi-  •   11 	asu06600000170013001							65322644 Bytes	3853	5648	3810382312	RGB	8	600	asu06600000170013001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1638	1638	1639.jp2	/asu0660/image/1639.jp2

His readers sensed a vibrant  and enthusiastic spirit animating the cold print behind which  was a writer of boyish zest. Possibly the finest and most perceptive contemporary appraisal of the man and his works comes  from W. A. Rogers, the skilled illustrator of many of his earlier  books. In his autobiography World Worth While Rogers declared: "Writing of Kirk Munroe reminds me that there is no  finer combination than the mind of a man and the heart of a  boy. That combination is what makes the charm of Kirk Munroe's stories for old boys and young boys. Kirk Munroe began  his career as a reporter, and he liked to get his facts at first hand.  He had no trouble in looking at the world from a boy's standpoint, for he had only to look through his own eyes. One who  knew Kirk Munroe only in a city environment knew him not  at all. It was by the camp fire or tramping through mysterious  North woods, or in the illuminating flash of a paddle on a rock-  bound lake that the real Kirk Munroe was revealed." And, it  might be added, he was also best revealed when met in his own  beloved south Florida.  12 	asu06600000170014001							64732636 Bytes	3823	5641	3331081889	RGB	8	600	asu06600000170014001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1639	1639	1640.jp2	/asu0660/image/1640.jp2
The Bankruptcy of Mark Twain					Leary, Lewis (Lewis Gaston), 1906-1990																											asu0660000017	The Bankruptcy of Mark Twain  Lewis Leary  One of the more engaging things about Mark Twain is  that he is very human, and very fallible. "Of course  I'm a fool," he once said. "God made me so. Therefore  if you can't forgive me for my sake, forgive me for God's sake."  He was a humorist—in the limited and in the most extended  meaning of that word. Like all true humorists, he underlined the  inevitability of anguish; but he was also a funny man, whose  slow drawl, studied understatement, and expert timing made  him a popular platform favorite. And he had that sense of  objectivity which is the hallmark of the genuine humorist: his  was not "What fools these mortals be," but "What fools we  mortals be." "I have been," he admitted privately, "an author  for 20 years and an ass for 55."  James M. Cox in Mark Twain: The Fate of Humor describes  him as "the fool of his illusion," and explains how Samuel  Clemens, who at twenty-eight had not done very well, in 1863  invented Mark Twain who could play the fool, could laugh at  and laugh away the failures Samuel Clemens had made, to  become the innocent, at home or abroad, who could tell the  most outrageous whoppers, and get away with it: "I didn't say  that," Samuel Clemens could say, "Mark Twain said it. Don't  blame me." Mark Twain became a mask behind which Samuel  Clemens could hide, and Samuel Clemens, always something  of an entrepreneur, a kind of literary confidence man, supplied  him with all the proper virtues: he was a man's man, gruff and  laconic, who had been places and done things, who spoke the  language of men, but who respected and admired women, and  he was a little henpecked by his wife. Mark Twain—that was a  riverman's term for water which was safe, but only just safe  for navigation, and Mark Twain was only just safe as a guide.  He had great successes, and horrible failures—how marvelous he  is at his best, in "Old Times on the Mississippi," and Huckleberry Finn where, as Hemingway said, all American literature  begins; but how jejune and embarrassing he can be at his worst,  •  13 	asu06600000170015001							65345772 Bytes	3845	5663	1715856944	RGB	8	600	asu06600000170015001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1640	1640	1641.jp2	/asu0660/image/1641.jp2

Sometimes I think  that thinking is the worst thing an artist can do. Consider what  it did to Faulkner or to the poet in Ezra Pound.  Samuel Clemens, like his Colonel Sellers in The Gilded Age,  got to thinking that he should be a rich man. He had just missed  riches in the silver fields of Nevada, the gold fields of California;  he had not made it as a newspaperman in Buffalo; but he had  done so well as a wandering reporter and lecturer and as a  writer of books which were peddled from door to door by  subscription agents that by the time he was into his forties he  had a big house in Hartford, a fine and wealthy wife and three  lovely daughters, a circle of friends which included Beechers  and Stowes, Charles Dudley Warner and Joseph Twichell, and  there he lived what was for him a quiet life, productive and extremely profitable. His best books had been written — but he  didn't know that then. His happiest years were behind him.  For soon this quiet world fell in pieces around him. Restless,  and unsatisfied with what he had, he wanted more. His books  should sell more widely—his publisher, he thought, was robbing  him: "A publisher," he explained, "is by nature so low and vile  that . . . from the bottom of my heart I wish all publishers were  in hell." So he became his own publisher, and went through hell  toward bankruptcy. And for years also he had been supplying  money, sometimes as much as $3,000 a month, toward the  support of an inventor who was going to perfect a typesetting  machine which would make them both rich. But Clemens was  not a business man: nothing worked, except when as Mark  Twain he could be funny, or sometimes write good books.  By the early 1890's he was frantic, and facing financial disaster. He left Hartford and took his family abroad where they  could live less expensively, and he worried and fretted and  swore and beat his brow as he watched financial ruin overtake  him. Then he met Henry H. Rogers of the Standard Oil Company, a financier who steered him through bankruptcy, and then  upward toward riches again. But at a price, for the story of the  friendship between these two takes on Faustian overtones, as  Clemens, in a very real, very human, and very fallible sense  •  14 	asu06600000170016001							65055308 Bytes	3832	5657	1398613367	RGB	8	600	asu06600000170016001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1641	1641	1642.jp2	/asu0660/image/1642.jp2
The Bankruptcy of Mark Twain					Leary, Lewis (Lewis Gaston), 1906-1990																											asu0660000017	1  exchanged moral for financial bankruptcy.  The friendship between Clemens and Henry Rogers began  when Clemens, approaching sixty was bewildered and desperate,  faced with bankruptcy and disgrace. Clemens was a proud man,  and angry, and providentially at just this time he had a cold.  Like many of us he tried one cure after another: first, he tried  to drown it in whiskey, then he tried to starve it to submission;  ] when neither of these worked, he let an osteopath try to pummel  it out of him. But finally he did what he should at first have done  — he went to a throat specialist named Clarence Rice, who was  also Henry Rogers's throat specialist, and Dr. Rice afterwards  said to Mr. Rogers, "Mark Twain is in trouble, and needs help.  Why don't you help him?" And he introduced Mr. Rogers to  Mark Twain, and they got along famously at once. And Clemens  never was the same again.  They were two of a kind, poor boys who had made good, and  they even looked alike. Henry Rogers was of New England background, from Fairhaven in Massachusetts, and he had known  the oil fields of Pennsylvania much as Clemens had known the  silver fields of Nevada, and now, in 1893, was executive vice  president of the Standard Oil Company, known along with John  D. and William Rockefeller, John D. Archbold, and Henry M.  Flagler as one of the more wealthy and most ruthless men of his  time. "Hell-hound Rogers," he was called, a pirate, a butcher.  "No punishable offense," said the New York Times, had ever  been formally proved against him, but his "share in the unfair  and abhorrent methods of Standard Oil was so considerable  that he ought therefore to have suffered increasing torments of  remorse; and undoubtedly he did not so suffer."  Whatever his public image, Rogers was however in private  and in family a kindly man, a good companion, humorous, and  restrained. Among friends, he was a man's man, who played  poker and billiards, liked fast racing yachts and boxing matches  and the theater. He was a gruff, affectionate companion, and  he and Clemens greeted each other with affectionate, unprintable  masculine insults when they met. They hit it off from the first,  swapping tales and insults and schemes for getting Mark Twain  •   15 	asu06600000170017001							65919960 Bytes	3880	5660	3844187217	RGB	8	600	asu06600000170017001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1642	1642	1643.jp2	/asu0660/image/1643.jp2

Clemens envied his new friend, the  way he got things done, the way he manipulated people. He  liked to lounge in Rogers's office at 26 Broadway listening entranced to the manipulations of high finance. He dreamed sometimes that he also might manipulate that way.  But even Rogers's magic touch and helpful money could not  save Clemens. When the publishing company went bankrupt and  the typesetting machine proved finally impracticable, debts  mounted and mounted to over $200,000. Could they be paid?  Rogers thought yes. Clemens wasn't sure. But Mark Twain was  a man of public gestures, and he let it be known that he would  travel around the whole world, old as he was, and ill as he was,  and that he would lecture and lecture until every creditor was  paid in full. "The law recognizes no mortgage on a man's brain,"  he told them, "but I am not a business man, and honor is a  harder master than the law."  Meanwhile, Rogers handled Clemens's business affairs, alternately fighting off and paying off creditors, investing for him in  copper and railroads and oil, so that by 1900, when the Clemens  family returned to the United States, their debts were done away  with, and they were back again where Clemens always wanted  to be, on the road toward wealth. But by that time he was ill  and old, and bitter. While they had been away in Europe his  oldest daughter had died; and he learned that his youngest  daughter was incurably ill; and he saw that Mrs. Clemens was  old and weak and ill, and that made him more bitter still. "I  cannot think," he wrote, "why God, in a moment of idle and  unintelligent folly, invented this bastard human race. And why,  after inventing it, he chose to make each individual in it a nest  of disgusting and unnecessary diseases, a tub of rotten offal."  The whole tenor and temper of Clemens's life now changed.  Of his devotion to Mrs. Clemens there can be no doubt; but she  was ill and his presence tired her, so that he was allowed to  see her only a few minutes every day. But he spoke often of  her in public—in the after-dinner speeches and lectures which  he was increasingly called on to give; his friends and his audiences admired him for the depth of his admiration for his wife.  •  16 	asu06600000170018001							64949028 Bytes	3823	5661	1565866609	RGB	8	600	asu06600000170018001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1643	1643	1644.jp2	/asu0660/image/1644.jp2
The Bankruptcy of Mark Twain					Leary, Lewis (Lewis Gaston), 1906-1990																											asu0660000017	He was Mark Twain, a public man, and his husbandly devotion  became a public thing. His whole life was public now—he enjoyed being seen with Rogers and William Rockefeller at prizefights; he was proud when Stanford White took him to Jim  Corbett's dressingroom at the New York Athletic Club; he liked  being seen riding down Fifth Avenue in her new automobile  with Henry Rogers's attractive daughter-in-law, Mary. He liked  I especially the trips on Rogers's steam yacht, the Kanawha, and  I the poker and horseplay and good masculine fun that was there  I enjoyed.  Samuel Clemens had always wanted to be a millionaire, and  now he was, vicariously: he lived like one, and he was seen  often in the company of bona fide, class A, genuine products.  One part of him hated it; the other part lapped it greedily up:  he became more and more and more spoiled— a kind of private  jester to the Rogers and the Rockefellers and the Flaglers and  their friends. He called Andrew Carnegie St. Andrew, and  Carnegie called him St. Mark, and each knew that the joke of it  was that neither was saintly at all. Their jokes together were  fun. Because Carnegie was a Scotchman, Mark Twain held him  \ responsible for supplying him with Scotch whiskey; but in private  ' Mark Twain wrote Carnegie down as a bandit, at the same time  that in public he let himself be publicly used. It was good for  these wealthy men to be seen with a person so popularly loved  as Mark Twain. They liked him, and they were all brigands  together, each in his kind; but it was also good for their public  image. He rode with them to public hearings at which their  honesty was impugned; he was seen with them at testimonial  banquets and at sporting events. Surely, no man could be all bad,  if Mark Twain liked him. And he did genuinely like these people, and like being seen with them. Newspapers might know  | Rogers as a "Standard Oil fiend," but Clemens knew him as a  friend, and was proud to be privileged to drop in on him or on  I other members of his family whenever he wished, to be petted  and waited on and spoiled.  But knowing the Rogerses and their friends was not something which Clemens shared with his family.

It may  be that Clemens unconsciously believed that by keeping his  family secluded, away from the kind of public and fawning life  which he led, he was keeping them from contamination. For he  became pulled quite asunder, more bitter than he had ever  been, in scorn of all mankind—that damned human race—and  in conscience-ridden condemnation of himself: "What a man  sees in the human race," he said, "is merely himself in the deep  and private honesty of his own heart. Byron despised the human  race because he despised himself. I feel as Byron did and for  the same reason."  His increasing bitterness distressed Mrs. Clemens, who not  many weeks before she died in 1904 wrote him a note which is  filled with wifely devotion and genuine concern, wishing that he  would show the world the sweet dear, tender side that she knew.  But then she died, and he exploded: "there is nothing. There is  no God and no universe; . . . there is only empty space, and in  it a lost and homeless and wandering and companionless and  indestructible thought. And God, and the Universe, and Time,  and Life, and Death, and Joy and Sorrow and Pain only a  grotesque and brutal dream, evolved from the frantic imagination of that insane thought." And what a thing was man: "Hypocrisy, envy, malice, cruelty, vengefulness, seduction, rape,  robbery, swindling, arson, bigamy, adultery, and the oppression  and humiliation of the poor and helpless in all ways have been  and still are more or less common among both the civilized and  uncivilized peoples of the earth."  This world, he wrote, "is a strange place, an extraordinary  place, and interesting. . . . The people are all insane, the other  animals are all insane. Man is a marvelous curiosity. When he  is at his very best he is a sort of low grade nickle-plated angel;  at his worst he is unspeakable, unimaginable; and first and last  and all the time he is a sarcasm. Yet he blandly and in all sincerity calls himself 'the noblest work of God.' ...

Like Walt Whitman, he compared man to the animals:  "indecency, vulgarity, obscenity — these are strictly confined  to man; he invented them. Among the higher animals there is  no trace of them. They hide nothing; they are not ashamed.  Man, with his soiled mind, covers himself. . . . Man is the  Animal that Blushes. He is the only one that does it—or has  occasion to. . . . Of all the animals man is the only one that is  cruel. He is the only one who inflicts pain for the pleasure of  doing it. Man is the only animal that deals in that atrocity of  atrocities, War. He is the only one that gathers his brethren  around him and goes forth in cold blood and with calm pulse  to exterminate his kind. . . . Man is the only slave. And he is  the only animal that enslaves. . . . Man is the only Patriot. . . .  Man is the Religious Animal. ... He is the only animal that  has the true religion — several of them. He is the only animal  that loves his neighbor as himself and cuts his throat if his  theology isn't straight."  "Onward, Christian soldiers  Marching unto war,  With the flag of progress  Going on before. . . .  "On, ye true believers  Put them into flight  Charity dispensing  Mixed with dynamite."  Clemens was bitter and discouraged; he began detailing his  bitterness for posterity, in writings which would not be read for  a hundred years, for he dared not speak these thoughts in his  own day, to his friends who were as sinful as he. The world was  greatly with him, and it pulled him apart. The face he showed  was a clown's face, a serious and sharp-tongued clown, but one  not to be held responsible for what he said.

It is in the letters—  those to his friend William Dean Howells and those which we  have discovered to his friend Henry Rogers—that he is more  fully revealed.  Pulled this way and that, saying sometimes what he must say  and sometimes what he thinks he must, torn asunder by conflicting loyalties, knowing that the comfortable bland thing was  the wrong thing but that it was easier and better applauded, he  shows himself a man fitted to our season, discontented, unsure,  emasculate, shouting curses to drown out the murmurings of  conscience, weak, vacillating, well-meaning, unsure—our brother, Mark Twain, who speaks for us because he is human and  fallible. Perhaps one trouble is that in his bitterness he does  speak for us, but only what we might say, not going beyond  that to something we had not thought to say. And that which  he nor we do not say defines the artist.  20 	asu06600000170022001							65868080 Bytes	3891	5641	2309576921	RGB	8	600	asu06600000170022001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1647	1647	1648.jp2	/asu0660/image/1648.jp2
The American Tradition in Poetry					Ward, Robert S.																											asu0660000017	The American Tradition in Poetry  Robert S. Ward  THE American tradition in poetry is the expression of  American values within the frame of reference of the  American cultural pattern. And in order not to be  misunderstood I should like first of all to explain that what I  mean by culture is the pattern of attitudes toward life shared by  all intelligent members of a group as basic assumptions needing  no exegesis when communicating with those who share the same  heritage. In our case the colonists brought with them from  Europe a set of attitudes toward life, some destined to die a  rapid death on the American frontier, but others fated to persist,  develop, find new rationales, and become a part of the new culture. An instance of a European attitude that could not long  survive was that English custom that each person bear signs of  his social status on his back; in old Jamestown as in old Boston  the gentleman and his lady might wear lace, silver and gold  thread, slashed sleeves, embroidered caps, bands and rayles, gold  and silver girdles, hat bands, belts, and ruffs, but not so the good-  man and his goodie, although themselves permitted finery denied  the day laborer or the servant. Such a rigidly stratified social  order could not long endure against "village democracy" in  communities where bond servants, after working off their indentures, took plots of land, became leaders in the community,  even married daughters of their former masters.  But one of the European attitudes that did persist was the  Puritan's regard for labor, his insistence that salvation depends  immediately upon diligent pursuit of whatever activity God calls  one to. Born of early Protestantism's hatred of the mendicant  friars, contempt for the idler was shared by the Huguenot in  Charleston, the Scotch Irish in Virginia and Pennsylvania, the  Dutch Reformed along the Hudson, and the Puritans from the  West Indies and Maryland all the way to Maine. With more  work to be done in clearing the wilderness than hands to do it,  it is no wonder that this attitude—originally theological and  foreign to European leisure classes—should obtain a new eco-  • 21 	asu06600000170023001							65091744 Bytes	3824	5672	2765091618	RGB	8	600	asu06600000170023001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1648	1648	1649.jp2	/asu0660/image/1649.jp2
The American Tradition in Poetry					Ward, Robert S.																											asu0660000017	nomic rationale and flourish in the growing working class culture of America. Because of it, American poets have always  been singing "Hymns to Labor" whether entitled "The Village  Blacksmith," "A Song for Occupations," "I am the People, the  Mob," or "The Death of the Hired Man." As Mr. Robert Frost  put it in "New Hampshire":  I met a lady from the South who said  (You won't believe she said it, but she said it):  "None of my family ever worked, or had a thing to sell."  Another of our cultural attitudes that we owe to the theological  attitudes of our colonial forebears, more particularly to the  Congregational Puritans of New England is our faith in free  public education, a faith taken so much for granted that even our  more tax conscious political figures find it convenient to recommend legislation purporting to further education, however ineffectual it may be. The Puritan settlers brought with them Wy-  cliff's doctrine of the priesthood of all true believers, of which  Vernon L. Partington wrote (assigning it to Luther) that there  was gunpowder packed away in it; there was also Harvard College packed away in it, and thousands of little red schoolhouses  as well, for in order to become a believer—the New Englander  thought—one must not only read God's Word, but understand  it; he therefore decreed that each town must have its school, and  the result was that—two centuries later, at the height of the  "War of Letters"—Washington Irving was enabled to twit the  British, in the Sketchbook, with the remark that in America  universal education makes every individual a reader. Our early  poets used to compose poems on education, satires as well as  panegyrics; one thinks immediately of Trumbull's Progress of  Dullness, Dwight's Greenfield Hill, and even Walt Whitman  listening to the Learn'd Astronomer, and still we find our poets  concerned with Education; witness Mr. Frost, himself once a  school teacher, campaigning to elevate teaching in the high  schools and his lines in "The Axe-Helve":  Such doubts of education should depend  Upon the education of those who hold them.  But more significant for this subject is the effect of universal  •  22 	asu06600000170024001							65202076 Bytes	3833	5667	1423695247	RGB	8	600	asu06600000170024001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1649	1649	1650.jp2	/asu0660/image/1650.jp2
The American Tradition in Poetry					Ward, Robert S.																											asu0660000017	education in creating a reading public. No conscientious poet in  a democracy can shrug off the problem—growing more and  more acute as huge masses of students pour out of the high  schools into the colleges—the problem of communicating with  educated Americans without prostituting art to popularity. Poe  faced the problem in his review of Hawthorne's Tales and concluded: "But the simple truth is that the writer who aims at  impressing the people is always wrong when he fails in forcing  that people to receive the impression." Walt Whitman apparently  hoped that he was writing for "a new and greater literatus order,"  and perhaps achieved a measure of success, and certainly Archibald MacLeish has succeeded to a degree with his verse plays  for radio, but it seems to me that it is again Mr. Frost who,  more than any other—certainly more than Mr. E. A. Robinson  —has succeeded in communicating with more Americans than  any other poet of our day without betraying his art. "The Masque  of Reason" is—of course—not for all, but most of us can read  "Blueberries."  The priesthood of believers doctrine has had another corollary  central to our culture: I refer to our anti-authoritarianism. We  may or may not like Harry Truman, but—like Harry—we are  all from Missouri and have to be shown. Therefore our poetry,  since it can't pontificate, must be original, must communicate a  new awareness of value, and can never accept Pope's formula:  True wit is nature to advantage dressed,  What oft was thought but ne'er so well express'd.  The American poem must tell us the results of its author's inquiry into the quality of our experience. As Emerson put it:  "The poet is the person in whom these powers are in balance, the  man without impediment, who sees and handles that which  others dream of, traverses the whole scale of experience, and is  representative of man, in virtue of being the largest power to  receive and to impart." Certainly no one would call the British  culture authoritarian or its society totalitarian: yet few Americans could accept the stratified social order which Sir J. M.  Barrie portrayed so well in The Admirable Crichton; it may,  indeed, be as satisfactory to be the best butler in England as to  •  23 	asu06600000170025001							64994416 Bytes	3823	5665	374442193	RGB	8	600	asu06600000170025001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1650	1650	1651.jp2	/asu0660/image/1651.jp2
The American Tradition in Poetry					Ward, Robert S.																											asu0660000017	be an Earl, but any American in Crichton's shoes would have  married Lady Mary. The contrast between our two cultures in  this respect is made clear again by comparing Carlyle's Heroes  and Hero Worship with his friend Emerson's parallel work Representative Men, in which the Sage of Concord agrees with Longfellow about the lives of great men; they "remind us we can  make our lives sublime." Even the United States Navy recognizes  that leadership is seldom by fiat: we just resent it when anyone  implies that we don't know how to do our job or that we are so  irresponsible as not to do what we ought. Again Mr. Frost provides a sensitive treatment of this facet of our life in "The Code":  The hand that knows his business won't be told  To do work better or faster—those two things.  Then there is among our cultural attitudes the American acceptance of equality of the sexes as distinct from the traditional medieval ideal of the daughter of Eve, lovely and weak, created by  God to serve man. On the American frontier women had to  assume responsibilities far beyond the capacity of the faithful  Griselda; when her mate was away on expeditions to hunt and  fish for food, entire command of the household was her responsibility; it was up to her to care for the vegetable patch and  supervise the children; if war whoops sounded she had to seize  a gun and put it to good use: and it was she who had to teach  the youngsters their ABC's. Our literary men have always been  sensitive to woman's peculiar status in America. For instance  Longfellow's Priscilla with her very unladylike "Why don't you  speak for yourself, John." Among the novelists, Howells and  Henry James have provided very perceptive contrasts of the  American equality of the sexes with European attitudes. In the  Lady of the Aroostoock Howells depicts a beautiful young American girl, by accident the only female on a packet out of Boston  bound for Trieste; her complete lack of awareness of anything  compromising to her in the situation contrasts strikingly with the  frenzied antics of the three young Europeanized Bostonians, her  fellow passengers, trying desperately to cover up their embarass-  ment; the New England country school-teacher is shocked and  incredulous when informed by her aunt of the light in which her  •  24 	asu06600000170026001							65216152 Bytes	3859	5630	2055715624	RGB	8	600	asu06600000170026001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1651	1651	1652.jp2	/asu0660/image/1652.jp2
The American Tradition in Poetry					Ward, Robert S.																											asu0660000017	voyage appears to Italian society with its assumption that no  unmarried female left without duenna in the society of a male  could possibly retain her virtue. Henry James, too, found the  European attitude degrading, and—although Daisy Miller falls  a victim to it, Isabel Archer rides out superbly every storm. And  in Mr. Frost's poems the American attitude manifests itself in a  fine feeling for the partnership of man and woman even when  the woman has broken under the intolerable load of a rocky  New Hampshire farm, or when the partnership is not what it  ought to be, as in "Home Burial" or "The Oft Repeated Dream";  a fine expression of the real thing is in "West Running Brook":  As you and I are married to each other,  We'll both be married to the brook. We'll build  Our bridge across it, and the bridge shall be  Our arm thrown over it asleep beside it.  Still another American attitude is our suspicion of verbalism  and high sounding language. American poets welcomed Wordsworth's dictim about poetry and the language of everyday  speech. Longfellow's "Psalm of Life" is an early example of the  American poet's fondness for simple, short Old English derivatives; so too is Bryant's "Some of us call it Autumn but others  call it God." And our contemporaries provide endless examples,  as Conrad Aiken's: "While the blue noon above us arches,"  MacLeish's "And here upon earth's noonward height To feel the  always coming on, The always rising of the night." Sandburg  gives us: "The fog comes on little cat feet. It sits looking over  harbor and city on silent haunches and then moves on." From  Wallace Stevens:  Just as my fingers on these keys  Make music, so the self-made sounds  On my spirit make music, too.  Or Kenneth Patchen's  The deer is humble, lovely as God made her  I watch her eyes and think of wonder owned."  and, of course, no one has succeeded better with Wordsworth's  precept than he who wrote:  •  25 	asu06600000170027001							65095272 Bytes	3833	5659	3014355171	RGB	8	600	asu06600000170027001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1652	1652	1653.jp2	/asu0660/image/1653.jp2
The American Tradition in Poetry					Ward, Robert S.																											asu0660000017	I came to turn the grass once after one  Who mowed it in the dew before the sun.  The dew was gone that made his blade so keen  Before I came to view the leveled scene.  I looked for him behind an aisle of trees;  I listened for his whetstone on the breeze.  But he had gone his way, the grass all mown,  And I must be, as he had been,—alone,  Perhaps more universally recognized than any other of our attitudes is the optimism which we manage to maintain. It is as  old as the settlement of the Bay Colony purporting to be a city  on the Hill, a Puritan Utopia where the Reformation was at last  to reach its full realization in churches and towns governed by  God's ordinances in their purity; as Edward Johnson pointed out  in his Wonder Working Providence of Sion's Savior success was  certain. How could the issue be doubtful when there were so  many evidences of divine favor? Had there not been a comet  going from east to west as a sign of God's will that John Win-  throp should lead his company to America? And then God had  prepared a plague to destroy the savages; he had even seen to it  that two English speaking natives should be there to help them  when they arrived. God would keep the covenant he had made  with them. Our first poetess, Anne Bradstreet, made her faith  evident in "A Dialog between Old and New England" personified  as mother and daughter. New England replied to Old England's  reproach that she had deserted her parent in a time of great  need, a time of civil strife, by saying in effect: "It's your own  fault. You did not purge your church of pagan excrescences as  I have done. Get rid of your bishops and unscriptural ceremonies  and you will recover from your ailments. Then I will join forces  with you to free France from popery; we'll march on Rome to  destroy anti-Christ; then, with all Europe behind us we'll drive  the Turk from the Holy Sepulcher so that the Millenium may  begin." And thereby the Puritan poetess gave us a proto-type  for programs such as Woodrow Wilson's drive to make the world  safe for democracy, the Marshal Plan, and President Eisenhower's ill-fated crusade for world peace. Our poets have always  had programs of their own by which they envision America ful-  •  26 	asu06600000170028001							65307204 Bytes	3853	5648	4021967246	RGB	8	600	asu06600000170028001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1653	1653	1654.jp2	/asu0660/image/1654.jp2
The American Tradition in Poetry					Ward, Robert S.																											asu0660000017	filling its manifest destiny. Freneau and Brackenridge had one  which they wrote into their commencement poem, "The Rising  Glory of America"; Barlow wrote his into, first "The Vision of  Columbus," then "The Columbiad"; and Bryant, in his Phi Beta  Kappa Poem, "The Ages," spoke thus optimistically:  The spirit of that day is still awake,  And spreads himself, and shall not sleep again;  But through the idle mesh of power shall break,  Like billows o'er the Asian monarch's chain;  Till men are filled with him and feel how vain,  Instead of the pure heart and innocent hands.  Are all the pompous modes to gain proud and  The smile of heaven;—till a new age expands  Its white and holy wings above the peaceful lands.  Wall Whitman's ebullient spirit phrased it, "Today, ahead  though dimly, we see in vistas, a copious, sane, gigantic offspring.  For our New World I consider far less important for what it has  done, or what it is, than for results to come." Now of course we  have had our disillusionments; and many of our poets have been  disillusioned young men, particularly during the period from the  Treaty of Versailles through the Hoover depression, but most of  our poets, like Longfellow, have a faith triumphant o'er their  fears. So Archibald MacLeish, in "The Fall of the City," implies  that America can fall only if it should lose faith, thus endorsing  Franklin Roosevelt's rallying cry, "The only thing we have to  fear is fear itself." Conrad Aiken writes:  Let us blow silver horns in the twilight,  And lift our hearts to the yellow star in the green  To find perhaps, if, while the dew is rising,  Clear things may not be seen.  Carl Sandburg, in "The People Live On," ends with the stanza:  In the darkness with a great bundle of grief  the people march  In the night, and overhead a shovel of stars for keeps,  the people march:  Where to? What next?  •  27 	asu06600000170029001							65881228 Bytes	3875	5664	3941656785	RGB	8	600	asu06600000170029001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1654	1654	1655.jp2	/asu0660/image/1655.jp2
The American Tradition in Poetry					Ward, Robert S.																											asu0660000017	And a fine expression of it is Mr. Frost's "Riders"  The surest thing there is is we are riders,  And though none too successful at it, guiders,  Through everything presented, land and tide  And now the very air, of what we ride.  What is this talked-of mystery of birth  But being mounted bareback on the earth?  We can just see the infant up astride  His small fist buried in the bushy hide.  There is our wildest mount—a headless horse.  But though it runs unbridled off its course,  And all our blandishments would seem defied,  We have ideas yet that we haven't tried.  This optimism may be, as our foreign critics and our own  sophisticates assert, naive, but we still go on with our pragmatic  faith trying one thing and, if that doesn't work, trying something  else. Our optimism, born in theological chiliasm, found a new  frame of reference in political liberalism, developed into economic faith in the availability of the good life, and has now  turned to scientific laboratories which somehow are to bring  progress into the space age.  I think no one questions the basic optimism of American culture, but somehow we like to talk about ourselves as Individualists as we go on joining all the clubs that will let us in and start  moping at the very prospect of lost belongingness. This corpor-  ateness, to give it the name Emerson used for it, is as little recognized by us as by our foreign critics and is another attitude  which our New England Puritan forebears brought with them  as they settled closely huddled together in towns and covenanted  with each other to form bodies politic and to join together in  churches. Their covenant theology with its insistence that they  must follow God's law as a group or suffer punishment as a  group gave them a feeling of belongingness along with a pesky  tendency to stick their noses into their neighbors' affairs. John  Winthrop early explained to them the distinction between natural liberty and civil liberty, the former being the Individualist's  beloved freedom to do as he pleases, the other, democratic li-  •  28 	asu06600000170030001							64795220 Bytes	3835	5630	1672112046	RGB	8	600	asu06600000170030001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1655	1655	1656.jp2	/asu0660/image/1656.jp2
The American Tradition in Poetry					Ward, Robert S.																											asu0660000017	berty and responsibility to do what one ought. Conditions of life  in the wilderness with too few hands to do the work that needed  doing reenforced the Congregational concept of a church as a  group of humans thinking and feeling together as opposed to  the geographic concept of the parish; for on the frontier, people  had to work together, and so emerged our rural group way of  rebuilding barns that have burned down, fighting forest fires,  and bringing in the harvest. Not a collectivist, authoritarian  structure with a hierarchy of minor and major potentates shouting orders, just a group of good neighbors getting together to  put the thing across. It explains why we play baseball instead  of cricket and football rather than Rugby. It was, of course, Walt  Whitman who made it the theme of his great democratic epic  with: "One's Self I Sing, a simple separate person, yet utter the  word Democratic, the word En Masse," thereby giving a new application to Emerson's fable in his Phi Beta Kappa oration "The  American Scholar," of God dividing man into men as the hand  developed fingers, the better to answer to its end. In our tradition no one ever dreamed of questioning that virtue consisted  in unselfish devotion to the welfare of the group until Billy  Sumner at Yale popularized a set of British inventions, such as  the iron law of wages and intelligent self interest being one with  group interest. Bryant gave early expression to this corporateness  as overcoming the traditional Individualistic fear of death in  "Thanatopsis," a vein which Whitman was to mine again in  "When Lilacs last in the Dooryard Bloomed," and Carl Sandburg in "Grass." Mr. Frost made his eloquent plea for corporateness with "Something there is that doesn't like a wall," and  the picture of his neighbor "like an old stone savage armed"  mouthing in darkness, "Good fences make good neighbors."  And finally there is the philosophic basis for these American  attitudes, sometimes called "practical idealism," sometimes just  "pragmatism". This philosophy began to grow here very early  out of a contempt for all theoretical formulations that had no  practical application to fife on this earth. Early in the Eighteenth  Century Cotton Mather, in his Manuductio ad Ministerium, an  open letter to young divinity students, tore into the curriculum  of the medieval university with a vengeance: rhetoric he disposed  • 29 	asu06600000170031001							65359392 Bytes	3837	5676	875736246	RGB	8	600	asu06600000170031001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1656	1656	1657.jp2	/asu0660/image/1657.jp2
The American Tradition in Poetry					Ward, Robert S.																											asu0660000017	of with contempt urging the reading of the New Testament as a  substitute; as for logic, he called it "vulgar syllogizing," an insult to man, who is by nature reasonable; the languages, he said,  should not be studied for themselves, but as instruments to the  sciences; and as for metaphysics, "Don't bother your head with  such cob-webs," he wrote, "if you must have a philosophy, take  the experimental philosophy of Lord Verulam." In his hands  the Puritan faith turned away from concern with saving immortal  souls toward the focus he gave it in his Essays to Do Good, to  the inspiration of which Benjamin Franklin, in his old age, attributed all that he had done for America. Pragmatism has always given meaning to abstractions only in the life facts to  which they refer. Its basis—it seems to me—is the logic used in  formulating attitudes about life. Traditionally men have assigned  reality either to the idea of the thing or to the thing itself. There  has been the old debate between nominalist and realist, but here  in America there has been a reluctance to join either side. Our  Congregational ancestors early became so entangled in their  distinction between the idealistic dream of the church Invisible  and the Church visible that they had to invent the half-way  covenant to let the town into the church. Gradually the habit  grew of looking for reality in the whole process of human inter-  penetration with the environment, a swinging relationship between lofty ideals and the life facts that give them realization.  Maintaining such a balance is the life of democracy; subjective  idealism inevitably subordinates the lives of the people to some  abstract formulation as a goal, thus bringing on fascism, and  materialism must culminate in atomistic Individualism, an anarchy of "I can do as I pleaseism" sometimes called "rugged  individualism." Democratic transactionalism has been given one  of its finest expressions by Mr. Frost in his poem "Birches" as  the boy swings up toward the rarefied atmosphere "toward  heaven" but always comes down to plant his feet firmly on the  ground. Indeed, "One could do worse than be a swinger of  birches."  30 	asu06600000170032001							64894264 Bytes	3832	5643	185387937	RGB	8	600	asu06600000170032001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1657	1657	1658.jp2	/asu0660/image/1658.jp2

Blake, Hogarth, and the Engraver's Art of Line					Gilpin, George H.																											asu0660000029	THE  CARRELL  Volume 17 1976  Blake, Hogarth, and the Engraver's Art of Line  GEORGE H. GILPIN  Contemplating the drawings of prehistoric man on the  walls of caves, the contemporary engraver, Stanley  William Hayter, speculates that lines have a "magical  power . . . over space and experience."1 Hayter defines engraving as "the art of line,,, a means, as he says, "to exploit the  enormous possibilities of indicating the properties of matter,  force, motion, and space."2 With his interest in line as line,  Hayter continues the tradition of serious engravers, those who  see their work as more than a means of producing inexpensive  copies, who defend their particular way of reaching for  reality that is in inevitable conflict with the values of their  fashionable rival, painting. The painter is interested in qualities attendant to the surface of things, such as color, chiaroscuro, mass; the engraver seeks to discover linear form or the  outline of things. There is in the engraver's style, as Heinrich  Wolfflin describes it, "still an element of physical grasping.  The operation which the eye performs resembles the operation  of the hand which feels along the body."3 In the act of  draughtsmanship, then, line acquires the value of being the  way "in" to the perception of a reality beneath the appearance  of things. Line is, says Hayter, developing a thought of Paul  Klee, "the path . . . prepared by the 'creation/ by the activity  of the imagination."4  Perhaps because of the nature of the task, cutting a  groove into a resistant surface, the engraver's style has traditionally been defended aesthetically with the Platonic notion 	asu06600000290003001							67018112 Bytes	3904	5720	1754405097	RGB	8	600	asu06600000290003001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1665	1665	1666.jp2	/asu0660/image/1666.jp2
Blake, Hogarth, and the Engraver's Art of Line					Gilpin, George H.																											asu0660000029	that true form can only be found beneath the imperfect and  transitory surface of phenomena. Certainly this assumption  shapes the best essay on linear style in the eighteenth century,  The Analysis of Beauty by William Hogarth (1758). The  work is Hogarth's justification of his compositions, both  engraved and painted, to the critics and collectors who  preferred the painterly qualities of continental old masters.  Therefore, the treatise is a manual of style that, though not  a defense of engraving alone, states concepts about the use  and function of line that inspired contemporary engravers  like Hayter and, before him as we shall see, William Blake.  The treatise originated in Hogarth's advocacy of the "Line of  Beauty", which first appeared on the palette held by the  artist in his Self-portrait of 1745, but the treatise is a general  refutation of prevailing neoclassical ideas of regularity and  distinctness in art. Hogarth stresses variety and intricacy,  and his "Line of Beauty" is the primary means of achieving  these aesthetic goals.5  According to Hogarth, there is a particular shape to the  "Line of Beauty" that creates an artistic effect that is  sculptural. Lines should be serpentine, Hogarth argues, and  in good academic fashion he cites authorities for his view,  one being Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo (1538-1600), the Italian  Renaissance painter and scholar, who wrote:  For the greatest grace and life that a picture can have, is,  that it expresses Motion: which the Painters call the spirite  of a picture: Nowe there is no forme so fitte to express this  motion, as that of the flame of fire, which according to  Aristotle and the other Philosophers, is an elemente most  active of all others: because the forme of the flame thereof  is most apt for motion: for it hath a Conus or sharpe pointe  wherewith it seemeth to divide the aire, that so it may ascende  to his proper sphere. So that a picture having this forme will  bee most beautifull."6  The effect of such lines, Hogarth goes on to say, is to  "serve to raise the ideas of bodies in the mind, and which  are undoubtedly to be considered as drawn on the surfaces  only of solid or opake bodies: yet the endeavouring to conceive, as accurate an idea as is possible, of the inside of those  surfaces."7 The artist should consider objects "merely as  shells composed of lines" to "obtain the true and full idea 	asu06600000290004001							66580028 Bytes	3880	5718	2986307252	RGB	8	600	asu06600000290004001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1666	1666	1667.jp2	/asu0660/image/1667.jp2
Blake, Hogarth, and the Engraver's Art of Line					Gilpin, George H.																											asu0660000029	of what is call'd the outlines of a figure."8 Thus, the linear  artist in his Platonic way finds an ideal form beyond the  surface of things because as Hogarth explains in anticipation  of Hayter and Klee, "the imagination will naturally enter into  the vacant space within this shell, and there at once, as from  a center, view the whole form within . . ."9  Hogarth wrote his Analysis of Beauty to defend his art  against a public taste dominated by painterly and neoclassical  assumptions, and his treatise seems to have been particularly  relevant to William Blake on the occasion of the public exhibition of his work in 1809. The "Descriptive Catalogue" prepared for the exhibition and the notes for a "Public Address"  that Blake collected in his notebook after his disastrous  critical reception echo Hogarth on the nature of line. Blake  rejects Hogarth's prescriptive insistence on serpentine lines  alone as the epitome of beauty, declaring "Every Line is the  Line of Beauty" (p. 564),10 but he clearly defends his famous  predecessor's appreciation of line. Referring to Thomas  Cooke's effort to reengrave Horgarth's plates in order to  keep them popular, an effort that technically reflected the  practice of making prints look as much as possible like paintings, Blake writes: "I also knew something of Tom Cooke  who Engraved after Hogarth. Cooke wished to give to  Hogarth what he could take from Rafael that is Outline &  Mass & Colour . . ." (p. 563). In a satiric verse, Blake is  more succinct:  Tom Cooke cut Hogarth down with his clean graving.  Thousands of Connoisseurs with joy ran raving (p. 496)  Blake defends his own style against the opinion derived  from painting, "that Drawing spoils an Engraver," which  influenced the work of contemporaries like Francesco Bar-  tolozzi (Blake spells it "Bartolouzzi"), William Woollett, and  Robert Strange. They sacrificed line in an attempt to copy  the surface effects of painting, and their efforts, Blake  thought, lacked merit: "Engraving by Losing drawing has  Lost all Character & all Expression without which [The]  Art is Lost" (p. 561). The copyist's desire to imitate the  appearance of the painted surface denies what is for Blake  the value of art, the invention or imagination expressed by  lines. He writes: "Men think they can Copy Nature as Cor-  1 	asu06600000290005001							65808568 Bytes	3833	5721	2717473256	RGB	8	600	asu06600000290005001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1667	1667	1668.jp2	/asu0660/image/1668.jp2

Why are Copiers of Nature  Incorrect while Copiers of Imagination are Correct this is  manifest to all" (p. 563). Blake sees his imitative contemporaries neglecting the importance of line which, in engraving,  is the point of creative contact between the artist and his  medium. Imagination finds expression in the act of linear  execution, and Blake says that a design cannot be made "without minutely Appropriate Execution ... He who copies does  not Execute he only Imitates what is already Executed. Execution is only the result of Invention" (p. 565). Blake's own execution always depends on lines, and in the "Descriptive Catalogue" the nature and value of a linear style is proclaimed:  The great and golden rule of art, as well as of life, is this:  That the more distinct, sharp, and wirey the bounding line,  the more perfect the work of art; and the less keen and sharp,  the greater is the evidence of weak imitation, plagiarism, and  bungling. Great inventors, in all ages, knew this . . . The want  of this determinate and bounding form evidences the want of  idea in the artist's mind, and the pretence of the plagiary in  all its branches. How do we distinguish the oak from the  beech, the horse from the ox, but by the bounding outline?  How do we distinguish one face or countenance from another,  but by the bounding line and its infinite inflexions and movements? . . . Leave out this line and you leave out life itself;  All is chaos again, and the line of the almighty must be drawn  out upon it before man or beast can exist  (p. 540).  Clearly Blake's "bounding line" derives from Hogarth's  "Line of Beauty," and certainly its use creates the visual  values of the Prophetic Books. If we look at a plate from  Milton or Jerusalem on which there are no nameable forms,  we still find cursive lettering and swirling lines of decoration  and, always, the rough, dark margin of the edge of the unen-  graved portion of the plate which remains around the design.  The linear energy of the design seems to be asserting itself  against this unengraved margin, imaginative line in vital  confrontation with dull surface. On plates with more detail,  we find merely decorative lines reinforced by definable shapes  like serpents, or winding roots and branches, or soaring  birds with outstretched wings, and, on some plates, human  • 4 	asu06600000290006001							67086176 Bytes	3883	5757	2346805701	RGB	8	600	asu06600000290006001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1668	1668	1669.jp2	/asu0660/image/1669.jp2

Even when Blake adds  color, it is transparent enough so that the outlines of the design are not obscured; indeed, Blake's characters usually look  naked even when dressed. Hogarth had argued for "the beauty  of a composed intricacy of form, and how it may be said, with  propriety, to lead the eye a kind of chace,ff and the bounding  lines of Blake's engravings, whether representational or  decorative, produce this effect.  Lines are Blake's usual means of expressive gesture, and  they are most bounding and intricate when the poet-etcher is  celebrating life, energy, and the imagination. He expresses  these values with the kind of lines advocated by Lomazzo in  Hogarth's treatise, those which have the active motion of  flames. The flame-flowers of Songs of Innocence and Songs of  Experience, the revolutionary birth of Ore, the creative struggle of Los, the resurrection of man — the designs for these  scenes are dominated by swirling lines of fire. Blake in his  own defense of style, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell,  identifies fire with the techniques of the engraver "printing  in the infernal method, by corrosives, which in Hell are  salutary and medicinal, melting apparent surfaces away, and  displaying the infinite which was hid." Blake's fiery lines  articulate his prophetic effort to cleanse and purge, "for  man," as the artist says, "has closed himself up, till he sees  all things thro' narrow chinks of his cavern." Sharing Hogarth's Platonic aesthetic, Blake seeks to discover the ideal  reality, "the infinite," beneath the surface of things, and he  offers his own version of Plato's "Allegory of the Cave" when  he describes the "Printing-house in Hell." His description  generally presents the steps in the process of engraving from  cleaning the plate to distributing the completed work,12 but  of particular interest here are the details of execution which  the passage lists. Blake's fascination as an engraver with  cleansing surfaces and creating designs is represented by  activity in each chamber of the printing house. A Dragon-Man  and Dragons, a Viper, an Eagle, Lions, "Unnamed" forms —  each works to embellish its particular chamber by "clearing"  and "hollowing," "folding" and "adorning," "raging" and  "melting," and each figure recurs frequently as a motif in  Blake's designs. In this way, the work in each chamber  suggests the execution of a different plate by which the artist  seeks to make his mark, to etch out bounding lines in search  • 6 	asu06600000290008001							67047444 Bytes	3897	5733	3261409863	RGB	8	600	asu06600000290008001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1670	1670	1671.jp2	/asu0660/image/1671.jp2
Blake, Hogarth, and the Engraver's Art of Line					Gilpin, George H.																											asu0660000029	of the "infinite" on the walls of the dark cavern of existence.  A final function of Blake's linear style is to evaluate the  subject matter of his designs. The significance of the color  print, "Newton," depends on the visual irony created by a  contrast between neoclassical and Hogarthian lines.  Newton's way of explaining nature, his geometry in the  sand, is neoclassical artistry: regular, distinct, symmetrical.  Hogarth had argued that such simplicity of line was unnatural, and Blake juxtaposes Newton's design against the  intricate, varied lines of myriad natural shapes on the rock  on which the thinker is sitting. The beauty of these forms  attracts and pleases the eye of the observer, and the fallacy  of Newton's simplistic view of nature is apparent. The  prophetic book, Europe, also confirms Blake's faith in the art  of the bounding line. The title page and frontispiece confront  the reader with contrasting versions of artistic activity. For  the frontispiece, Blake uses the design "Ancient of Days"  which shows the act of Creation as described by Milton in  Paradise Lost (Book VII, 11. 224-228), the Almighty circumscribing the limits of the universe with a pair of golden  compasses. Like Newton, God is a geometer whose art implies  uniformity, regularity, and symmetry, the values rejected  aesthetically by Hogarth and philosophically by Blake. In  contrast is the title-page showing a dragon uncoiling atop  flamelike flowers in a cave whose dark walls surround the  design. The dragon appears energetic and ferocious as he  works to create space for himself and the letters proclaiming  the title of the book. Along the top of the dragon's tail appear  the artist's name and place and date of publication. When we  first look at the two plates, we might prefer the grandeur of  the Almighty's artistry to the lowliness of the dragon's  drudgery, but, suddenly, our eye is caught by the devilish  glee in the serpent's eye. We see, then, that this serpent  writhing in the abyss and giving form and energy to it is the  Dragon-Man in the printing-house in hell, William Blake  celebrating the magical power of the engraver's art of line.  7 • 	asu06600000290009001							66150504 Bytes	3840	5740	2406641684	RGB	8	600	asu06600000290009001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1671	1671	1672.jp2	/asu0660/image/1672.jp2

Robert Frost at Home					Gordon, Marie																											asu0660000029	Robert Frost at Home  MARIE (MRS. DONALD) GORDON  MY husband and I lived in the Robert Frost cottages  in South Miami, Florida, for several years. We  "kept them warm" for him, he would say, when he  came down for six weeks in winter. When we built our own  home on the south end of his five acres we kept an eye on his  place and on him when he stayed there. In 1951 we spent a  month in a house Robert owned, the Euber house, near  Robert's summer home at Ripton, Vermont. The following  year we bought the Euber place, and every summer for the  next ten years we took our three grandchildren, Carol, Elinor  and Robert Frost II to to spend the summer near their greatgrandfather. At parties Robert enjoyed introducing me as  Robert Frost's grandmother, which, of course, I was.  Whether in Vermont or in Florida, Robert came to dinner  at least once a week. Corn muffins were a must — he loved  them! Fresh bibb lettuce leaves, left whole for salad, baked  potatoes, a steak, pan-broiled, and ice-cream for dessert made  up his favorite meal. He could never understand why Vermont  ice-cream wasn't as good as the kind we served him in Miami.  It was fun to have him for a guest.  He was happy to have his great-grandchildren living just  a long mile through the woods from his house. He and they  entertained each other while they waited for dinner. The?/  discussed the need for a corral for Pedro, the donkey he had  given them. After it was built, they would lean on the rails  and talk about many things. Robert taught them to feed Pedro  the tender tips of maple branches which the donkey loved.  Somewhere in my files is a picture of the four of them feeding  the donkey.  After dinner, he would talk with the children about all  sorts of things. Once he spent an hour showing them how to  make cat's cradles with string. He was gentle and patient;  they were inept but determined.  9 • 	asu06600000290011001							66333844 Bytes	3867	5716	3045010556	RGB	8	600	asu06600000290011001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1673	1673	1674.jp2	/asu0660/image/1674.jp2

Robert Frost at Home					Gordon, Marie																											asu0660000029	Sometimes he'd listen to them read. Once, Bobby, who was  about four, was reading Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat.  Robert's expression was unbelieving amazement! He knew  the author but had never heard one of his stories. He wasn't  at all sure that such nonsense was in the best interest of his  great-grandson.  One night he was reading to the children after they were  in bed upstairs. Adults not allowed, I was unashamedly eavesdropping on the stairs. When he read his poem, "The Last  Word of a Bluebird" he added a line, "and bring in the wood."  He told the children that that line wasn't in the book but that  it should be, because he wrote it that way.  The children safely in bed, we would talk for hours. Sometimes he would start the long walk home through the deep  dark woods after midnight. He refused to be driven home  because he loved the walk, and off he would go with only his  flashlight to guide him. We worried about him; there wasn't  a phone in either house for checking-up.  How Robert loved Vermont! What an honor to be invited  to go for a walk with him there! We walked around the  perimeter of his property and ours. The two were joined at  the upper edge north of the government wood. Once he found  a bottled gentian and gave it to me. It is under the glass on  my desk — dry and faded.  Another time he taught me how to tell the difference  between the leaves of the sugar and the weed maple. He said  that native children knew the difference, but he doubted that  they could explain it — they were just born knowing.  Listening was one of Robert Frost's great talents. Conversation with him was an exciting and challenging experience.  He often listened more than he talked, and this made one  fear to be trivial or inane. Once when we were on a rather  long drive, I mentioned my involvement, as a teacher, in  play therapy. He was immediately intrigued and began to  ask questions. What kind of problems lead to the use of the  therapy? Where were the sessions held? How often? How  long? Were notes made during the session? What did the  child say about that? Did such therapy really change behavior?  The questions lead to a report on one or two special cases.  The great man listened with sincere interest and made comments to encourage further details.

For Robert, conversation was a viable two-sided activity  — talking and listening. He was a superb master at both.  Marie and Donald Gordon are the parents of Phyllis Marie, who is the  wife of William Prescott Frost, III, grandson of Robert Frost. The  Gordons and Robert Frost were good friends and good neighbors in both  Ripton, Vermont and South Miami, Florida.  i  Robert Frost at the University of Miami  GEORGE W. ROSNER  Robert Frost was no stranger to South Florida. In  December of 1934 he and Mrs. Frost arrived in Miami  » in precarious health and fearing a repetition of the  previous winter's severe bout with pulmonary ailments. By  Christmas they were residing in Key West. The sojourn  lasted until April 1935. In March of that year he gave the  concluding lecture of the fourth annual series of the University of Miami's Winter Institute of Literature.  Another lecturer in the same series was the author Hervey  Allen, and an enduring friendship developed between the two  men. Allen, after the success of his gigantic novel Anthony  Adverse, and the subsequent lucrative moving-picture rights,  bought a large undeveloped tract of land in South Miami.  He built a main house, "The Glades," for himself and his  family and a group of smaller cottages for guests. Frost was /|  a guest in February 1939.  The Allen life-style, the climate, the widening of acquaintances and the deepening of friendships, all these factors  probably appealed to Frost in his search for a retreat from  commitments and from the rigors of a northern winter. In  March 1940 he wrote to Allen, authorizing him to make overtures for the purchase of five acres near "The Glades."

Robert Frost at the University of Miami					Rosner, George W.																											asu0660000029	months later, again in a letter to Allen, Frost proclaimed  himself "a cross between a Vermont farmer and a Florida  farmer," adding that a check was enclosed as a binder and  thanking Allen and his wife Ann "for choosing the plot."  Shortly thereafter he had shipped from the manufacturers  in Massachusetts, two prefabricated New England-style clapboard cottages. In subsequent winters until a year before his  death he retreated to these cottages on Davis Road in South  Miami for rest and relaxation after his strenuous reading  \ and lecturing tours. The stays were short, usually only from  II the end of January to the first or middle of March. In later  ■If years it pleased him to call the place "Pencil Pines."  Robert Frost's continuing friendship with Hervey Allen  undoubtedly led to his forming closer ties with the University  of Miami, for Allen was a staunch supporter of the fledgling  school. The University gave Allen an honorary doctorate in  1933, and as a trustee he helped guide its destiny through critical years, from 1938 to his death in 1949. As well as being a  frequent lecturer at the Winter Institute of Literature Allen  served on the Institute's advisory committee from 1943 to  1946.  I Frost's first appearance at the Winter Institute was well  received by the students and by the community. His own  reaction to the University was later expressed in a letter to his  daughter, Lesley. He pitied both Dr. Orton Lowe, the director  of the Winter Institute, and Dr. Bowman Ashe, the University's president. By contrast with the "real" universities he  knew up north the University was "wretched."  Nevertheless he returned to the Institute the following  year, 1936, this time as the main speaker for five lectures  during the week of January 30. His fellow lecturers were  Padraic and Mary Colum, Bernard de Voto, Dhan Gopal  Mukerji and Hervey Allen. He next appeared at the Institute  on March 13, 1944, and his final appearance took place Febru-  si ary 8, 1945. Both times he gave only readings of his poems  "with comments."  fj Frost's residency in  South Miami brought friends and  relations as visitors and sometimes as residents during the  months he was not there. The cottages served as a home for  Robert's grandson, William Prescott Frost, during the years  that Prescott was a student at the University where he  received a B.S. in Engineering Science in 1947.

Another grandchild, Lesley Lee Francis, whose mother  is Lesley Frost Ballantine, received her M.A. degree from  the University of Miami in 1959.  Recognition of Robert Frost by the University continued  over the years. In 1961, at the January commencement, he  was awarded the University's highest tribute, an honorary  Doctor of Letters. But perhaps the happiest display of mutual  respect and admiration occurred at the celebration of his 75th  birthday. On Sunday evening, February 19, 1950 (the date  agreed upon because he would not be in residence on March  26) a joint effort of the University's departments of Drama,  Speech, Radio, English and Journalism sponsored a dramatization of Frost's A Masque of Reason in the Box Theatre of  the old Anastasia building, with "a reception afterwards in  the patio." By way of acknowledgment and appreciation Frost  read some of his poems and gave autographed copies of his  collected works to the members of the cast. In turn, Frost  was given a pair of high-powered binoculars in recognition  of his interest in bird watching. Florida's poet laureate,  Vivian Larimore Rader, dedicated a poem especially for the  occasion.  As a point of historical significance it is interesting to  note that the United States Senate also marked this birthday,  though in a somewhat more pompous manner, with a string  of "Whereas" resolutions (S.Res.244). Frost's reaction to  this, in a memo to his friend Louis Untermeyer, was a cryptic  "My only comment is the senatorial 'No comment.' "  Frost's next local University-connected appearance was on  March 3, 1959, when he spoke at Plymouth Church in Coconut  Grove before an audience limited by space to six hundred.  Sponsored by the Beaux Arts of the University's Joe and  Emily Lowe Art Gallery, the occasion was a feature of their  Art and Religious Festival.  On February 24, 1960 Frost accepted an invitation initiated and paid for by the undergraduate students. An overflow  crowd of several hundred young people jammed the lounge  of a campus dormitory. After reading some of his poems he  met with a group of ardent admirers in an adjoining garden  for a "bull session." A reporter stated, "It was one of those  • 14 	asu06600000290016001							67042636 Bytes	3883	5753	1278028948	RGB	8	600	asu06600000290016001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1678	1678	1679.jp2	/asu0660/image/1679.jp2

Two days later, his final appearance on campus, he was  the guest speaker at the Spicer-Simson lecture series of the  Friends of the University of Miami Library. In a way the  Friends of the Library, organized in 1959, had filled the  gap left by the Winter Institute of Literature which was  concluded in 1947. The Institute's final speakers, in a program  called "Poetry Today," had included Frost's friends Paul  Engle and Edward Davison. The Friends' first program in  February 1960 had Padraic Colum, Edward Davison, Alistair  Cooke and Robert Frost.  On Sunday, March 24, 1968, five years after his death and  two days before his birthday, the Dade County Federation of  Women's Clubs dedicated an enduring memorial to Robert  Frost. Atop a gentle rise below the entrance to Beaumont  Lecture Hall, where he made his final University appearance  and where thousands of students pass daily, stands a six-foot  rose granite stone inscribed simply, ROBERT FROST.  George W. Rosner is Archives librarian at the University of Miami. He  was Robert Frost's next-door neighbor in South Miami, Florida for the  last nine years of Frost's life.  Robert Frost at 75  FREDERICK H. KOCH, JR.  I met Robert Frost at a cocktail party at Hervey Allen's.  There were lots of people. Hervey loved people and had,  I'm sure, invited everybody he'd run into for the past ten  days. But the architecturally incredible Allen sprawl of houses  would have easily held all of Miami in those early years.

I did find, much to my surprise, that he had written  two one-act plays, which he told me had never been produced.  (Apparently not so, I later discovered; though they had probably not been produced to his satisfaction.) So I suggested  that we do one to celebrate his 75th birthday, which was  coming up in a few weeks.  He was delighted.  The play was immediately put into rehearsal.  University of Miami funds being scarce, I got somebody  to give $200 for food for a party in the patio of the old North  Campus building. Somebody else gave $90 for a fine pair of  binoculars to enhance his birdwatching. And Vivian Laramore  Rader, poet laureate of Florida, wrote a beautiful poem that  we had made huge by photography and mounted in the lobby  of the Box Theatre.  The evening was unforgettably felicitous.  Robert Frost had been one of the stars of the Winter  Institute of Literature in its early days. And then somehow  he had been forgotten. His annual appearances at the greatest  universities in the country could never erase the fact that  he was forgotten here in Miami. Still to come was his deep  honor as poet at the inauguration of John F. Kennedy, but  at the time his ego was badly hurt by the University of  Miami's neglect. At any rate this happy celebration of his  75th birthday poured balm on the wound.  His play A Masque of Reason was excellently done, though  admittedly not in a class with "Stopping by woods on a snowy  evening."  He read from his poetry, and I have never heard poetry  read this way. He was deeply moved by the occasion and the  audience in the packed Box Theatre was too. It was a  memorable and rare evening.  He personally presented autographed copies of his collected  works to each cast member and to the cast of Moss Hart's  Light Up the Sky, the production then at the University  theatre. (He loved that show, done in the full round. Asked  me to take him three times! He enjoyed talking with the cast.  Certainly he was no intellectual snob.)  The $200 party in the patio after the play was an incredible performance. I stood by to introduce people, and he talked  in such a friendly manner to each person, as if each was a  beloved  old  acquaintance.   I  don't think  he  ever  repeated  • 16 	asu06600000290018001							66304980 Bytes	3868	5712	2432155080	RGB	8	600	asu06600000290018001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1680	1680	1681.jp2	/asu0660/image/1681.jp2

I think they all came up to  speak with him. It was late when the celebration ended, and  he, 75 years old and much too fat by modern medical measure,  was still fresh.  I was exhausted, but very, very happy.  It was a Homecoming long overdue.  Then Robert Frost said: "When can you and I have a  good talk? Just you and me. We've always been with so many  people. Just you and me."  It sounds fatuous, but I was very manic at that time. I  had many projects going and was only free after midnight.  "Great. I'm an old man. Sleep little. Come on down after  your show."  So I did. He set a small decanter of port wine on the table.  He drank almost nothing. I like to drink, but in the four-hour  dialogue I forgot it was there. The talk was intoxication  enough.  We talked of everything. It's ironic that he, a staunch  Republican, was to be invited by a liberal Democrat to write  a poem and deliver it at that liberal Democrat's presidential  inauguration; the first American poet to be so honored.  His son's suicide, deepest of the many tragedies that beset  his life, came up.  I said: "I guess everybody has thought seriously of taking  his life at one time or other." I had. Many times.  He said: "No. I never once did. And I've had my share of  trouble."  I said: "Well, that really blows hell out of my life-held  theory — and particularly a sensitive artist like yourself.  How come?"  Frost: (patting his generous paunch) "I guess I just liked  to eat too much. Might miss out on a meal . . . No. I never  once thought of taking my own life."  We talked and talked and all of a sudden it was 4 a.m.  We went outside and dug up a little star jasmine vine that  I had admired.  "It'll grow all right, but watch it or it'll take the place."  It has, blessedly screening out noise, pollution, too much  sun, nearby houses — and frequently reminding me of my  happy association with Robert Frost.  17 • 	asu06600000290019001							65589420 Bytes	3837	5696	2646256359	RGB	8	600	asu06600000290019001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1681	1681	1682.jp2	/asu0660/image/1682.jp2

The Mary McDougal and Ivar Axelson Papers					Hoder-Salmon, Marilyn, 1934-																											asu0660000029	The Mary McDougal and Ivar Axelson Papers  MARILYN HODER-SALMON  The Mary McDougal Axelson papers presented to  the University of Miami Library in 1974 by Mrs. Axel-  son's sisters, Jennie MacKay and Violet McDougal,  span an exceptionally wide-ranging career most notable from  1910 through the 1930s, during which time Mary McDougal  achieved acclaim as a suffrage worker, social reformer, political activist, poet, and playwright.  Mary was born in Tennessee in 1891 of parents whose  ancestors were southern settlers with a pioneer history that  included Civil War heroism. This has been documented by  Mary and is a part of the collection. Mary's father took his  young family to the Indian Territory, where he made his  fortune in oil. He became a founder of the state of Oklahoma  and was a law-and-order crusader in the Western pioneer  tradition. Her mother was a leading woman's rights activist,  prominent club leader, and a National Democratic Committee-  woman.  Mary followed in the family public service tradition while  still a student, venturing forth in the untamed oil districts to  speak for temperance and working as legislative lobbyist to  obtain better conditions for young girls who were wards of  the state. As a young adult Mary asserted her independence  by moving to New York City's Greenwich Village, where she  established herself in both literary and radical circles. She  achieved success as an activist and writer, with accomplishments of historical interest that include being one of the  first two women campaigners in a presidential election (Wilson, 1916), and World War I service as a writer and publicist  for the Food Administration under Herbert Hoover. As an  ardent feminist she worked as an organizer and publicist for  the New York State Woman's Suffrage Party in the "decisive  battle" of 1917. Mary also became affiliated with the Women's  Trade Union League, campaigning for reform legislation  during the League's organizational years.  19 • 	asu06600000290021001							66543620 Bytes	3863	5740	3975941385	RGB	8	600	asu06600000290021001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1683	1683	1684.jp2	/asu0660/image/1684.jp2
The Mary McDougal and Ivar Axelson Papers					Hoder-Salmon, Marilyn, 1934-																											asu0660000029	Mary's career as a poet spanned the 1920s, when her work  was being published in the leading periodicals of the time and  was climaxed by the publication of Wandering Fires, a volume  co-authored with her sister Violet. In the 1930s Mary wrote  plays, one of which, "Life Begins," a childbirth drama based  on her own experience as a two-month patient in a maternity  ward, brought Mary her greatest success. As a play, "Life  Begins" enjoyed critical acclaim, then as a Warner Brothers  film in 1932 it became a world-wide triumph. Remade in 1939  under a new title, "A Child Is Born," the work was released  in tandem with the novel written by Mary from her original  script. "A Child Is Born" enjoyed a popular success as a  "woman's novel", eventually being translated into six languages.  In 1919 the McDougal family purchased Florida acreage  and a home in Coral Gables, where they wintered until 1944,  at which time they became year-round residents. They opened  a land sales office in Miami during the "boom" years and  continued their tradition of public service by becoming  leading figures in Miami civic and literary organizations.  Mary and her husband Ivar also moved to Miami, where Ivar  took a position with the University of Miami faculty and Mary  continued to write and study painting.  The McDougal Axelson Collection assembled by George  Rosner, Archives and Special Collection Librarian, includes  over 200 items divided into journals, manuscripts, writing  notebooks, clipping files and miscellaneous documents. Of  special historical value are the diaries, dating from 1907 to  1961, family photograph albums with Victorian examples,  clippings and letters documenting Mary's work with the  1916 Wilson election, with the Women's Trade Union League,  with the New York State Suffrage campaign, and a variety of  memorabilia with connections to noted events and people. The  author section includes Mary's published works, privately  published family histories, original manuscripts of plays and  short stories in the melodramatic genre, and the record of her  published, as well as unpublished poetry. The collection also  includes the files of Mary's husband, economist Ivar Axelson,  primarily documenting the McDougal-Axelson long-term legal  struggle with the United States Department of Interior to  retain oil and mineral rights in family owned land that had  • 20  I 	asu06600000290022001							66009244 Bytes	3840	5728	2914808787	RGB	8	600	asu06600000290022001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1684	1684	1685.jp2	/asu0660/image/1685.jp2

Additional  materials include records of Mary's father, Judge D.A.  McDougal, and sister Violet, a poet.  Above all, the collection documents the career of a superbly  colorful, richly original figure of the early twentieth century.  Mary died in 1973, at the age of 81, having lived the full and  rewarding life that characterized the independent woman  activist of her era.  Marilyn Hoder-Salmon's thesis for a master's degree in American  Studies at the University of Miami is a two-part study of Mary  McDougal Axelson as a social feminist and as a writer. The first part  portrays the cultural and social milieu of the early twentieth-century  reform movements through Mary Axelson's activism for women's suffrage, women's trade unionism and through her political and pacifist  endeavors. The second part is a chronological study of the social history  of her best-known work, Life Begins. It reflects the public attitude  towards maternity through critical and public response to the play, film  and novel during the period 1932-1939.  21 • 	asu06600000290023001							66698196 Bytes	3864	5752	2246073761	RGB	8	600	asu06600000290023001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1685	1685	1686.jp2	/asu0660/image/1686.jp2
The Ivar Axelson Papers																																asu0660000029	The Ivar Axelson Papers  The preceding article indicates two aspects of Mary  McDougal Axelson's many-faceted career: the literary  and the political. To these may be added an astute  business sense. As a young woman she helped with the details  of her father's oil and real estate transactions in Oklahoma.  After her marriage to economist Ivar Axelson in 1923 she  and Ivar followed her father to Florida, joining him in oil  and real estate enterprises that centered chiefly in what is  now a section of the Everglades National Park.  In Thirteenth Child; the Story of D. A. McDougal (c.1966,  privately printed), her biography of her father, Mary Axelson  gives a vivid picture of early south Florida:  In 1917 my father had fallen in love with a huge wild, then  inaccessible tract of land in Monroe County west of Miami,  with its palm "hammocks," pine and mangrove forests, wide  prairies, great cypress swamps, glittering bays and with a  corner dipping into the Gulf of Mexico. Here were new lands  to pioneer — roads to be built, and drainage to be done. This  was called the Chevelier Tract and was 225,000 acres big. Dad  had sure faith that oil lay secretly under these lands . . .  D. A. McDougal acquired 70,000 acres of this huge tract.  The Axelsons eventually owned another 17,000 acres. Most  of these properties were absorbed into the formation of the  national park, but not without bitter and exhausting opposition.  Again Mary Axelson speaks for the family:  As oil prospects became brighter, a black cloud suddenly  appeared on the financial horizon . . . The potential Everglades National Park which had been talked about for twenty  years became a certainty overnight. The Department of the  Interior announced to Congress that they would condemn  two-thirds of the limited tropical tip end of Florida for this  park in Dade and Monroe County.  But this was not the worst. The thing that really slammed  us between the eyes was the announcement by the National  Park Service that (except for slight concessions to the  Florida East Coast Railroad and the State of Florida)   no  • 22  «■*•«*. 	asu06600000290024001							66140024 Bytes	3853	5720	2308128269	RGB	8	600	asu06600000290024001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1686	1686	1687.jp2	/asu0660/image/1687.jp2

McDougal became the Jack the Giant Killer of the  Sapulpa, Oklahoma years. The Axelsons too grabbed their  trusty halberds, jammed on their helmets, seized their bucklers  and sallied forth, breathing all the fire they could manage.  The battle was on. For a while the Axelson-McDougal  cause seemed hopeless. The big showdown came at the final  hearings before the U. S. Senate and House committees in  Washington. At almost the last moment, in what Mary called  "their darkest hour," a champion appeared. After eloquent  and incisive argument and rebuttal, knowledgeable oil wildcatter Senator Robert S. Kerr of Oklahoma helped achieve  a compromise. Owners of land within the park area were permitted by law to retain oil-leasing rights for a specified term  and oil royalty rights until 1985.  The Ivar Axelson papers consist of approximately two  linear feet of correspondence dealing with the land and oil  controversy. There is an extensive file of letters between  Mary and Ivar. Included also are several scrapbooks of newspaper clippings: the years 1922-24 cover the building of the  Tamiami Trail, including the McDougal Loop Road (now  Florida State Road 94) ; 1943-53, the Everglades National  Park proposed expansion and fight for oil rights; 1954, the  Internal Improvement Fund Trustees' reversal of their 1951  pledge regarding state lands within expanded boundaries of  the Park. In addition, there are aerial maps charting the  Chevelier Tract, several drawn especially for the project.

Inside the Great Wall					Palmeri, Frank																											asu0660000036	THE  CARRELL  Volume 24 1986  Inside the Great Wall  by Frank Palmeri  In Chinese, the golden brown wooden buckets that carry nightsoil  for the fields are called honeypots. At the Shanghai airport, they don't  have conveyor belts for luggage; they have an opening covered by rubber flaps about three feet high. When you see your suitcases come flying through the flaps and slide along the floor, you know you've arrived. In photographs, all Chinese clothes seem to be identical, but it's  actually possible after a little while to notice distinctions between all  the white button-down shirts, baggy olive green trousers, and square  navy blue jackets—distinctions based on weight and texture of fabric,  precision of cut, matching of color, and so on. I might have written  about the elegant method of recycling that the Chinese have practiced  for thousands of years, about their inelegant innovations in customer  service, or about the markers of status in a classless society. Instead,  I've chosen to write about something more intangible: the curious attitude of the Chinese toward the foreigners to whom they are said to  be opening up their country.  At first I was flattered, if a bit embarrassed, to be officially called  a "foreign expert" by the Chinese. I soon noticed that tourists are  called "foreign guests," and even that many people liked to shake  hands or have a conversation with their "foreign friend." The  Chinese are extraordinarily sensitive to what differs from themselves,  and the language insistently reminds one that a vistor, a guest, an expert, a friend, are first of all foreigners. Ethnic Chinese who have  emigrated to another country are distinguished from Chinese who  have never left the "central kingdom" (as the Chinese call their own  country), being known officially as "overseas Chinese." The recent  movie A Great Wall catches this intense awareness of difference in  some background conversation: when a Chinese-American family returns to visit the father's sister who never left Peking, wary neighbors  remark, "Who are they? Japanese? Or maybe Filipinos?" Many  Americans also feel that anyone who differs from them is a foreigner,  but they usually base their judgment on an ethnic difference.  1 	asu06600000360003001							67620920 Bytes	3940	5719	2683626699	RGB	8	600	asu06600000360003001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1694	1694	1695.jp2	/asu0660/image/1695.jp2
Inside the Great Wall					Palmeri, Frank																											asu0660000036	My job in China was to teach English and American literature,  although, to tell the truth, I really couldn't say why the Chinese would  want their students to spend time studying such irrelevant or reactionary writers as Defoe, Wordsworth, or Eliot. My best guess is that  studying literature merely serves as a convenient form of advanced  language study, since ninety-five percent of the English teachers in  China teach language, not literature. So I realized that whatever the  ostensible reason I had been hired by the university, the real reason  was not to teach literary studies; it was to explain English grammar  and syntax through literary examples, and, even more importantly, to  serve as a functioning native speaker of English by comparison to  whom, or to which, the students could check their pronunciation and  usage. I must admit I soon grew tired of being accosted wherever I  went by nervous, excited students who asked, "Excuse me, do you  speak English? Where are you from? It is a very nice day, isn't it? Do  you like our country?" I learned to see the ambiguity of the phrase  "foreign expert." It didn't mean that my hosts valued me as an expert  critic who was also a foreigner; rather, I was an expert because I was a  foreigner.  I was the only foreign teacher working at this particular university.  Still, I had a cook assigned to serve me three meals a day, a gentle man  with a ready smile and a master of the styles of cooking that come  from Canton, Shanghai, and Peking, as well as ceremonial banquets.  He would spend most of his day preparing meals just for me (or for  two people, if there happened to be another foreigner passing through  and staying at the guest house). Sometimes I would come downstairs  to a meal, and he would greet me with a tickled expression, and ask,  "You like a some spaghetts?" and he would lay out a plate of homemade noodles in a very creditable tomato and onion sauce. Or it might  be "You like a some Chicken a la King?" or "How about some  orange-flavored pancakes?" Foods and dishes that I thought could  not be found in the whole country would materialize out of his kitchen  as if by magic. His self-taught English reminded me of my grandfather's, who had emigrated from Italy. Occasionally, in order to have  company at meals, I would insist on joining him in the kitchen; I could  not persuade him to come out and eat with me in the dining room. At  other times, for company, I would forsake the guest house entirely in  order to eat with the students in their cafeteria. He would try to  disguise his hurt feelings as well as he could, but he was never very  good at it.  Mr. Ling had been a chef in Shanghai before the war, and had  worked for a number of foreign restaurants, one owned by a Frenchman, another by an American. It was an indefensible waste of his skill 	asu06600000360004001							66911136 Bytes	3883	5742	909186067	RGB	8	600	asu06600000360004001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1695	1695	1696.jp2	/asu0660/image/1696.jp2
Inside the Great Wall					Palmeri, Frank																											asu0660000036	to assign him to cook for an insignificant foreign teacher or two in a  provincial backwater. He deserved to be living in Shanghai with his  wife, his children, and his grandchildren. But Mr. Ling was consigned  to cook for the single foreigner in what amounted to internal exile  because he had already been contaminated by his contacts before the  war with foreigners and their ways.  If I had read a little about the first contacts between the European  Jesuits and the Chinese, I might have been a little more prepared for  what I met with in China. The pioneering missionary Matteo Ricci,  for example, wrote to his friend Fabio de Fabii in 1608, after working  in China for twenty-five years, that "the Chinese place absolutely no  trust in any foreign country, and thus they allow no one at all to enter  and reside here unless they undertake never again to return home, as is  the case with us" (quoted in Jonathan D. Spence, The Memory Palace  of Matteo Ricci, p. 54). True, things have "opened up" a bit: I only  had to sign a contract for a year's service. But still, I was treated with  the same protective isolation that foreigners have experienced for centuries in China. I felt quarantined by the enclosures in which I lived,  especially those around my comfortable "foreign guest house." The  first of these barriers was a six-foot fence of spiked steel poles whose  gate was chained and locked shut after dark. Then there were the main  doors to the building, whose push bars were also chained and locked  at night. At this entryway sat an attendant behind a desk twenty-four  hours a day. I had an ongoing battle with my hosts about their policy  of making everyone who visited me sign their name in a book. With  straight faces, the authorities in the administration insisted that they  took all these measures, the chains, the locks, the signing-in, only to  insure my safety. I would think I had made it clear that I wanted no  such protection. They would promise that my vistors would not be required to sign in, and would agree to post a sign at the entrance saying  so in both Chinese and English. But then they would just ignore the  poster and the promise, and continue to make people sign in. Another  foreign expert at a different school was expelled after she stole the  guest book there, and burned it. Once, when I stopped teaching  classes until they agreed to stop it, I believe they did let visitors enter  unmolested for a day or two. But I'm sure that the monitoring began  again after a while, so I eventually stopped receiving anyone in my  room except those who came on official business. I made arrangements instead to meet people at various places on campus, or I  would visit them in their dormitories. But that made the authorities  uncomfortable, too. Clearly, the various barriers, the fences, walls,  locks, and signing-in procedures, served simultaneously to keep the  foreigner in as well as to keep the Chinese out. 	asu06600000360005001							66644160 Bytes	3896	5700	3192676043	RGB	8	600	asu06600000360005001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1696	1696	1697.jp2	/asu0660/image/1697.jp2
Inside the Great Wall					Palmeri, Frank																											asu0660000036	Those who visited me and brought along a friend or companion  didn't have to worry much. But those ran some risk who came to see  me by themselves, who walked around the campus alone with me,  without bringing along anyone to vouch for what was said. A Great  Wall gives a very misleading impression about such relations between  Chinese and foreigners. For one thing, the visiting Fang family are un-  realistically invited to stay at the home of their relatives, and the idea  is adopted on the spot (in the real China they would have to ask official permission far in advance to regulate such contaminating intimacy). But, even more glaringly, the film denies the grave consequences of excessively close relations between Chinese and foreigners  in the scene in which the Chinese daughter, Lili, spends an afternoon  on the patio of a western-style hotel at a table with three young foreign  men, wearing a loose American T-shirt and too much makeup, including bright red lipstick. Two party officials at another table look over  their shoulders disapprovingly at the calves that her foreign-style  pedal pushers leave exposed. This girl would not be able to go back to  her Chinese boy friend with no questions asked after the foreigners  leave, as she does in the movie. She would be so compromised by the  adopting of "loose" foreign ways that she might have a difficult time  finding a decent job or even getting married after such an episode. A  Great Wall is notable for being made jointly by Americans and  Chinese, the Americans taking responsibility and credit for the production and the script, but shooting on location in Peking using primarily Chinese actors and actresses. However, the script certainly had  to be approved by Chinese authorities, and a knowledge of the real  conditions on which it is based reveals how the Chinese manage quite  shrewdly to package an attractive image of their country inside a joint  cultural product. Unattractive rough edges disappear; unavoidable  consequences are avoided.  Once, while I was travelling during winter recess, I spent most of  the day in his home town with one of my most independent-minded  and intelligent students. I wanted to clear up something about my  travel papers, and I needed to visit a police station to do it, so I asked  my friend to go with me and help me out. My Chinese wasn't very  good, and neither was my grasp of what associating with a foreigner  can involve for a Chinese person. In the station, the police were all  smiles, and I didn't think anything was wrong when they asked my  friend to come with them to fill out some paperwork. But once they  were in another room, they interrogated him for thirty minutes about  what he was doing with me. Why was he keeping company with a  foreigner? What was his relationship to me? How long had he been  with me? Everything he told them went into a file detailing his 	asu06600000360006001							66507628 Bytes	3869	5728	385556350	RGB	8	600	asu06600000360006001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1697	1697	1698.jp2	/asu0660/image/1698.jp2
Inside the Great Wall					Palmeri, Frank																											asu0660000036	unauthorized, suspicious dealings with a foreigner. Then they let him  go with the news that they couldn't help me with my request; I would  have to go to an American consular office. He was so frightened when  we came out of the station that before he could tell me what had happened he had to find a public toilet. I've cursed my lack of care dozens  of times since. But the damage is done.  Out of concern for what it might mean to my Chinese friends to  receive mail from a foreigner, I decided when I left the country not to  write to anyone unless I had received a letter from them first. I'm  disappointed that some of my close friends and best students have  never written to me, but I reflect that they can judge better than I how  unwise it might be to correspond, and I console myself that maybe  I've finally developed a measure of prudence. I'm happy, even so, to  be corresponding with many of the people I liked and respected while I  was there, keeping up with them, exchanging news and views. I've  been somewhat surprised though at the number of my Chinese acquaintances who have written to me only in order to ask for my help  with one thing or another—recommendations mostly, but also many  requests that I provide the financial guarantees that our law requires  for visiting foreign students. I feel that I haven't simply been to China  and returned; I carried back with me the hopes of a number of  Chinese people who expect assistance from their only "foreign  friend" in America. The Chinese government and some Chinese people quietly assume that their cultural superiority is untouchable, yet  they are hungry to appropriate American and Western capabilities, to  swallow what we know, and willing afterwards pragmatically to discard what can't be used.  But, of course, we also cultivate images of China that play into the  hands of the Chinese public relations machinery, and that for its own  reasons the Chinese government is happy to confirm. The least usable  by the Chinese and also the most racist and insulting is the view of the  old China lobby (to which Ronald Reagan and his policy still adhere),  which sees "mainland" China as the source of hordes of despotic  yellow-skinned communists about to overrun the realms of democratic white-skinned Christians. At the opposite extreme, some envision China as a paradise still unspoiled by the taint of Western capitalism or by such modern blights as pollution and consumerism.  Those who see the country in this light (I confess to having been one of  them) go to China in order to travel back in time and recover an ideal  image of the past. Just as far from the truth as both of these, though,  is the recent image, enthusiastically propagated by American newspaper and television journalists and travel writers, of a China "opening up" to the West and to capitalism, an image that the Chinese do 	asu06600000360007001							66603680 Bytes	3869	5736	436049956	RGB	8	600	asu06600000360007001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1698	1698	1699.jp2	/asu0660/image/1699.jp2
Inside the Great Wall					Palmeri, Frank																											asu0660000036	very little to discountenance. Indeed, this perception comes very close  to the Chinese government's authorized view of the country as an ancient civilization which has undergone a completely successful revolution, and which is now energetically modernizing its economy by  opening itself to Western technologies in order to catch up with the  material accomplishments of the West and Japan. In truth, the Chinese economy is moving toward capitalism only at its peripheries, and  the country will certainly remain socialist and communist as far into  the future as anyone now alive can see. But the Chinese economy does  need the foreign exchange that tourists provide, and the official Chinese tourist agency is eager to see the country portrayed as an exotic  land of floating mountains in which the ancient and the modern are  melded in a unique and exciting hybrid. All travel agencies attempt the  equivalent, of course. But we seem peculiarly willing to take the  Chinese self-portrayal at face value, perhaps because for more than  two decades we had no official relations with China, and knew virtually nothing about what was going on inside its borders.  Books of striking photographs tend to support the exotic image of  the country. The beautiful pictures collected under titles such as Faces  of China present iconographic images of Factory Work, Fields at  Dawn, or Street Sweeping, but their static nature does not allow us to  see the arrangements that underlay their composition, the relations between photographer and subject that went into their production. The  public television series The Heart of the Dragon avoids such spectacular visual effects in order to provide a history textbook on China in  video form, each of its episodes like a chapter carrying a disguised  abstraction for a title: Believing, Eating, Creating. But the series pays  a price for its attempt to provide a neutral, objective view of the country and its culture: illustrating a cultural uncertainty principle, it  presents an encyclopedic range of facts and information about its subject, but silently omits any references to interactions between  authorities and filmmakers, or, more generally, to personal relationships between Chinese and foreigners. Or consider Arthur Miller's  pilgrimage to China soon after the death of Mao and the book that  resulted from his visit, Chinese Encounters, with beautiful  photographs by Miller's wife. As everyone knows, Miller went to  oversee a Chinese production of Death of a Salesman, an event which  does indicate a dramatic turnaround from the xenophobia of the Cultural Revolution. But such well-publicized performances of Western  classics hardly signal an "opening" of the country and its billion people to Western artistic and economic forms. Salesman, for example,  was not seen by more than a few thousand people altogether. It  showed only in Peking for a run of one week, and its audience con- 	asu06600000360008001							66392276 Bytes	3846	5752	1274350919	RGB	8	600	asu06600000360008001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1699	1699	1700.jp2	/asu0660/image/1700.jp2
Inside the Great Wall					Palmeri, Frank																											asu0660000036	sisted entirely of high officials, their families, and friends, who could  risk the potential contamination. Although Miller's book was certainly not written with any authorities looking over his shoulder (as was  the case for A Great Wall), his disarmingly frank text in fact contains  nothing that contradicts the official Chinese view of the country's recent past.  Whether in economics, tourism, or culture, the Chinese are as  adept as any Madison Avenue company at seizing opportunities for  good public relations, shaping people, expectations, and images to  produce the most attractive self-portrait. Their product is certainly  more sophisticated than the latest entry in the escalating fast food  advertising wars. The television commercials for McDonald's renamed Chicken McNuggets Shanghai begin by announcing that "East  meets West," then recommend that we "taste the Orient" by dipping  some fried chicken pieces in one of three sauces: sweet and sour,  teriyaki (needless to say, Japanese, not Chinese), or hot mustard.  Each order comes with a Mcfortune cookie and a pair of chopsticks,  which everyone in the ads is ostentatiously unable to use—except a  boy who ingeniously turns one into a skewer, slides three McNuggets  along it, and dips into all three sauces simultaneously.  The offer is good for a limited time only. Between this typically  American disposable, manageable (and consumable) image of another  culture, and China's tradition-honored suspicion and segregation of  contaminating otherness, I suppose both countries have a long way to  go in meeting each other half way.

Near Liberty City					Vinlove, Kathleen																											asu0660000036	Near Liberty City  by Kathleen Vinlove  The ice cream truck stops  and cranks out carousel tunes  as if to please a fairy ballerina  jailed within its chrome walls.  In rote ghost movements  she pirouettes, her breath making frost  while outside in the parking lot  of the Tamiami Motel Apartments  the children with arms akimbo  let the air out of their games,  leave their toys wheels spinning  in accidental motion. They gather  to memorize the truck's sun-faded rebus  before shuffling one by one through doorways  open to every evening and season, to this autumn  still humid in the ever green leaves.  And the mothers stirring low-flamed skillets  of spices and meat, who shift baby weight  on the scales of their hips,  decipher the too-sweet music,  the toll of the old deaf driver.  It is a daily performance,  the fat white woman rocking down the steps,  the mothers' spittled barks,  the gaggle of children who haven't yet learned  that no is the same in any language.  And when the vendor of many choices  shrinks off, they stand with faces  blank as sky, translating  what the dancer already knows  in her glazed smile, in her eyes  that leap through their private forest  where rain sheds its soft static  and the natives have no word for ice.

Now the hum  of traffic rattles past my stall,  a narrow table on the Place de la Madeleine  facing the imitation, cramped parthenon  stuffed with catholic icons. The Seine  is polluted and the stones of Paris run  with soap instead of blood.

Camera Obscura					De Maris, Ron																											asu0660000036	Camera Obscura  The globe of the eye, aqueous,  floats in its sea, a circle  on a white screen. Through this eye  steps a figure  to unlatch again and again  doors of a self  memory builds. Parts of each day  and leftover dreams  sift like confetti  in a glass paperweight  turned upside down.  The eye is a tyrant  of the visual feast, us  it devours. What force  can the mind throw against this?  A sea surface racked by storms  keeps its stilled center;  so the mind would still itself  like a bass in a quiet cave,  motionless, its inner eye awake  and seeing.  14 	asu06600000360016001							66621816 Bytes	3888	5710	2972794091	RGB	8	600	asu06600000360016001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1707	1707	1708.jp2	/asu0660/image/1708.jp2

Cloud Shadows					De Maris, Ron																											asu0660000036	16  Cloud Shadows  How sheep move in their bemused fogs,  legless in the summer valley,  they shift like chessmen  when your eye is turned: first one pattern  and then another, faces sunk in the swales  munching and praying.  And the valley cups its ridges  like the thumbed dough of a pie crust  abandoned and left to fill  with mesquite, sage and the wind  and rushes in a vast urgency  of unfinished business  to the stunned horizon. Only clouds  belong here  casting their puppet shadows  elephantine and innocent.  Beneath mesas,  at the edge of scooped rills,  across fields tilted in the sun,  they drift with the aplomb of fat women  booming their flat hieroglyphs  like the ghosts of ancient animals.  When the valley speaks,  the shadows are its syntax, the menhirs  of absence and the natural cisterns.  Everywhere red rock fades to red rock.  My car whines in the wind  following dry rivers. 	asu06600000360018001							67342504 Bytes	3939	5697	4217491661	RGB	8	600	asu06600000360018001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1709	1709	1710.jp2	/asu0660/image/1710.jp2

Voyeur					De Maris, Ron																											asu0660000036	Voyeur  Light falls short of his eye  and settles in a wrapt chimera  where the world carries on its conversations.  Puddles of light  recede before him or vanish  into wells  and even his own voice  takes on the veil of someone else  and disappears  where shadows move across planes of light  in a constant murmur for attention.  And within his clothes,  which turn around him as he moves,  he does not rest well.  There is always some part of him  half out of sleeve, between him  and the world  always a light that presses  too closely on the world he sees, a crystal  lymph in which all things,  reduced and fine, appear with a clarity  too bright to doubt:  in the wrapt bole of a cottonwood,  the gauze wings of an aphid.  18 	asu06600000360020001							67351452 Bytes	3916	5731	3603734984	RGB	8	600	asu06600000360020001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1711	1711	1712.jp2	/asu0660/image/1712.jp2

Writing The Lives of Viscaya					Harwood, Kathryn Chapman																											asu0660000036	Harwood, Kathryn Chapman. The lives of Vizcaya: annals of a great house.  Miami, Fla.: Banyan Press, 1985.  Kitty Harwood, at a meeting of the Friends of the University of Miami Library  in February, 1986, described the writing of her book. Following is an excerpt  from her talk.  Eventually I went researching in Italy, France, Spain, England,  and Ireland. I went on my own, alone, and I shudder now wondering  how I had the nerve. Three things helped: I was younger and a lot  greener and wanted madly to do it. Not knowing how to go about  anything, I simply ad-libbed, and never got tangled in protocol. There  are times, you know, when ignorance can be your ally. Remember  what Erich Maria Remarque said: "My father, a good man, told me,  'Never lose your ignorance, you can never replace it.' "  I should like to tell you of one of my unorthodox adventures, a  quite lovely one, I think. It happened in Spain in 1969.  I wanted to find where Vizcaya's famous Renaissance Hall rug had  come from, one of the rare rugs of the world, woven about 1450 for  the Hereditary Admiral of Castile, Fadrique Enriquez, the grandfather of Ferdinand the Catholic, husband of Isabella. It was said to  have come from the Convent of Santa Clara, near Palencia ("near"  meaning anywhere within a hundred miles). The Convent by then was  600 years old, and I wondered if there was anything left of it. Even the  New York Public Library and the Hispanic Society had only one or  two paragraphs about it. The Cloisters yielded a beautiful crucifix,  labeled "From the Convent of Santa Clara." I learned a good deal  about the Admiral, enough that I became quite attached to him. The  fifteenth century historian Pulgar described him as small, handsome  of face, a little shortsighted, and of good intelligence, kind to his  parents and to his nine sisters. He was also a fierce warrior, a scourge  of the sea. With such meager information I flew to Madrid and took a  train to Palencia. It was a lovely ride. The Escorial went sliding by  under a turbulent sky like an El Greco Painting.  "Alice in Wonderland" would have described the adventure better. Even the train was eccentric. Only by throwing off my luggage  and jumping after it did I land in Palencia before the train would have  carried me by. It was dark now and lonely. I trudged across a park to a  waiting taxi. I mentioned my hotel, but the driver refused either me or  my luggage. I argued. He got out of his car and waved his arms. I  didn't know I was already down the rabbit hole: the hotel was just  across the street.  20 	asu06600000360022001							66648160 Bytes	3877	5728	2977231812	RGB	8	600	asu06600000360022001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1713	1713	1714.jp2	/asu0660/image/1714.jp2
Writing The Lives of Viscaya					Harwood, Kathryn Chapman																											asu0660000036	I seemed to baffle the hotel clerk. A senora alone? Impossible. The  porter who took my bags frowned at me. I sat up half the night composing, via my dictionary, a note for the desk clerk the next morning:  did the Convent of Santa Clara still exist? If so could he get me a car  and reliable driver to take me there? When the clerk read the note the  following morning his eyes got big and he looked astounded. He read  the note to the porter and they stared at me. "Conventol" said the  clerk. I answered, "Si."  "Convento Santa Clara?" he asked unbelievingly. He said  something to the porter, a fatherly soul, who rose from his chair,  came and took my hand, and led me out on the sidewalk. He pointed.  The Convent was next door. I stood there gaping, till I realized I was  collecting interested onlookers. A woman draped in a shawl displayed  the baby in her arms, pointed to it, and sadly held out her palm. I  stepped across the street to take a picture of the Convent and my  claque went too, joined by children and a dog.  The Convent still had a beauty that nothing could spoil, good  Spanish-Gothic bones. The heavy quarter door was partly ajar and I  eased inside, aware, in the pale morning light, of massive piers and  pointed arches. A woman with tucked-up skirts was swabbing the  floor and she angrily brandished her mop at me. I retreated and set  out to explore the town.  It was a pretty little town with a park and trees and distant mountains wherever you looked, narrow streets, no traffic but a bicycle or  two, shops in no hurry to open, a small whitewashed theater advertising a 1920 Hollywood movie. I thought I looked like everybody else,  but children stopped playing and gawked at me; adults turned their  heads as I walked by. An antique shop was closed, but a small shop  with some books was just opening. Haltingly I asked for anything  about the Convent—a guidebook, perhaps?—but the proprietress  shook her head and led me down the street to a larger shop. Here I  bought two books, in Spanish alas, that had pictures and some brief  description of the Convent. Asking for a library or a museum only got  me blank looks. The book woman escorted me back down the street to  the antique shop that was open by now. There a delightful woman  struggled hard to understand what I wanted, finally ringing a number  on her telephone and handing me the receiver. A feminine voice spoke  English in my ear. She would meet me in an hour in the antique shop.  I bought a little silver bird and a sack of souvenirs and went to a bank  to replenish my Spanish money. It was no simple matter. They copied  things from my passport, handed me a chit to another department,  held a brief consultation and requested my signature, made polite inquiry if the exchange suited me, and went off and debated for quite a  21 	asu06600000360023001							66433280 Bytes	3864	5729	277696059	RGB	8	600	asu06600000360023001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1714	1714	1715.jp2	/asu0660/image/1715.jp2
Writing The Lives of Viscaya					Harwood, Kathryn Chapman																											asu0660000036	time. If they'd said "Off with her head" I wouldn't have been surprised.  The English voice turned out to be a brisk young woman who said  I should have stayed in Madrid where the records were. There was only one historian in Palencia and it would take a day to run him down. I  would learn nothing at the Convent . . . here she paused . . . except  what I could learn through my own eyes. Was it not the Convent I had  come to see? But from one of my books she read that, of the treasures  the Enriquez family had buried there, none remained, and from the  Convent had gone out in the twentieth century a magnificent series of  Spanish carpets of the fifteenth century, known as "The Admiral's  Rugs." Why had they sold everything? I asked. "Hard up," she answered. But that could not happen anymore; the government didn't  allow it. James Deering then had purchased the Admiral's rug and  Vizcaya's finest furnishings just before the lid was clamped down.  I went back to my hotel, the shawled lady and the baby stalking  me, dumped my impedimenta and had lunch, then went back to the  Convent. A kneeling woman looked up, her rosary slipping through  her fingers. A skinny little bright-eyed woman, all in black with a  scrap of lace on her head, popped out of a narrow sentry box. I  dropped some coins in her hand. She grinned a toothless grin and patted me on both shoulders. I sat about midway in the church before the  high altar with its vaulted dome. Shields of the Admiral's family were  carved in the keystones of the arches. I copied the names of all the admirals; my admiral was the second, son of the founder of the Convent. I wondered what had become of his tomb. There had been  nothing like it in all of Spain, a splendid sculpture in the shape of a  ship with masts, prow, and stern. It had stood in front of the altar.  Where had it gone? Had it been sold, too?  A solemn little boy, about ten, was shyly stealing looks at me. He  wore a red velvet cassock with white fur around neck and sleeves.  With him was a taller boy in black. I said, "Hello," and the boy in red  sat down beside me. I discovered he was eager to show me around. I  said, "Tomba, Fadrique?"  Instantly the boy jumped to his feet and began energetically dragging the pews around, making an awful racket on the stone floor. His  friend in black helped. The woman saying her prayers got up and  helped. The old woman in black came out and pushed. They were  clearing a great space in the body of the church. They stamped on the  floor and pointed down, saying, "Fadrique, Alfonso, Juana,  Pedro . . ."  The church was a pantheon of the Enriquez family. The stone was  marked  off in  squares—floor  markers,   each  bearing  individual  22 	asu06600000360024001							66736524 Bytes	3883	5727	3279912077	RGB	8	600	asu06600000360024001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1715	1715	1716.jp2	/asu0660/image/1716.jp2

I showed  them my photograph of the Admiral's rug and asked,  "Donde?"—where had it lain in the church? The old woman in black  seized my elbow and propelled me to the back of the church where she  made the motions of laying a rug. I pointed to the altar steps instead,  but she stamped her foot and shook her head.  The boy in red tugged my sleeve. I tried not to look, but could not  refuse, for he was so proud to show me their saint. They all stood admiringly looking at it, a gruesome blackened mummified figure in a  glass-enclosed case, half reared up, with terrible claws and one wisp of  hair. They kept saying "agua mucho" and flapping about. The old  woman fell down and pretended to drown. They played at cutting  their hair with imaginary scissors. They trimmed their fingernails, trying to make the senora understand that the saint had floated on the  tide to Palencia and that its hair and fingernails kept on growing. The  old lady finally threw up her hands in disgust.  I went back to my hotel to make arrangements for tomorrow's  early departure, but I promised to come back and the boy in red said  he'd wait for me. He looked at me with clear, serious eyes. An offer of  money would have been incongruous.  It was dusk when I returned and a mass was being said at which the  boy in red was serving. I sat where I had sat before. I noticed a hole,  like a wound, in a wall. There, perhaps, the crucifix had hung? I  wished it were back. I wished the Admiral still lay in his tomb. I  wished his rug lay on the floor. And then, for some reason, it occurred  to me that in all this time I had not seen a single nun. That surprised  me, but only for a moment. More than likely the Convent, after 600  years, did not function as a Convent anymore.  The twilight deepened. Mass was ended and people left. Suddenly  there came flooding from back of me the sound as of chiming little  bells—feminine voices were chanting one high note. At the rear of the  church was a wrought iron grille, in back of which hung a heavy curtain. From there, I realized, the sound was coming. I got up and began  to walk back toward it. The old woman popped out of her sentry box  and vigorously shook her finger at me. All hell, though, wasn't going  to stop me. I reached through the grille and pushed a corner of the  curtain aside.  There sat the nuns of Santa Clara, the Poor Clares, dedicated to  poverty, an order enduring from the twelfth century. They wore black  habits and veils with white bibs and coifs. They were seated in a  horseshoe shape, their leader in the center with her back to me. They  sat like statues, serious and unsmiling, chanting together. Surely the  Admiral, I thought, had once stood where I was standing, Vizcaya's  23 	asu06600000360025001							67819784 Bytes	3939	5737	4054338272	RGB	8	600	asu06600000360025001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1716	1716	1717.jp2	/asu0660/image/1717.jp2

Night Swim					De Maris, Ron																											asu0660000041	THE  CARRELL  Volume 29 1991  Ron De Maris  Night Swim  There is the history of the self and the history  of a city and the two  occasionally merge as when my foot  in this warm water off Key Biscayne  becomes a part of the alluvial sands  connected to the moon,  an old lover, rising huge, dependable  as pain and sex and the burning bush of the spirit.  The hum of the city at night is everywhere,  and I tune my pain into it, let it flow  through my nerves like a warm drug and all  the brashness of it, its arrogant energy,  its green geometries of light, the constant  growling of its roads and engines  play against the soothing water which now fills  my trunks and washes around my testicles,  and even the moon is reaching to me across the water  with its fingers of light.  What better than a night swim in the ocean's  rough indifference  to cure the day's ills, its pathetic interrogations?  I can feel the salt healing  me again, the black abyss of the horizon  ready to swallow me whole  anytime.

Bahia Honda Key  There is the mood of blue and then the color,  a grackle's wing shaking the sun,  the final tide when the sea  will run off the edge and drain  like they said it would;  the pit of the ocean roils  and turns the surface slowly like a ladle.  We walk the abandoned bridge  curving out of the water as oddly  as a ribbed spine;  below us the island  is fringed in a skirt of waves, green  deepening to blue, royal robes,  night circled, dark as space:  the whole earth turning in that current.

III. One Brush Stroke  One brush stroke  and a charcoal cloud  lifts, a village appears,  brass water, a cove,  boats tethered  to their own reflections.  The road unravels behind me  in a steady rumble of wheels  and a pelican  coming straight on  passes my car like a ghost  one eye fixedly staring  hauling the cove and its boats  to a dark downturning of waters.

IV. The Man Who Ate Sharks  To keep the ocean at bay  he must back off  from the large space  he is always ready to plunge into.  There is in him now  this strange yawing  that wants to eat  the little bridges.  Fishermen asleep over their lines  wash blue green rivers  with bait. The chugging tide  works for them. He hovers  uncertainly in the heat shimmer;  small islands  surface like turtles  who would drink the sky  in their slow gaze but he  is insatiable.  He takes the edge of the shoreline  and hugs it  tentatively. It leads somewhere.  A heavy space hauls his leeward gills.  The flutes of his breathing  stir. He is sensing something  to hurl his bulk against.  His jaw drops and makes  a great whiteness everywhere. 	asu06600000410006001							66977368 Bytes	3880	5752	3937279927	RGB	8	600	asu06600000410006001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1726	1726	1727.jp2	/asu0660/image/1727.jp2
The Flaw					De Maris, Ron																											asu0660000041	The Flaw  Somewhere beyond the change of seasons  is a single path,  not care worn with mind's memory or the civility  of the wind,  but pure as the first passing there.  You have seen it often  when, attention distracted, you looked  down an unfamiliar road  and returned with a different eye,  nothing again the same.  There was that road and so that plain  that opened up beneath the busy clouds,  and grazing there,  cattle in a bovine peace  without censure or abrasion.  Or it was a cobbled path  beside a mews, a townhouse and a town  where people strolled their dogs and lay along  convivial river banks  to watch the sun go down;  and you passed it and went on,  while the busy step on streets you've always known  changed in tempo, the clear eyes  of friends and lovers  clouded. Even the simplest impedimenta  scattered among the day's  obligations, can acquire a small  blank space,  at once a blossom and a mystery,  possibility of absence  and emblem of the ideal.  Is purity within the mind or without?  Or is it the flaw  itself, destroying each scene it touches  with a Medusa gaze? 	asu06600000410007001							67654316 Bytes	3931	5735	4049944106	RGB	8	600	asu06600000410007001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1727	1727	1728.jp2	/asu0660/image/1728.jp2
The Thing That Waits for You					De Maris, Ron																											asu0660000041	The Thing That Waits for You  The thing that waits for you  bides its time among the blue lilies  rolling over the lake  hidden in the morning fog. The thing  that waits for you is the empty space  where you turned a corner  and failed to meet  someone you could have known  for a lifetime. In the blue corners  of the afternoon are the people  you did not hear  and all they had to tell you  is gone without ever arriving.  How can we solve this maze, this press  of faces demanding this  and that of us?  The thing that waits for you  is at the end of the questions  you did not ask, it is  the teacher who taught well  but did not teach you, the chapter  you gave up on, the look  you did not see on a friend's face  before he turned against you.  The thing that waits for you  has no enmity, no delight  in your early sorrow, it is always  late in its arrivals, unannounced,  like the party crasher who steals  the party, it changes everything  to something else,  something healing or something frightful  6 	asu06600000410008001							67369260 Bytes	3909	5743	4094440104	RGB	8	600	asu06600000410008001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1728	1728	1729.jp2	/asu0660/image/1729.jp2

The thing that waits for you  is not good or bad, it is what is  and cannot be seen, though others  see it, you do not  until too late and you cannot know it  even then. The thing that waits for you  is the mirror beside the mirror  in the fun house of a child:  you see your profile for the first time,  a stranger's nose, a stranger's chin  or on tape you hear your voice,  a stranger's voice, a ghost self  all others see but you do not,  ghost selves that carry on  either with or without you;  the thing that waits for you  is the clear window without mirrors  when the fog has lifted and the healing sun  spreads its truth. 	asu06600000410009001							67347968 Bytes	3929	5712	733658325	RGB	8	600	asu06600000410009001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1729	1729	1730.jp2	/asu0660/image/1730.jp2

The red road  curls in the darkness,  a shape without shape, at odds  with itself,  for how to be imagined when the dull  gray morning  meets the dull gray day and crows  caw in the bare branches?  2  This is the place where the road  emerges,  a red stripe in the black land,  and the hand,  without apologies, twists the brush  in a torque of color  too bold for winter.  What has the heave of earth to say  that weighs the road like a bird  pushed down by wind?  The red road is its own sun,  its trees backlit by flame,  and the whole, sorry collapse of winter 	asu06600000410010001							66303996 Bytes	3864	5718	4200764557	RGB	8	600	asu06600000410010001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1730	1730	1731.jp2	/asu0660/image/1731.jp2

What world  cannot be changed by a thought?  5  In yellow woods blue horses  huddle close, their flanks as smooth  as flint, their breath  rising in white plumes.  Undersides of leaves are red, a red  maple shedding its autumn frost, clouds  cavernous licked  by burnt orange,  and beyond the woods  a girl is reading in a red  room.  Her mind is the color of summer. 	asu06600000410011001							67536844 Bytes	3907	5760	4225492788	RGB	8	600	asu06600000410011001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1731	1731	1732.jp2	/asu0660/image/1732.jp2
Green Heron					De Maris, Ron																											asu0660000041	10  Green Heron  He skulks at the edge of canals  beside the dump where the town's refuse  eddies in whirlpools,  ghostlike in reeds,  risen from the millenial seep of rain  leeching through marshlands,  dwarf cousin to the white, the blue,  who glide over the flat savannah  with the indifference of kings.  He picks his way along the shore,  hunched up, nervously darting,  owning a name that conjures  aerial gardens:  green heron  in the deepest rain  a lone gray shape.  In the shadow of stumps  he is the shadow that moves, at the base  of the banyan  he is the color visible:  a fan of colors  all one color  spectral heron.  He is the roadrunner  without a road, through the pathless forest  the eye  replacing another in a bright nimbus  of doubt. He is a bafflement  passed on  in the flickering wind:  green heron in a green  shade who calls  your name? 	asu06600000410012001							67434960 Bytes	3895	5769	1951773698	RGB	8	600	asu06600000410012001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1732	1732	1733.jp2	/asu0660/image/1733.jp2

"Darker than Amber"					Schmitt, Peter, 1958-																											asu0660000041	f  Peter Schmitt  "Darker than Amber"  i.  It is my eleventh birthday.  Down at the corner—commotion!  Outside our local theater,  people in seeming disarray,  dozens of them, and cameras  on dollies, a director's crane  swooping like a cherry-picker,  the smell of popcorn and liquor,  and—to my widening eyes, plain  as night is day—men half my size,  dwarfs and midgets, up to the thighs  of girls in sequinned leotards.  Stuck midst all this ephemera:  the stoplight on amber caution.  —The moviehouse turned inside out,  a gift for me! Transformed, in fact,  one block of the business district  of our suburb: any child's dream,  the oppressively humid steam-  cleaners next door now an ice cream  parlor, papered in cool gingham!  Each storefront changed. . . .Thinking, no doubt,  of the money it might bring them  (and possibly a chance to act?),  our town fathers, normally strict,  have thrown doors wide, glad to be picked  for what is chalked on the take-slate  that stops us like a railroad gate:  for "Darker than Amber," to star  Rod Taylor in the title role  of Travis McGee, MacDonald's  (John D.) South Florida hero.  12 	asu06600000410014001							67041884 Bytes	3900	5728	2509168817	RGB	8	600	asu06600000410014001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1734	1734	1735.jp2	/asu0660/image/1735.jp2
"Darker than Amber"					Schmitt, Peter, 1958-																											asu0660000041	But just past ten, the Hardy Boys  are all I know of mysteries  and the dark side of adulthood.  Then a megaphone stills the noise,  interrupting all the stories  I'm hearing exchanged, a zero  of silence formed round a boom mike  I can see over all the heads.  And up the friendly street I bike  each day, where I'm king, roars a car.  By morning it's gone, all facades  ripped like masks from the old features,  business even more usual  than before, with all the luster  of the day after a birthday.  Still, to know the street could muster  enough charm or something special  to lure all those splendid creatures—  unless it just fit some spatial  requirement, or visual—  is a confirmation of sorts,  that here where I'm heroes and gods  of make-believe intrigues and sports,  is where grownups, too, like to play.  II. A Dozen Years Later  It's late on a Saturday night,  TV's on, a small black-and-white  in an otherwise dark room, tuned  to the upcoming movie, which,  as the opening credits roll,  casts my brain reeling in rewind  to find the appropriate frame.  The set glimmering like the moon,  it all comes back: the movie's name,  the filming that night I had watched,  its eventual "R" rating  (why I'd not seen it), and the real  reason I'll stay up now, waiting:  the childhood street left years behind.  13 	asu06600000410015001							66961176 Bytes	3888	5739	3733073810	RGB	8	600	asu06600000410015001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1735	1735	1736.jp2	/asu0660/image/1736.jp2
"Darker than Amber"					Schmitt, Peter, 1958-																											asu0660000041	I  I settle back to watch the case  unfold, clue by clue: there's McGee  aboard his Busted Flush, his pal  Meyer; their seen-it-all, brusque jokes  set an edgy tone. I won't see  on this TV where the title  comes in (MacD.'s trademark brushstroke  on each McGee book), but I pull  my chair closer, and try to guess:  the Eurasian—is it my set  or are her eyes what's "darker than. . ."?—  Or a sunset? My thoughts idle  like green detectives parked in vans,  watching, taking what they can get.  Parked, until—a swinging stoplight  arrests my attention, the view  pulling back to reveal a street  empty and dark, on either side  ghostly buildings—I know this block!—  and up the street at a fast walk,  heels clattering in the silence,  comes a form—who is she?—quick strides  moving shadowless, each shop light  extinguished. And then, distantly,  as if out of memory, cued,  come tire peel and fishtail violence,  and the car leaps the curb, straightens,  and hits her—she's dead, instantly.  —And before I know what's hit me,  the movie has moved on. It's clear,  now, what I had missed all those years  ago: how my block from childhood  turns out to be the murder scene.  I had heard the car—what hid me  from the stuntgirl (or mannequin?)  smacking the wall—that thick, wild crowd?  Who knows. But McGee and Meyer  begin to sort the facts, and I'm  left to wonder what is required  in one vision, to freeze ice cream  out of laundry, then again,  14 cast bright suburb in urban crime. 	asu06600000410016001							66220860 Bytes	3841	5745	74485716	RGB	8	600	asu06600000410016001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1736	1736	1737.jp2	/asu0660/image/1737.jp2
"Darker than Amber"					Schmitt, Peter, 1958-																											asu0660000041	Maybe it's the contrast, so stark  here on the screen in black and white,  between the director's image  and my own sunny remembrance;  or film's illusive permanence,  but I feel forced to reappraise  (despite my first-hand evidence)  the aspect of those childhood days  as I've kept them, a warm visage  glowing in memory: bike parked  at the bakery, creamy, light  cookies on my tongue like wafers.  Or down alleys, the bike mid-flight.  Like heat-mirage, each frame wavers.  Because what's to say the errand  into town wasn't equally  escape from something wrong at home,  the bike ride not infrequently,  not out of choice, taken alone—  on our block, no other children.  And yet what tend to be recalled  are not the anguishes, at all,  but moments, gilded, resinous  with a kind of innocent glaze—  the mind acting, apparently,  as an editor whose film sense  drops almost without hesitance  plot, for the favored scene or phrase.  Call them, these cherished stills, like lengths  of old, yellowing celluloid,  negatives transformed: by the warm,  preserving bath of years, into  something durable and lasting  no one's dire vision can undo.  What will always be remembered  is that the street on film at most  is fictional; that the amber  of memory holds true. One's left  a fluky double exposure,  part real, part not, that can inform  a looking-back with an alloyed  sense of balance, and of closure. 15 	asu06600000410017001							66687740 Bytes	3856	5763	2627600682	RGB	8	600	asu06600000410017001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1737	1737	1738.jp2	/asu0660/image/1738.jp2

Movement (After Seventy Springs)					Lorenz, Johnny																											asu0660000041	Johnny Lorenz  Movement (After Seventy Springs)  When I am reminded of days I've long stepped out of,  I am like a tree blown back by the wind. How is it  that so many of my moments now are spent  on moments I left behind, when I was still growing out  of my own body, when I had fewer branches? I cannot  breathe the same air twice; even just now, that sweet breath  that passed between my lips is irretrievable, but let it go—  let it lose itself in the restless wind as a leaf would.  We move forward, and in circles, led around  by the slow hurricane. The things that blew by me  I squeezed into my pockets; my eyes took some,  as did my ears, the pores of my skin,  my mouth. There must be little room left.  And how easy it is to slip into the rippled waters  of memory, my gentle, lapping drug.  The days I've remembered are the simple ones,  the small stones that fit nicely in my hand.  But water, memory, has made white raisins of my fingers;  I need to think on the making.  There is still time for a song  no songbird has feathered,  and my own whiffled melodies  will give flight to who I was: I danced  in the wind, and I danced with the wind.  I will trace my last circle and meet the sun  on the other side where it's only an orange moon.  The day will come, I will move in step with the wind,  and I will leave through the same door I came in.  17 	asu06600000410019001							67892164 Bytes	3908	5789	3959658140	RGB	8	600	asu06600000410019001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1739	1739	1740.jp2	/asu0660/image/1740.jp2

But the graves are gone  Or moved perhaps,  Broken stone crypts aslant in the  Tall grasses where goats looked out  With horizontal pupil, inscrutable eye,  Or hoof clacked across an ancient grave  In the still, wide, sun-filled air.  We found them again at our crossroad stop  Under high vaulting of leaves and branches,  Slow filter of leaf drip from Woman's Tongue,  A soft tremolo the pods make swaying, where  In a lean-to shack called Lone Eagle Bar  We schemed the venture, the reef you traced  Down island, beyond Tortola, the edge.  18 	asu06600000410020001							67143008 Bytes	3917	5712	744759251	RGB	8	600	asu06600000410020001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1740	1740	1741.jp2	/asu0660/image/1741.jp2

Still trying to make it work back at the bridge,  Shouting about poetry and jazz.  Old friends turned in academic scorn.  Street people, last loyalty, wrote the final line.

Consider the stare  through which mere images are formed  into a song of bones, a fire whose words bare  the penalty of time without a care.  He betrays the noble history of scorn  whose feelings are spent unthought upon the air  of common life, hovering, uncommerced. The stairs  these thought beatings tread are torn  from the song whose body is the fire that dares  burn inherited wood as if its own. Time shares  the painter's craft, twists the solid form  into feelings brought to life, considers fair  its own distortions free from hand but not the stare  that turns accident into sign, its justice known  by the song it makes of bones, the flames it dares.  Life's passion is to think. Interpret is to care  for the back-cradled rock and overcome.  If feelings are lived ideas, think noble the stare.  From songs comes a fire whose words we share.  25 	asu06600000410027001							65486296 Bytes	3821	5711	2075018387	RGB	8	600	asu06600000410027001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1747	1747	1748.jp2	/asu0660/image/1748.jp2

I keep twirling  about in my seat to view  the two huge antennae overhead from diverse  angles. We round a seaside bluff  which partially blocks our view of the summit,  Thomas brakes, then halts at roadside—we're to witness drama  in progress: Oho!, my driver remembers aloud,  "Today's de date for installing  de new Cable  & Wireless antenna on de mountain top  alongside dem two giant  Overseas Radio and Power & Electric towers."  Beaming his winsomest smile, Thorn  predicts massive islandwide power outages, chaos,  panic will rule today: "You'll get quite an eyefull, Word Mon,  sit tight, and take in de circus." We observe two men  relaying yells with walkie-talkies:  one appears shrunk  to pygmy size, poised atop the Peak  beside the taller antenna,  while his mate below, at the mountain's foot,  monitors the long thick cable  of an unmanned tramcar with one hand, and holds  the two-way-radio box with the other. He shifts from earpiece  to mouthpiece and back so quickly, I'm wondering  how either member of this skilled team  can give or receive,  audibly, the messages bandied to and fro.

And now  the long dragline accelerates,  snug tramcar dropping fast, faster. The two men,  above and below, seem vaguely alarmed: their muted interchange  rises in volume, though only a few high-pitched  voice squeaks reach our ears, seated  in the Toyota truck.  The bottom man, just a dozen meters  from our wheels, works heatedly  to brake the zooming payload with his crank  and gears (O how does he manage,  I wonder, to find enough grappling-rigor of fists  to perform these maneuvers without ever releasing the two-way  ham radio from his grasp? Perhaps he clamps soundbox  between his jaw and clavicle, his moves  so quick and adroit  I can't be sure); unloosing the crank  lever, he runs—in mild panic—  toward the speeding tram, as if to cushion  its fall, or catch any dislodged  contents. The metal crib lands with a thud, bounces,  once or twice, upon twin semi-truck-tires anchored at the foot  of the cable run to soften impact of heavy loads.  One smallish spearlike pole flops out,  nearly strikes the tram  operator in his temple, then lands,  twisting, at his feet—who swerves  his unhelmeted skull just in time, ducking clear  29 	asu06600000410031001							66071424 Bytes	3843	5729	2346070273	RGB	8	600	asu06600000410031001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1751	1751	1752.jp2	/asu0660/image/1752.jp2

His teammate,  perched hundreds of meters above, cheers the result. I surmise  that lesser mishaps are deemed business as usual,  small blunders held a matter of course:  the glow of success  plastered on both guises. Are the men  trying to save face, in presence  of witnesses—ourselves, I ask Thomas?, who hazards  a guess, knowing each of his Citizen  Fellows' private quirks and oddments as few of us know  our own families'. "Dem ignore us," says he. "De segments  of old antenna and engine parts are discards  anyhow, so dey works more for speed  den care, at dis stage.  But you'll see a shift to uttermost  vigilance, when dey transport  parts of de new Cable and Wireless antenna  to Chance's Peak, later today. . ."  The tramway, he'd have me know, is recent adjunct,  less than three months old. Before that, all machinery, petrol,  tools and large antenna parts had to be carted uphill  manually, propped on "we shoulders"  or hillside wheelbarrows.  And that process would keep dozens  of Montserrat's hale muscly  laborers swaggering up and down the mountain  for weeks. Nowadays, the entire  transport and assemblage in situ will be mastered  by the swift troop of experts, no more than five or six in all.

And I, hoping to end  this interlude on an upnote, effuse:  "Thank God for indestructible  truck tires, recycled for safety-net-catch,  whatever the mountain may send  hurtling their way: treads falling off one, the other  balled treadless and sporting a fist-sized gap where a blowout—  which may have sent the truck plunging into a ditch—  terminated the jumbo tire's first life,  reborn as all-absorbent  rubber pillow. . . ."

Poems of The Eye: La Bohème in Coral Gables					Emery, Clark Mixon, 1909-																											asu0660000041	Clark Emery  Poems of The Eye  La Boheme in Coral Gables  Some forty or more years ago (once upon a time) I taught a two-  semester course in Literary Criticism (from Aristotle to Eliot) to a group  of students so swift, so sharp, and so severe that they completed a  semester's work in half the time allotted. The question arose: How to  fill the ensuing weeks? The answer rose with the question: with practical criticism.  I was at the time interested in what Hugh Kenner was later to call  The Pound Era and in its proliferating isms—Imag-, Vortic-, Dada-,  Futur-, Surreal-, and the like. I offered this class the opportunity of  forming a similar artistic cult. Within a few days they had met,  disagreed, agreed, organized, formulated contradictory manifestoes (to  be read simultaneously in the time-honored way), and chosen a name:  The Eye. It was a brilliant choice (even though lacking an ism), the  name suggesting a source of vision, affirmative action (the ayes have  it), and a point of vantage for the seer (the ego's-eye view from the  still point of the turning hurricane).  It happened, luckily, that one class-member was house-sitting the  mansion of Gold Coast European travelers. This became our weekly  meeting-place.  Also, luckily, it happened that attached to our group was a young  man with a printing-press and a talent for fine printing. We decided  at once to publish a series of chapbooks.  So, in surprisingly short order, we had an organized cult, a splendid meeting-place, and a publishing program. And because we had to  do something in the regular class meetings, something which would give  the cult meetings some added cohesiveness, we decided to study the  Cantos of Ezra Pound.  Word of the delight and instruction produced by the meetings spread  from gown to town; outsiders joined. I was told later that three Communists accompanied by two FBI Agents attended one meeting. No  doubt apocryphal—but if they did attend, they were well-behaved.  The meetings—which involved poetry readings, music recitals,  political discussion, and forensics on all subjects—continued into the  Spring semester, chapbooks being published, Pound being illuminated  34 	asu06600000410036001							67214944 Bytes	3902	5740	1540313670	RGB	8	600	asu06600000410036001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1756	1756	1757.jp2	/asu0660/image/1757.jp2

A small theater being vacated, we decided to have a drama-  writing contest and to do a public presentation of the winning play.  The play, which never got to off-Broad way, was played, chapbooks,  paintings and etchings offered for sale in the lobby, music by a cult-  member was performed between the acts. A good time, as they say,  was had by all. It was a fitting climax to the most inspiriting (and nerve-  racking) Lit Crit class I ever taught.  Of the members of The Eye, one became a Pulitzer Prize winner,  one an editor of a Jewish newspaper, one a protege of Pound, one a  poetical etching professor, one a novelist, one a race-horse owner, one  a bookshop owner, and one a successful painter in oils.  A varied lot but not a motley group. I shall not see their like again—  they, and their compatriots, each in her/his way, green, ripe, or rotten, an apple of The Eye.  Following are poems from each of the four chapbooks published by The Eye, as described in the memoir by Professor  Emeritus Clark Emery. Ronald Perry, a graduate student at  the University of Miami, went on to publish two volumes of  poetry, The Rock Harbor (Swallow Press, 1959) and Denizens  (Random House, 1980), a selection of the National Poetry  Series. Perry died in Nassau in 1982. Ingeborg Kayko, a Mia-  mian poet discovered by The Eye, never published a volume  of poetry; she committed suicide in 1951. Donald Justice, who  studied and taught at the University of Miami, published The  Summer Anniversaries (1959), which was the Lamont poetry  selection for that year; Night Light (1967); Departures (1973);  and Selected Poems (1979), which won the Pulitzer Prize.

Easter, 1954					Perry, Ronald, 1932-																											asu0660000041	Ronald Perry  Easter, 1954  With apostles and proprieties  Of spring, the wind comes April long  In sidling tongues,  And round our window's white  Plague month, the Heaven-tree  Leafs dark as friends.  Look! The clock-faced grandfathers  Are sitting shy  In their walks and rooms,  To kindergartens of roses. . . .  Winter wrinkles in their blood:  Disheveled April, season's end.  The millioned water hives.  Corridors of the ear  Spill out birdsong like churches,  And the birds spit lanterns out.  The walking wind unravels  The dark and worlds aloud.  Here shells seed, and gardens  Of our ripped and hollow saints devise  And celebrate with psalms  The palm-eyed child. April,  Season's beginning. The spring bleats  With wives or any green sound.  from The Fire Nursery  Chapbook by the Eye  36 	asu06600000410038001							67393960 Bytes	3905	5751	3072717701	RGB	8	600	asu06600000410038001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1758	1758	1759.jp2	/asu0660/image/1759.jp2
Strangler Fig and Captive Tree					Kayko, Ingeborg																											asu0660000041	Ingeborg Kayko  Strangler Fig and Captive Tree  At first you do not know I send  the sentient fingers of my root  to inward where your juices blend  the rain and mineral and soot,  you burrow deep so I can feed  in crevices in your chambered bark,  on conduits flowing for my need,  and as I feast your leaves turn dark  and come no more, but I am grown  into the shape of our embrace  and last without you stand alone,  inheriting your captive space.  Why must you plead for one more fall  of your own fruit to give the ground?  Am I not more than any small  and dubious seed? I shall be found  though alien substance, with your cast,  your contour pressed into my stance.  Are you not singled out to last  for more than your continuance?  from Strangler Fig and Captive Tree  Chapbook by The Eye  37 	asu06600000410039001							65583676 Bytes	3824	5715	1823446300	RGB	8	600	asu06600000410039001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1759	1759	1760.jp2	/asu0660/image/1760.jp2
An Old-Fashioned Devil					Justice, Donald, 1925-2004																											asu0660000041	Donald Justice  An Old-Fashioned Devil  Tu le connais, lecteur, ce monstre d&licat . . .  BAUDELAIRE  Who is it snarls our plow lines, wastes our fields,  (Jnbaits our hooks, and fishes out our streams?  Who leads our hunts to where the good earth yields  To marshlands, and we sink, but no one screams?  Who taught our children where the harlot lives?  They gnaw her nipples and they drain her pap,  Clapping their little hands like primitives  With droll abandon, bouncing on her lap.  Our wives adore him; us he bores to tears.  Who cares if to our dry and yellow grass  He strikes a match or two, then disappears?  It's only the devil on his flop-eared ass—  A beast too delicate to bear him well—  Come plodding by us on his way to hell.

Elegy					Donovan, Laurence, 1927-																											asu0660000041	Laurence Donovan  Elegy  The small wind whispers  Of a tall forest's other time.  Her eyes, now filled with leaves,  Once worked his wooden love.  Shake, O shake with sorrow  The enormous dreaming trees,  The veined departure.  Perhaps he steps timidly now  Among familiar silences.  Shake, but shake  As the wind shakes in sorrow  A far country of leaves,  The dissolving map of grief.  Thick into a dark for him  He walks the blown cathedral.  Eyewild at footfall,  Leaves whirl dreamily  Up in the wind, whisper.  Perhaps he moves in the time  Of the tall forest, timid  In trees, while the eyes  Of leaves watch in the wind.  Shakes as the wind shakes.  Love's whisper is a perfect cry.  \  from Serena's Speaker  Chapbook by The Eye  39 	asu06600000410041001							65496920 Bytes	3827	5703	1444146617	RGB	8	600	asu06600000410041001.tif		2012-11-29	2012-11-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asu0660/id/1761	1761	1762.jp2	/asu0660/image/1762.jp2
