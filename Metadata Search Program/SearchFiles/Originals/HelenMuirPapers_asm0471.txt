We'll wait and see."  "First summer performance at the Playhouse was the great Kreskin, ESP expert."  "You'll be interested to know Bill Clemmer and his group on Florida Ave. have been joined [by] other groups occupying the small houses to the east with the result that quite a nice community of artists and artisans has sprung up."

Helen Muir letter to Teresa Heinz, May 28, 1994		Muir, Helen, 1911-		Helen Muir writes, "I apologize for the lapsed time since your May 12th request for information about Marjory Stoneman Douglas. I am on deadline for a book and therefore the mail suffers. MSD and I have been friends for sixty years, since I arrived from N.Y.C. in 1934 as a working journalist. We live on the same Coconut Grove street. She has earned all the honors she has won for her persistence about the Everglades. Last November I attended the White House ceremony when President Clinton awarded her the Freedom Medal. So there is no doubt about her acceptability. What I like about the Heinz Award is that it carries money along with it and that has always been in short supply for Marjory. The State of Florida purchased her house to provide her with income. On her death (she will be 105 next April 7th) the house will be turned into a sort of museum in her memory. I am happy to hear that the Heinz Family Foundation is considering my old friend."
