Page 1																								Dec Sunday night     I dont know the day of the month. We had a new episode this morning. Horace Prescott of Co. C & Ephraim Pettingill of Co. E deserted broke out of the Gd House about 7 1/2 last Eve, & Skedaddled for parts unknown in Rebeldom. Prescott was under arrest for Forgery.    The Citizens had sold stuff to the Soldiers & taken Sutler Checks for Pay, & Prescott forged notes using the Capts (of several Cos.) names; & exchanged them for these checks; he got some $50.00 worth of them he was courtmartialed two or three days ago but his sentence has not been promulgated yet; probably the Ball & Chain was not an agreeable piece of Jewelry to wear so he left, I dont know the offence of Pettingill, he is a reckless fellow, & I am glad they are out of the Regt, but if they get caught Death to them.    Prescott has always been petted by House				asm0383000044						asm03830000440001001		45574768 Bytes	3096	4904	1993939912	RGB	8	600	asm03830000440001001.tif		2012-06-04	2012-06-04	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0383/id/21	21	23.jp2	/asm0383/image/23.jp2

E. went out on the Jacksonville Road but it is lucky they did not overhaul them as they have Revolvers & would not hesitate to shoot either of the Capts I have heard several of C's boys hope that Prescott would shoot House; rather tough that! if my Co felt like that toward me I would get out of it if possible.    It is awful dull no news no mail or anything to interest.

I think I shall go into Capt Rollins Mess; I cant stand everything more than a sheep. Mrs. A is to almighty sluttish & that is a thing I was never used to at home; & I cant stand it of a woman anywhere; from a man or Nigger cook, I could get over it better; 3 times out of 5 my knife & fork are covered with new rust, that rubs off on my vittuals; she is a d____d f__l anyway so is he.

I dont know what to say to give you consolation, keep good courage & I trust ere this reaches you, that you will be better It seems a little singular what you think is the matter should occur at your age, but I dont know much about it; my first Wife was as much as 90 before she found "thats whats the matter"    Beauregard has turned over Cate & his party to the tender mercies of the Gov of Fla to be tried as Insurrectiontists, with the view of hanging them; Gen Hunter has got three citizens of this place, & plenty of Soldiers as Hostages; & sent word to Beauregard that he would hang two for one, it dont seem as if the rebels will proceed to the extremity of hanging prisoners I presume Prescott would swear against Cate if he is in the vicinity, as Cate pulled him up on stealing the Whiskey, if they hang them I should like the priveledge of ranging over this state with full powers I would give every man I met the choice of the Oath of allegience or Death, & three minutes to decide.    I dont know what to say about Heath & the House but it is my impression that it is best to let the thing soak & see what it looks like in the spring, I think it will be quite				asm0383000055						asm03830000550001001		78739816 Bytes	3417	7679	845777770	RGB	8	600	asm03830000550001001.tif		2012-06-04	2012-06-04	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0383/id/62	62	64.jp2	/asm0383/image/64.jp2

Several of those sent away from here have come back Col. Buffington & family came in the Boat today, others are just outside the lines, they came across the country from Fernandina where they were landed, if nothing happens I am going to write to all the Girls this Mail, Ada writes a better letter than many Soldiers recieve or send, I shall anxiously look for the next Mail hoping to hear that you are well! My health is getting pretty good for me but the Battallion Drills are about as much as I can stand as Put has got on one of his "Double Quick" fits & it gives us fits now it has got to be hot again, I dread the 10 months summer, it is no use to think of a Furlough unless it is a case where the Dr thinks nothing else will save a man but to go North. Mrs Davis arrived today I suppose they will keep Boarders, House & Lane will board with them in the same House with Mrs Riddell Mrs R is much worried for fear Mr. R. will be hung if he is Dr Weems & Son & Mr Uzzina of this place will have to swing take care of yourself for me.

We have had quite an excitement this week not much to our credit viz Co. C. in comnd of Lt Lane went on Picket Monday Morning well Sunday morning the Guerilla Capt Dickenson with about 150 Cavalry laid a trap to take the Co that should go on picket, there is a place occupied near the picket line "just beyond," by a man named Biar there was another man stopping by with him Dickenson put then both under close arrest, so they would not carry the news of his whereabouts to the city; early monday morning he dismounted Sixty of his men, & posted them in the woods, between the picket post, & the city; then just beyond the picket line he had forty mounted men ready to charge on them ie the Co, as it marched into the clearing from the road that leads up the Beach [this clearing is the Fairbanks place the buildings have been burnt by our Soldiers] an excellent plan which would have succeeded if he had waited thirty minutes longer but the Co did not arrive till 9 oclock & Dickenson was afraid we had got wind of it & called off his men, now comes the rub I hate to write it  				asm0383000020						asm03830000200001001		81542920 Bytes	3547	7661	2082178176	RGB	8	600	asm03830000200001001.tif		2012-06-04	2012-06-04	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0383/id/144	144	146.jp2	/asm0383/image/146.jp2

The rebel attack failed but the company soldiers disbanded and fled in fear. That same day, three other companies went out on patrol and several soldiers were captured, reportedly without a fight. Shedd asks his wife not to broadcast her knowledge of these affairs as the officers are worried about the image of the regiment.		Shedd, Calvin -- Correspondence; Shedd, S. Augusta; United States.

While I have been writing Passes the Steamer has been boarded by the Pilot & Officer of Day (Capt Cotton) & is now putting up the coast most out of sight; I dont understand it, unless that the tides run so low that she could not get over the Bar. I am disapointed for I hoped this with the others would go in this Boat    Eve I was mistaken the Officer of the Day did not board the Boat; she put off before he got to her & we are at a loss to account for her actions before she was lost to view another Boat hove in sight & steamed directly South. we rather think they are Gunboats hunting & shelling Rebels on the Coast, but it is all conjecture.   				asm0383000043						asm03830000430004001		44873732 Bytes	3088	4841	2969357573	RGB	8	600	asm03830000430004001.tif		2012-06-04	2012-06-04	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0383/id/158	158	160.jp2	/asm0383/image/160.jp2

I am surprised surely that "we" carried E. at T. Meeting I take heart from that tell Esq. Smith if I had been at home he would have had one more majority.

Ada wrote that "We had good luck at Town Meeting" that was all all she said politically, she is a "Brick". Nannie wrote a very good letter I think it was written rather better than Ada,s, Ada must look out & not be behind on writing Lillys letter was very much like a letter, a little Girl here told her Father she was going to write "Says she, Father I am going to write you a letter, that you cant read" Lillie succeeds in that, but she is a "Bug" & I want to see her very much. When the Col went on board the other day & I was shaking hands with the Officers he shook my hand and said Mr Shedd I shall see you at H. Head in a few days, as I understood him, he might have said he "hoped" to as there is no doubt but he will try to have the Regt together, but as I understood him I infered that he should sent for our Co. or all the rest still in the hurry of the moment he might not have though what he was saying. but whether we leave or no, direct here till you hear we have moved certainly.

Augusta Shedd and children January 4, 1862		Shedd, Calvin (1826-1891)	http://scholar.library.miami.edu/shedd/letters/63jan04.html		Shedd writes that the regiment may move soon.  He cautions his wife to be prudent with purchases as it is uncertain when he will be paid again.  Shedd closes with descriptions of the foods available in the south.	The date Shedd wrote on the letter stated the year as 1862.  The text and the postmark on the envelope suggest the date was January 4, 1863, written from St. Augustine, Florida.

Page 1																								St. Augustine April 14, 1863     Dear Wife     I have just got off guard duty this morning a Steamer now in sight which proves to be the "Convoy" with the portion of the 7th that went to take Charleston ten thousand men marched up a hill, & then marched down again. probably you know more of the circumstances than we do. & I will not say much about it here now. the Convoy brings a very small mail none for me. the regular mail is on the Neptune which is expected this Eve, when I shall expect letters from home. I am not discouraged but I feel just like going to a "hanging" of those who are to blame for the last "fizzle." We feel that the blame lies with Hunter, but are not fully persuaded what the trouble is; the curses are loud and deep on him, it is believed that the best opportunity is lost for taking Charleston, and by reports taken over the "lines" had been led to consider the place as good as taken. we red of the swearing by the "army in Flanders" but one can hear it in the "South Army Corps." I have felt bad all the time that I could not go but I feel better about it now, and perhaps should have felt worse if I had gone.    April 15th The mail came in this morning I am in recpt of yours of the 19-23-26-&30th of March I assure you that I am very glad to hear that you are getting better. I want to see you once more if possible but it is doubtful if I do unless I live my term of service out. as things look to me we have much heavy work to do yet.    I dont know what to say about Heath so let him [     ] it is said that we shall be paid the first of May for six months & by hook or crook you must get along by begging or borrowing. 				asm0383000025						asm03830000250001001		99579552 Bytes	4891	6785	2527955710	RGB	8	600	asm03830000250001001.tif		2012-06-04	2012-06-04	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0383/id/246	246	248.jp2	/asm0383/image/248.jp2

Nannie is rather impatient at being obliged to go over to Mrs. Huses, when she is gone, but she must be kind, for perhaps she will be very glad sometime to have Louisa May with her when she is alone. I am very glad to have letters from all of them.    I dont know what to think of the Charleston affair; dont know enough to express an opinion; it looks as if it were only a cover or feint for some other opperation, so I will wait until I know more about it before blaming anyone. Give my respects to Lt Williams I would write him but the fact is there is nothing to write about in this out of the way corner of the earth. It is getting summer here the Corn is from 9 in to 3 ft high according to the time of planting Peaches large as pigeon eggs and other things equal; Cabbages Turnips Beets etc are right in their prime. I am almost convinced to come here & live for eatibles grow the year round Tomatoes with a little care in the winter can be grown& ripen at all times. A man with a Shanty and tools worth $50 is as well off here as with $1000 worth at the north ie in obtaining the necessaries of life with a gun and fishing tackle a man might live high here a year with just labor enough for exercise the only drawbacks are fleas and midges and their friends the mosquitos, to bugle for them, tomorrow we are to be mustered to see how many conscripts we need I hope we shall be filled up for it is much more pleasant to have a full Co. one feels better courage with 80 men for duty than with 28 which is all we have got in it.

I have understood that some of the "Grumbling Hunkers" have written home that the Niggers are used better than the Soldiers fed better & allowed to live in Houses &e while the Soldiers had to live out doors & many other complaints Now I should like to know if we as soldiers are so simple as to expect to live in Houses. I am mostly ashamed of them on that point, as to rations I know something about that no Negros have drawn rations except those at work for the Q.M. up to the time the men enlisted, since then the women & children have been obliged of course; while all of this time hundreds of whites were drawing rations & some of them rebels at that, some of the grumblers say that the Niggers get the best of the grub now I know that the poorest Meat & Bread, "Hard Tack", has been issued to them they draw no soft Break at all, & no clothing is issued to them till they are				asm0383000057						asm03830000570001001		79837744 Bytes	3486	7632	2612143836	RGB	8	600	asm03830000570001001.tif		2012-06-04	2012-06-04	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0383/id/250	250	252.jp2	/asm0383/image/252.jp2

Page 1																									St. Augustine Feb 13th 1863   Dear Wife & Girls     Yesterday about 10 I took my glass & went up in the Tower thinking I might see a Steamer. & I did away in the Fogg could just discern the form of one, in three hours she was at the Wharf, but no Mail, but the little black Neptune came blowing along in an hour with One, & I was very happy in the rect of yours of the 24th & 27th with those from Ada & Annah, also one from Ned & Paper & Pamphlet. I am very happy to hear that you are all comfortable in health; My health is some better, so that I have been on duty for some time. The Inspector Gen came down & today we have had a general inspection that lasted most of the A.M. Col Abbott came in the "Cosmopolitan" he has you will recollect been home recruiting, but brought none with him not even his Wife; I expected the other Rectng Officers back with him but none came. There is quite a number envy me my glass as it is the best one in the regt & the most portable. I am very glad I have got it as it will help me to see Rebels at a distance. I hope you wont think that I am afraid to see them except at a distance but it is sometimes of advantage to know where they are a leetle sooner than with the naked eye. there are rumors of a row between Hunter & Foster if the service is injured by their quarrel I hope Abe will turn them both out to shift for themselves. It makes me feel a little silly to have you praise me for my Patriotism for			asm0383000053						asm03830000530001001		80155444 Bytes	3478	7680	1705166564	RGB	8	600	asm03830000530001001.tif		2012-06-04	2012-06-04	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0383/id/264	264	266.jp2	/asm0383/image/266.jp2
Page 2																									I dont see how a man can be otherwise & be a good citizen & genuine lover of his country & its Liberties, it is simply my duty & I deserve no praise for it. if a man changes his mind in regard to the war because he suffers hardship as a soldier, he is not fit to have a country or Family unless he has got the pluck to defend them & their Liberties. I should feel a little diffident at your showing my letters to anyone except Mr Huse but he is an old & tried Friend & Patriot & I have no secrets I wish to keep from him; prehaps if I had known that he would see my letters, I should not have written in so loose a manner, as I supposed they would only come to your eye, as you know I am apt to say what I think, which I have done many times to the sorrow of us both.    Colbath our Clerk who is in N.H. recruiting, writes very despondingly; that, recruiting is played out that the Army of the Patomec is demorilised distrust their Genls & are in a bad state; and the letters from soldiers you speak of go to prove the point; also that Leut Chase is on bad terms with the Monied Men & threatens to resign. also that the present "Political Canvass" in N.H. is the most bitter he ever knew. & that everybody is downhearted & disponding; if these things are so the future looks dark indeed. the Free-Press speaks words of cheer also the Journal & Herald & Mr Gilmore; if the North has got to go down by the pressure of the Rebellion So & submissionists No. I thank God that the Republicans stand true to the "Flag & to Freedom" let them die in their Harness with their faces to the Foe. I cant believe & will not, it is too humilliating that the North has got to bow to Slavery. & end the war by compromise or acknowledging the independence of the Confederate States.   			asm0383000053						asm03830000530002001		79301776 Bytes	3449	7662	2166379421	RGB	8	600	asm03830000530002001.tif		2012-06-04	2012-06-04	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0383/id/265	265	267.jp2	/asm0383/image/267.jp2

The Col has put it to me twice to know why I had not got a Hat I have been expecting one every day for six weeks; Riddell the Sutler went to N.Y. when we were pd off, three months ago, but none of his goods have arrived; I am nearly out of patience waiting; but this is the way with everything in the Army, and what the Country is greatly lacking is this same Patience. I would write to all the Girls but have not time this mail A & A. write fine letters they have improved very much I feel very much gratified for their improvement in writing & spelling they must pay particular attention to spelling; as a badly spelled letter however perfect in other respects carries a bad look. It has been quite warm here for a week past the grass is starting up green Dec & Jan seem to be the winter months here, the buds on the Peach & Fig trees are swelling which gives evidence of the rejuveniating power of a three months rest. I notice you direct your letters to Flo it should be Fla. P.M. there has a schooner just been in sight the Fogg has shut her from sight now! the Pilot has gone out! I hope it is the Sutlers with my Hat, the Col is very particular about the uniform of his Officers, & I like to please him if I can.    We were all dissatisfied with our appearance yesterday the Col made two mistakes which is very unusual for him. then Col Abbott tried to Drill us & broke down & the Capts blundered as usual House in particulur. the men done well as they were told it is vexing to shame by Blundering Officers Lt Bennett & Uncle Dud the two lowest rank had command of the reserves of skirmishers			asm0383000053						asm03830000530003001		78784144 Bytes	3454	7601	2166410686	RGB	8	600	asm03830000530003001.tif		2012-06-04	2012-06-04	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0383/id/266	266	268.jp2	/asm0383/image/268.jp2

I have got four Oranges on one stem, as big as a cats head; I wish you could see them, but they are sour, I keep them for their good looks. I dont know what to write about tonight I will quit till tomorrow "Good Night"    Sunday Morning 15th We have just come from Inspection; it is very Foggy misty damp & dark most everyone is in bad humor, I was so long eating Breakfast that I was late to inspection, did not get there till the Regt had wheeled into Column, & opened ranks; the Col just turned round in season to see me draw sword & take my Post; being in the 1st Co, my Post is on the right chock up to the Field & Staff; but I guess he will not find fault for I am usually on time, the men are cross because they were short of Cartriges & the Capt has ordered some of them to the Gd. House but they have been told times enough to keep 40 rounds in their Boxes, they take them out they are so heavy & forget or neglect to put them in again,    I wish you would send me in a letter 2 Sewing Awls not very large & a straight one I think they call them Harness Awles one of each & a few needles one darning two for linnen & two for cotton thread more or less, these I have got are so rusty I cannot use them most of them are broken, I need a Watch extremely, I think when I am paid again I shall send for a cheap one say $12, $15, & have you pack it in a paper Box & send by mail.

He is very pleased with his new "glass" and hopes to spot some rebels with it.  He anxiously awaits the return of the sutler, as he has ordered a new hat and the colonel has commented on his lack of a full uniform.  Shedd reports that he and others are dissatisfied with their appearance, equipment, and poor drilling.		Shedd, Calvin -- Correspondence; Shedd, S. Augusta; United States. Army.
