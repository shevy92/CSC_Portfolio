We’re doing an interview with Raisa Fernandez at her home on June 1st, 1999 - OK, Raisa, when and where were your parents born; just to get an early sense of where you come from?  Raisa Fernandez: OK, well, both parents were born in Cuba.  AR: And when?  RF: Well, my father was born in - should I say the month and all that?  AR: No, you can just –  RF: He was born in 1924 in Cuba, and my mother was born also in 1925 in a little town, it’s west of Havana. It’s Bainor, it’s…very farm, you know. I’ve been there.  AR: So what were their occupations?  RF: Well, my father was a student. He lost his father when he was seventeen. And he wanted to be a pilot, but his family from his parent’s side, his uncles, basically wanted him to be a doctor because they were all doctors, most of them were doctors. And, my - his mother, my father’s mother, came from a [poorer] more poor family, unlike my father’s, were a more, you know, affluent family. So they were always against her marriage, my grandmother and my grandparents’ marriage. He was ten years older than my grandmother, so - but they fell in love and they married, you know, so - My grandfather died when he was forty-seven, my father was only seventeen, so there was always that thing, you know, so - they wanted to help my father growing up, but he wanted to be a pilot and he, they wanted him to study medicine. So, it was that. So my father was studying in a Catholic School, Los Marjitas, but he rebelled against the Catholic Church. He rebelled because he felt that, you know, he - several times he went Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  3  to the priest, the head person, you know, and asked him why people were out sleeping on the doorsteps while it was cold and raining and they couldn’t go inside the church. It was the church of, you know, it was a place for everyone to be. So he rebelled against the Catholic Church. So, where a place where he even stole from his father to give to the church, I mean money, you know, like change or whatever, he would, cause [because] - I can’t say this word in English: monagillo - almost like an assistant to the priest. So, other times he would argue why, you know, a person would have to come in through the back just because he couldn’t pay the fees for the church, you know the school. Another would come through the front door. And he rebelled. He is non- uh, non-religious, so my mother was, you know. And they married. Is that it, am I talking too much?  AR: No, no - go ahead.  RF: Oh, ‘cause [because] you asked me only where were they born, right?  AR: Well, like I said, if you want to go beyond the questions, feel free, yeah.  RF: Oh, no, but I just, you know. I don’t want to go on too much and – so  AR: Well, if you want, we can move on. Were you born in Cuba as well?  RF: Yes, I was born in Cuba. I was born in January 5th, 1954, and January 5th, I don’t know if you know, for the Latino or for the Hispanic community, is the day before Los Reyes Magos. So, I was like, kind of a gift to them. They always say that, you know. So I was born in Marianal, in ( ) in Havana. But they were married and lived in Guanabo Beach, which is a beach just east of Havana. And so, I was raised there until I was eight.  AR: And then?  Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  4  RF: And I came here - my mother came first. I have two brothers and one is older, one year older, and the other one is eleven months younger than me - than I. And, so they came first with my mother and a month and a half later my father and I were given permission to leave the country.  AR: So, how would you describe your childhood - your relationship with your mother and your father, you know - their marriage? And how do you feel that your family life impacted the way you view the world or see things?  RF: [Pause] Oh, my childhood there was, I have, I think a kind of a mental block. I only remember, um, you know, some of the time – (phone rings)  AR: So you were saying you have kind of a mental block about childhood in Cuba.  RF: Yeah, I was only eight years old in Cuba, so. You know, I remember [pause] I don’t even remember, you know. I have friends, you know, they say I was - I had crushes on this guy used to - I was only eight years old and I had crushes on this kid that lived, you know, next door, or on the other block or something, but I don’t remember. I just - I just remember, barely remember, ‘cause [because] my father was in jail in 1961 - things like that. So –  AR: For political reasons?  RF: Yeah, for political reasons -to, you know, ‘cause [because] he fought against the Batista regime and he had to flee in 1959, you know, to come here, because when he was in jail - just a couple of hours with Batista, but they told him: “OK, you’re getting out, but you have to leave the country.” So when Fidel took over - Fidel, the Revolution, you know. (knock on door)  RF: OK, so I was telling you that, you know, I was there only eight years and, I remember mostly what my parents tell me, how we were, or we enjoyed a nice, you know Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  5  - we lived in the beach in Guanabo Beach - very nice, you know, and I remember riding a lot of horses, ‘cause [because] there was a rental, you know, horses, and my father used to, you know, rent us horses. Uh, schooling I had, you know, very little because of the bombing during Batista and my parents were afraid, you know. I went to a - I think I went to public school. We weren’t very affluent, but my father, later on, got a job with - during the first years of the Revolution - he got a job with Obras Públicas in Varadero, so he was like the head, you know, of the Public Works or something like that, you know. It translated Public Works and, but before that he had to do different odd jobs because he wouldn’t sign the – [with] when Batista - he wouldn’t sign the Constitution so he had to leave the job he was with, you know, in. And, um, mostly he was involved in politics, since he was seventeen years old. You know, Cuba, you know, was in - prior to the Revolution - there was a lot of conflict, although there was some period where it was good, like my mother said that when, I think when Grau San Martín or something, she was Grauista or something like that, and they were very happy when Grau San Martín took, uh, office. And, then, after that, they were always, you know - there was always conflict, you know. And, but one of the things I know [was] that my parents never wanted to leave Cuba for any reason, like, to visit any other - Florida or visit - they wanted to - Cuba was it for them. Uh, so, um, you know my father was in jail for four months, he had a hearing - you know, a Revolutionary hearing - and so he was acquitted with the charges that he was charged with, he was, you know, set free after four months and then, there, uh, I was told he was still semi-in-hiding, you know, ‘cause [because] - and so then, they took all the papers to, to, to leave, ‘cause [because] my father thought then, if you talk to him now, it’s different, and you know, I - he thought that the best thing - cause he was offered a good position not to leave Cuba - uh, he was offered, you know, a house in Baradero, he was offered many things. My mother was offered - she was a telephone operator- and she was offered a high position, you know the president or the head - you know, the director of the Telephone Company in Havana and all that - but my father’s principles are, you know, so that he refused. And everyone in my father’s side, and his parent’s side, you know, are, you know, with Fidel, you know, revolutionary. We have doctors and all that. He was the only one, you know, besides his brother that came here before Fidel, you know he didn’t have no politics in his…blood Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  6  and my, his mother, my grandmother that immigrated to the United States, she lived in Hoboken, uh before the ‘50s, before my father got married, ‘cause [because] my, [my] grandmother came from New York to Cuba for my father’s wedding in 1950 - so and, that’s what I remember, also, my grandmother coming every summer to Guanabo from New York and visiting us and you know, going early in the morning to the beach with her - things like that. It was not a, you know, a - I don’t remember anything awful. You know what I’m saying?  AR: Yeah.  RF: Although I don’t remember playing with my brothers - I don’t remember that. There’s a block. I don’t know why there’s a block, or is it just because I was too young, or, I don’t know –  AR: So you don’t remember - um –  RF: I don’t remember enjoying, you know, playing with my brothers. I don’t remember. I’ve seen pictures, pictures I have where I see myself, you know, with my cowboy- you know – outfit and, ‘cause [because] I was kind of a tomboy. You know, raised between two boys, you know doing everything with boys and boys and so, I had my cowboy hat and my, [my], my pistols and, you know, I had a doll next door, but I had my –  AR: I would love to see those pictures.  RF: I have them. I have them. And, you know (…) this is my father’s side, and this is my mother and her old - in her town, in Campo Florido, which is like, I don’t know if you visited Cuba –  AR: No.  Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  7  RF: But I have pictures like that of me dressed like a “cobero”.  AR: You have pictures of the beach as well?  RF: Oh, Guanabo Beach! I have a lot of them. It’s all over – Oh, here’s one here. This is my house where I lived. As you can see, that’s my mother [in] one of the pictures. That’s, you know, that’s Pinta Venida which is the central part in Guanabo Beach. Pinta Venida. And –  AR: So was it the type of neighborhood where there were a lot of, a lot of - uh, I guess you said you didn’t remember, but do you at all remember a lot of people or what types of people lived in the neighborhood, or you don��t remember or have those impressions?—  RF: Just common people. Very, very ordinary. We didn’t live in any residential or anything like that. You know, there was some in the upper high that, you know, had big homes and things like that, but we had a, a small house. My father rented. And you know, on the beach, ‘cause [because] he wanted to be, you know, he liked it there for kids to be raised. That’s why I guess he, when he came, you know, he left Cuba, he came to Miami, ‘cause [because], you know, my mother said that she thought “Oh, my God! I’m here in Guanabo Beach, and you know, I have pants, and I have, you know, like a beach. And what, you know, Miami. I don’t know if I can dress with, with pants and things like that.” But when she saw it she said “Oh, I’m so glad, ‘cause [because] I’m like, it’s like Guanabo, you know. It’s kind of like Guanabo ‘cause [because] they, the beach close by and so he never wanted to move from Miami, you know. He tried going up north in New York and when he saw the people, that they wouldn’t want to talk Spanish, he said “Oh, this is not for me.” You know. “I am…” This is 1962 -63, and he tried speaking Spanish and someone said, ��Oh, no, no, no, no, don’t speak Spanish, ‘cause [because], you know, this is - It’s bad.” So, he, said, “No, no. I stay in Miami. It’s close to Cuba. It’s ---  Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  8  AR: How ‘bout - Do you remember anything about the ethnic diversity or lack of diversity in Guanabo. I would assume - Cuba’s very different from here, so I assume it was pretty integrated in terms of -  RF: No, back then it wasn’t integrated. It was mostly - You know, you had some black families, but not where I lived. I don’t think. Not like now. You know. I’ve been to Cuba, after ’79. And, uh, you know, now it’s I know there’s - it wasn’t like it is now where there could be a black family living next to you, or, normally, you know, you see black kids, ‘cause [because] I have movies from Cuba, and you can see them in school - it’s integrated. You know. I have pictures from my, from my, I think I have pictures from when I went to school and you can see all the kids and I’m not able to see any black kids. Hold on for a sec.  AR: Sure thing.  RF: Let’s see if I have the pictures right here. And I have some pictures I took from my parent’s house. And it showed ( )—my diploma – I think it’s here. I can find you more pictures but right now, you know, we don’t have much time and –  AR: Yeah.  RF: OK. This. This is me.  AR: Oh, wow.  RF: Luz Caballero-- I don’t know if it was a private school, Luz Caballero. That’s me. And that’s my oldest brother. See it says Curso ’58 -’59. ‘58-’59. You see?  AR: Wow. These are great.  Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  9  RF: Uh-hmm. So you can see the make-up. Now if you get a picture from Cuba, from a school, you can see the diversity. I can show you, I have three video - video - from Cuba, the last time I went in 19 uh, was it ’94 or ’95. One of them I took a video camera and, first time, I was, I was, well, should I do it, ‘cause [because] you know, I’ve been to Cuba from ’79 and ’79 is much different than now, you know, I wouldn’t think of - going with a video camera back in ’79. I mean- It was my first time going and things like that. But then, I just want to say, my brother says “Take it. You know, take the camera. You know, so you can, take movies.” And when I got off the plane, I took my son with me that [it] was [in] ’95. I took my son with me, my youngest son. He’d never been there. Nine years old. And when I got off the plane, I just started filming him and his grandmother came with us - his great grandmother came with us, my husband’s grandmother. That came from Mariel. My husband picked her up in Mariel - she’d never been back. So I took her. And I started filming. And then in Guanabo Beach, I wanted my son to see the school close by, and I said “Let’s go honey. Let’s go, you know, see the school.” And we were walking, and it was early in the morning and you can see in my video I was talking. I said: “Isn’t it beautiful. You know. Those kids are walking by themself [themselves].(sic) You can see little kids, you know, seven, six, eight and whatever, you know, walking by the sidewalk, some of them had their mothers with them, some of them were by themself [themselves].(sic) You know, you can seem [see] them going by themself [themselves] (sic) to school and, you know, I say “To us, here it would be, you know, we wouldn’t think of letting our kids go walking, you know. – It wasn’t far, but some of the kids, I don’t know where they lived, but, um. So I went in with a video camera, there [were] was the kids in line, and you know, they were wanting me to film them, so I asked permission, I said “Are you the director?” And she said “I’m here.” And I said “Well, you know, I’m visiting and I wanted my son to see the school and things like that, do you think that you don’t mind me filming some of the school?” And she says “Noo!” And so she took me to a third grade class and I filmed and they spoke there and everything. So you can see the diversity, you know. So. Talking back to, where you asked me whether I remember whether there were- if I had black friends and things like that - I don’t remember having any black friends. You know. Though I hear from my Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  10  parents that there was a lot of, segregation, you know. There was a private club in Havana which did not admit, and my father had black friends, and my mother had like a gay friend - and you would think of having – that was a taboo. And she, she was very nice. We have her in pictures. She passed away here. And, my mother’s sister, her husband - her boyfriend then - her husband- wouldn’t think of her - my aunt - coming to our house because my mother had that friend, you know. She was in closet. She was not out of the closet. You know what I’m saying. But they knew.  AR: Yeah.  RF: Hold on.  AR: Sure thing. (pause)  RF: So, uh, you know. My parents were more, I guess, open. Open to - you know - my father had black friends. And, you know, not a real lot of friends. But he mentioned the fact and he - since he was young - he, you know, it was his interest - you know - social. You know. He was very into the social issue, ‘cause [because] he rebelled against the Catholic Church and he rebelled against something that he, since he was young, he was in Los Marjitas, which is private, I think it was in Camagüey. He lived in Camagüey and Santa Clara. And it was not a likely thing, you know, to rebel and to - and, you know, so socially my father’s idea was, you know, that there should be the social issue in Cuba had to change –  AR: In terms of --?  RF: In terms of - everything. In terms of everything. You know. Um, I guess everything, ‘cause [because], since he was young. That’s what he believed in.  AR: What do you think made him so unique, I mean, because as you said, it’s kind of unique in that way - Is it just his personality? Is it, uh, the way – Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  11  RF: The way he was raised? I don’t know. I’m not sure. And my mother, you know, she adapted to him so well, it’s this chemistry. She was sixteen when she met him. They were in, you know, they were dating for eight years, if you want to call it dating back then. He was, I guess she was too young, you know she was sixteen and he was too much involved in politics. You know, he was very young. I don’t know. I guess during that time, the thirties, who was there…it was Machado, Batista, but, uh, I know that he - you know. So, they had this chemistry together. You can see the pictures. There are so many pictures around here, I don’t have to - and there’s no time right now, and I don’t want to take up you know, more time. But if you see him in Havana, the club - you know, like, my mother would sit and there’s a picture - I don’t know who would take all these pictures of my father and my mother - ‘cause [because] there’s so many. And I would say “You know, why are there so many pictures - beautiful pictures - and I meant to ask him. You know, “Who would take all those pictures all the time.” You know, that’s me - That’s them in Havana. So, there’s many. I cannot tell you how many. He, he. That’s them on the beach. They were married then. In Guanabo. That’s my - that’s me. That’s my mother – pregnant, and there’s [are] some other pictures there. But they have so many pictures, you know, I don’t know. I haven’t asked them, you know, “Do you take them, do you have friends- ‘cause [because] he had a lot of friends, I know that. You know he would mention that he had a lot of fights because of my mother, you know, because she, not just because she was my mother, but, she was quite beautiful. So he said sometime they would be walking, the girls in the front and them in the back and, a guy came to my mother, because my mother had beautiful long braids, and he would say Oh, ( ) “Like, oh please, if you ever cut your hair, give me a little piece of your hair.” And my father heard that and he started banging the guy, and then the friends started banging on top of each other and finally it’s like that - and so, and uh, yeah, so….  AR: OK, well, uh. Just a couple more questions about - and again I know you have very, very vague memories, but if any of this jogs something - uh about neighbors, or how you related to neighbors, or whether - yeah. Do you remember any neighbors?  RF: We had some neighbors. And some of them are here. Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  12  AR: So was it a close relationship with your neighbors would you say or was it a? ---  RF: It was mostly – It was mostly my grandmother. My grandmother on my mother’s side, she lived with us during those years from, I guess, you know, ’57 through ’62 when I left. And, you know, I was always, because my father was working in Badadero and there was always the problem, you know, with the, you know, doing things against the Batista regime, and things like that. They were in hiding and so – you know, I don’t have - you know, my memories, some of them is like, one, one three o’clock in the morning or something like that, my father and my mother we were all rushed outside, you know, the security police came and, you know, took us outside the house and, you know, my father was in his underwear and things like that. And, you know, things like that I remember. And, you know, going to - when he was jailed, you know, in 1961, and he was in La Cabana where I visited him and he said that I would just run and take things into the - you know - cell house or whatever, cell, and uh, see him, and you know. That’s -- I don’t have any. I have very vague memory, you know, from –  AR: So, it sounds like most of the - if any instability, it seems more political and um--  RF: It wasn’t - we weren’t affected that much by - you know - we weren’t affected ‘cause [because] we were protected by my grandmother. You know. And my parents, they were, you know - he was out of the house a lot of the time, and uh, we were not affected, you know. We were there so few years, you know. Uh – I was born in ’54 and uh, you know and we, I don’t know.  AR: What did you do, what did you do for, do you remember what you did for fun there? You mentioned horseback riding --  RF: Horseback riding, and playing with my brothers and going to some school that I went to - you know, and walking around I guess. And I guess –  Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  13  AR: Do you remember anything about carnivals or festivals or anything like that? Or nothing like that?  RF: No, no, no. We were not into that, because during that period of time, [it] there was not a good period for my parents.  AR: Yeah.  RF: You know what I’m saying?  AR: In terms of the –  RF: The political situation - no.  AR: The political situation, sure.  RF: [There] It was a lot of killing going on and my parents were not, you know, into any kind ( ), you know, during that time.  AR: So it was mostly home-based?  RF: Yeah, and after we were born I guess it’s, you know, raising three kids, you know, almost in two years having three kids, my mother - my father used to tell her, uh, you know, one child takes 24 hours, two and three cannot take more than 24 hours ‘cause [because] the day has only 24 hours, so, you know. That’s one thing he helped my mother in pretty much whatever he could. But, uh, now, he’s a good father, and he raised us good here. He did what he could. He was too much involved in politics here, and he didn’t gain, you know, not because he gained any - publicity, or anything, ‘cause [because] he’s not into, you know, any publicity here or anything like that - but he maintained his attitudes and his morals and, you know, and taught us - that. And at home we should speak Spanish and in school English. And, uh, that’s uh, maybe why I haven’t Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  14  lost my, uh, Spanish, although my Spanish is not very good, but, I have maintained my Spanish. I try to do the same to my kids, you know, have them speak Spanish and English and whatever other languages they want to learn. I’m not, um ---  AR: Well, that covers; I think, you know, the part, your life in Cuba, um, pretty well. You mentioned it before, but what year again, did you come to Miami?  RF: I came in the 15th, July 15th, 1962.  AR: ‘62  RF: ’62.  AR: And, um, obviously why you came would be the political situation –  RF: Well, I came because my parents - you know I came –  AR: And the move was motivated, for him, by political reasons?  RF: Oh, yes, it was, no, no economic or anything like that. It was not economic. It was political motivated. He thought that. He thinks - he thought, ‘cause [because] I don’t think, he just mentioned the other day that, you know, that, that um, that there were some mistakes and that he wouldn’t have done it—  AR: What sort of mistakes? You mentioned that earlier –  RF: Mistakes!—  AR: -That earlier that he, um, that if you talked to him now, it would be very different.  RF: Yeah, that’s what I’m saying, he, you know, he feels that his place was in Cuba. And – Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  15  AR: That he should have stayed?  RF: That he should have stayed. My parents, both of them. Not because they, they admired the Revolution, because they fought against Fidel. I mean, you know, he, but he says that they haven’t adapted here. They’re 75 and 73 and – you know, they say that they haven’t adapted, that, they all, that the only thing they think about is Cuba. You know. And, you know, they have, they thank, you know, being able to come here when they, they needed to escape, you know, ‘cause [because] they felt that, you know, we shouldn’t be raised in, uh, whatever they thought it was going to be, you know, ‘cause [because] my father was young, my father was 37 and---  [END OF TAPE 1, SIDE 1]  [TAPE 1, SIDE 2]  AR: So, yeah –  RF: So he just the other - yesterday I think or the day before yesterday he was talking to a friend of ours that came in December. He’s a doctor, his wife’s a designer and all that, and he said that he would have not left Cuba. And I mean, he was, that he was stupid. It was stupid because he should have stayed there and he thought ---  AR: --Was it thinking about Cuba or was it like the way it was here?  RF: No, it was – the way things, the outcome of Cuba. You know, the outcome, that he sees, is not, you know, some things are not good, but other things are good. And, he says that, I guess, other than you were being, you know, I don’t know. It’s just that he thinks we would be better off being raised in Cuba, as Cubans. It sounds stupid or not?  AR: No.  RF: And – Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  16  AR: I’m actually really curious to know maybe if he --  RF: There’s a lot of people, there’s a lot of people who think like that now.  AR: Yeah.  RF: Older Cubans, that think differently about, you know, what the Revolution meant to them then and means to them now. And they’re not interested in [anything] nothing. I mean, they’re not, like, you know, it’s not that they’re Fidelistas. You know what I’m saying. They’re not.  AR: Yeah.  RF: ‘cause [because] my father is not a “Fidelista”. But I know that he has mentioned the fact that, it’s better off - Cuba - with Fidel, than with the United States.  AR: Right.  RF: I don’t know if you understand.  AR: I think I do. I think I do. Well, um—  RF: There’s [are] a lot of things. There’s [are] a lot of heavy - things - when he says that.  AR: Yeah.  RF: ‘cause [because] I –  AR: Well, no, as I say. I think I understand in general principles, but could you elaborate on that, or on, specifically what - you know, you mention that he says some Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  17  things are good and some things are bad – well what is good and what is bad and how does America enter into?---  RF: Well, you would have to talk to him.  AR: Yeah.  RF: ‘cause [because] I’m not inside his mind. Although I was raised here with a lot of politicians, you know, like old, you know like his, you know, people that came from Cuba and we had, they had meetings, constantly in my home. So I was raised in that atmosphere of politicians. That’s why maybe I have such a, you know, stand for being active and things like that, but you would have to talk to him. I mean, the only thing I could imagine when he says those things, you know, that he has changed his, you know, his attitude and his, way of thinking, you know. And things that [have] has happened here in Miami, in reference to Cuba and how people perceived and how people, like some Cubans, um – maintained their position in favor of the embargo and how people do not see more than what actually Fidel, you know, I guess, what Fidel has done for Cuba. In a way --- I don’t know if you understand. Uh—you know. I do not - I do not blame anyone for me being here. You know. There was a period of history a [period] - you know history, and history, you know, was made. And some people lost, some people gained. You know. Some people lost things, but other people gained. People that were not, had anything, gained something. That’s what I’m saying.  AR: Yeah.  RF: And, you know, when like, I talk to some family members over there, that were very poor and he says, “Well, let me tell you. I’m not a Communist, but back then, uh, a pound of coffee cost five cents and I couldn’t afford it. Now, it costs ten, ten pesos and I can afford it.” So, to some, to a lot of people, it gave them something. And those few that had so much, they lost, but I think some of them gained a lot here also. You know. Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  18  So –you know, my pa - my parents didn’t have anything over there. They only had their, you know, what they felt was right, and here –  [TAPE BREAKS OFF MOMENTARILY]  AR: So you were talking about their experiences.  RF: Yeah, and, you know, we do talk, my father and I about things, ‘cause [because], I’ve been, since I was young, I was introduced to a lot of politics and things like that, and then, you know, I , my issues are for people to have, you know, everyone to have things and enjoy things here, so I’m involved a lot with that and – but, as I say, again, if you want to know things like that, you would have to talk to him. He would have a lot more to say that I ---  AR: I would love to talk to him. He sounds like a fascinating person.  RF: No, he is - he is. He is. And though now he’s – my mother’s not well and he just turned 75, so, you know. He’s doing pretty good [well]. But again, you would have to talk to him. And I could ask him about it.  AR: That would be great. Well, um, I guess now, let’s move to Miami and talk about, you know, we talked about your childhood and the neighborhood as you remember it, you know, in Cuba. What was it like growing up in Miami? I guess I’ll ask you first, where did you live when you came to Miami, and how would you say that differed, [how] that neighborhood was different from the one you were raised in Cuba?  RF: I lived in Miami. I came here with my father---  AR: Where in Miami?  RF: In, uh, what is now I-95. Ninth Street and Third Avenue. Right there on I-95. My mother was living there in an old apartment full of roaches and things like that. My father was kind of ill ‘cause [because] in the jail - in La Cabana - he had like um, some Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  19  things that he developed, some - infection. It was an infection and he redeveloped it here a little bit. But they cured it and he was well. But he wanted to leave that apartment, ‘cause [because] it was pretty bad and so we moved to 6th Street and 14th Avenue, always in Little Havana. What is now Little Havana, back then it wasn’t called Little Havana. Of course not, ‘cause [because] we had a lot of Anglo friends and you know, when I went to school in Shenandoah that was full of Anglos. I have my yearbook from 1968 and uh, so we were there - three kids - seven, eight, and nine, and my father and my mother. And his mother was in New York, in Hoboken. His brother was in Hoboken. And you know, we didn’t have that, that relationship. You know, we loved our grandmother, but I just remember her sending some stuff from Hoboken and, then we lived there. It was a very tight room and I remember, my mother used to go to the factory to work with my father and we had the chicken pox. And we were alone, and my mother used to call on the public phone, like in the sidewalk, and we used to run and say “OK, we’re OK and we have no fever.” Whatever, basically being by ourselves. So, uh, then we moved to what is now more of a black area which 87th Street and 23rd Avenue. Back then it wasn’t, you know, black. I mean black people were further north or something like that, I don’t remember. And we lived there…and we lived there for a year, and basically, you know –  AR: How was it, how was life different would you say from what you remember in Cuba in terms of the neighborhood, uhm --?  RF: It was, you know, a lot of English-speaking, you know, and—  AR: How did you relate with them, with the Anglo community?  RF: I don’t remember… I remember one thing that I remember, never left my mind, to see how bad it is when things happen when you’re little – I was in West Little River, 1962. I know this because, it was, you know they say you remember when John F. Kennedy was shot, so I was in West Little River in November of 1962 - was it, did he die ---  AR: ‘63 Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  20  RF: Three - ’63, I’m sorry. And I remember, you know, being there and, and sometimes the teacher would say “You can’t speak Spanish. You can’t speak Spanish.” If you speak Spanish, they would take your, like, your snack away or something from you. I don’t know if it was racially motivated or, uh, I don’t remember…. I just don’t remember that part - you know, right now you see kids they go to special classes for Spanish, and you know, whatever, but back then, it was hard, it was, I remember that I couldn’t get ice cream because I think I spoke Spanish once. That’s the only thing, the only language I knew - Spanish. So that’s what I remember. And then we moved back to Little Havana - 21st and 8th Street - between 8th and 9th and we lived there. And then –  AR: Well, the ’63 incident, what was - you said you remembered—  RF: I remember that there ‘cause [because] I was there and I remember people stopping because Kennedy was shot, and I remember - and I remember something that my father said- ‘cause [because] he said that a lot of Cubans celebrated the death of Kennedy and he didn’t, ‘cause [because] he thought Kennedy was, you know, good and, you know, there was some, misconception about what happened - the Bay of Pigs and things like that, and they, and Kennedy blamed himself for what happened. Things like that, you know, and so, he, I remember what he mentioned, that a lot of Cubans celebrated the death of Kennedy and, you know, it was a solemn day and, for him too, you know. For us, you know, ‘cause [because] he was the president and being shot and things like that. So I remember, you know, people stopping in the hall and --- you know…  AR: And those incidents you mentioned about, you know, you remember being denied things for speaking Spanish or being punished…  RF: Yeah, I remember that –  AR: How did that make you feel as a kid [?]---  Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  21  RF: Bad - It made me feel bad –  AR: And um –  RF: And I was like, OK, something else. I was put into - I was eight or, eight years old or nine years old and I put into second grade, and I was bigger than the other kids. I felt bad. I was bigger and so, --- You know, so that’s what I remember. And then we came to - then I started Shenandoah Elementary and it was pretty nice. I enjoyed it. You know. And I started having friends. My mother, um, in 1965, my mother said to my father : “Let’s do something so we can have more time with the kids ‘cause [because] they’re small.” And they would work in a factory and things like that, so my mother said “OK, I want to start picking up kids.” So they started a little station wagon they had. She started. And, after that, they got a van…and they get a bus…and they started transporting kids here and my father did Riverside, the inter- integration - it was started in 196- ’72, something like that—  AR: Oh, so the bussing of kids –  RF: The bussing of kids from Overtown, to Little - to the white neighborhoods. So integration started in 1971-72 here, at Riverside and Douglas Elementary. So he worked there in that area.  AR: How was that - How did he – Well, has he ever told you any of his observations in terms of that whole era of, you know, bussing and, you know, uh --  RF: No, well, he said, you know, about integration –  AR: Any incidents?  RF: I haven’t, because I do the transportation now in Riverside and Douglas and Booker T. Washing- and I can see there’s [are] still conflicts and, you know. They try to do something that they think it was good, but, uh, they left neighborhoods unattended, Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  22  you know, they left the black neighborhoods unattended and, uh. Oh, he mentioned that, he mentioned that, you know, that, what I know is like, those black, you know the schools in the black area when we came 1962- ’63, whatever, those schools were very, unattended. They had no books. They had little books or raggedy books. And um, and, and, you know, he remembers an incident when he came in Cu- in Miami, where he went into a bus - 1962 - a bus, and it was still here, you could see the, in Miami Beach, you could see the water fountains that was Black and White, you know, bathroom, you know about those. And he remembers going to the bus and sitting down and then a pregnant black lady comes in and he offers her his seat, and everybody starts looking at him and she said “No, no, no, no.” She tells my father, “No, I don’t want your seat.” My father says “Yes, yes.” My father, you know, literally took her in and set her. And everyone looked at my father like “What are you doing, you know. She’s a black, you know, they have to go to the back - and they cannot sit.” So, that’s. I remember that was an impact to my father. That was something that, although it happened in Cuba, but, as again, he was different. He was, you know, he had black friends, my mother [had] a friend, or girlfriend, that was - gay. You know, she was not out of the closet as you call it now, but everyone knew that this lady was gay. And you couldn’t- you couldn’t be around, but she was a very good lady. She loved us. You know, there’s [are] pictures there with her, and everything like that. So, um. You know. I guess they were different in that way. And they were different. And my father’s views to social issues are different. You know. He feels that everyone, you know, people, you know, should be - they should live in a land, they should work the land and that the land should be theirs and, whatever, you know. Things like that. Issues. Social issues that, you know, medicine, health, housing, you know, education, you know he favors those things to be guaranteed of life for everyone. So, I guess he’s different that way…as a Cuban. – But, no, there’s [are] a lot of Cubans that feel like that - not only him. There’s a lot that do feel like that. And they’re here in Miami.  AR: Well, um - OK. Alright, so we talked about, a little bit about your experience –  RF: Excuse me. Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  23  AR: Sure. Sure, of course.  RF: I remember I have something – Do you want to drink something?  [TAPE BREAKS OFF]  AR: Well, um, again, I asked you this about Cuba, but then in Miami, throughout your childhood, what did you do for fun, specifically, then – Well, I’ll ask that generally of course.  RF: Fun?  AR: Yeah, what did you guys - did you guys?—  RF: We went to the beach - to Miami South Beach –  AR: And what was that like? What were your impressions of going to the beach here in Miami?  RF: When I was small?  AR: Yeah, throughout your childhood.  RF: It was good. I mean, we went to the beach. And, what we had for fun, I guess, my father would put us in the car and we would take a ride through Collins and Ocean Drive -- well, Collins, I don’t know if it was there then. And to 163rd and come back and that was his -- he didn’t do any going to the movies or anything. My father and my mother, he says he couldn’t do this because he left a lot of friends behind in jail, whatever, and he wasn’t going to be having fun here while his, you know, his people [were] was there - you, the people that he left in jail, whatever. And, he didn’t think of - you know - just - Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  24  he went to the beach ‘cause [because] we were raised on the beach and we had to go to the beach. I mean, you know –  AR: Was it basically an event - you going to the beach - that you would - that was a family activity?  RF: Yeah, a family activity. You know, go there - family activity -Maybe once we went to the Keys together - um. It was hard to get my father out of Miami - out of, you know, his things that he would do.  AR: How ‘bout [about] visiting parks as a child. I mean, did you guys do that at all?  RF: Yeah, we went on our own. We went to the park. I guess - to Shenandoah. There was [were] not many parks - there was [were] not many parks around here. You know. It was just a school park - the playground. Which now I noted they have some signs throughout some of the schools that if you cut inside of the playground you’re in violation of being arrested. I mean, what is that? You know, this is a school playground. That’s one of the only playgrounds that kids have around here and they have posted - actually there’s a law - that that is private property, even though that’s a public school - it’s private property. And I could see, not doing harm to the school or something, but, you know, the playground after school should be open to everyone. I mean - but there’s [are] signs if you go through Coral Way Elementary, right here, you see the signs. And I was thinking of maybe getting in touch with someone who might do an article on that or do an investigation or something – But that’s something else. OK, so um, no, we went to, when I was growing up, then, you know, we would go to Fair Island, Coconut Grove, it was vacant, you know - now it’s like big buildings and things. You know we would go there and jump the fence and go swimming or go to other – you know, horseback riding, or something like that.  AR: Again, mostly family activities or did you –  Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  25  RF: No, then later on, later on by ourselves, you know, with my brother or friends and things like that.  AR: Living in Little Havana, in those years, in your childhood, and teen years, what – well, how did you relate to neighbors here in Miami? Was there a strong sense of community would you say, or—  RF: There was more.  AR: More than now you mean?  RF: Yeah, I had a - I had, you know, like, I had like an Anglo, like friends, you know. And I had a girlfriend I remember, you know. It was somewhat. You know. Not too much, but you know. I related to them, you know, growing up, maybe I was eleven, twelve - She was the first one to show me to eat clam chowder - New England clam chowder - She used to love it. So, I remember, she lived across the street with her grandmother. And she moved away – and then we were starting - you know, I can show you my yearbook in ’68 at Shenandoah; it was mostly, you know, Anglo. You know. Everything was Anglo. And you notice - year by year you started seeing everybody leaving - you know, those friends that you grew up with, you know, leaving, you know.  AR: Did you get a sense of the resentment because it was a growing Hispanic population, or was it just something that happened?  RF: Something that happened I guess. I guess - the Cu- it’s sad to say, but some of the Cubans, you know, they felt that this was theirs, or something. You know. They led [other people to believe] to believe other people that, you know “we’re here and this is ours, and you know, we’re not going to,” I guess - I don’t know. You know, looking [back at things] things back and hearing things that [have] has happened now, where you see some Cubans saying “Well, we made Miami, we are - you know, we have all the politicians heading everything.” You know. And I think, it would be resented, you know Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  26  from the whites, you know, and the Anglo if they did it, if they do it now. Back then I guess, it was, I guess, like that also. And things that happen in Miami constantly, you know the bombings and things like that. You know, that’s what I remember my father saying, you know. You can’t talk, you know. You can’t really talk [about] your ideas –  AR: In Miami?  RF: Yeah. And, you know - like - um - (PAUSE) and you know, sometimes I think - it was hard, ‘cause [because] you, you know, you spoke something, you could have been bombed.  AR: Bombed by –  RF: Bombed by – people who disagree with your ideas. And it was very hard. And it was like, you knew that no one - that the authorities - they weren’t doing anything about it. It was really ---  AR: And who was doing the bombing? You say people that ---  RF: You know, people – You know, I don’t know. They felt that they had the right to do what they wanted to do, and that’s how it was, and if you didn’t think how they think, then you could be threatened.  AR: So Cuban groups?  RF: Yeah.  AR: Cuban groups.  RF: Yeah. Cuban. And, so.  Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  27  AR: Would you consider this - somewhat of a change - a safe neighborhood to be in, to walk in?  RF: This one?  AR: Little Havana in general, or the areas where you lived.  RF: Now?  AR: Then and now.  RF: It was very safe. I remember. It was pretty safe, ‘cause [because] I remember what my father enjoyed most of all to you know. (ANSWERS PHONE)  RF: I was telling you that here and where I lived around in Little Havana, I remember that my father enjoyed sitting outside, lying in the grass and just looking at the stars - star-gazing, as you call it now. It was like midnight and he’d look and he bought this beautiful radio - that was like, what, ’69, ’68. He bought a big German radio - his friend had a company and he sold us this radio - and we would hear music and go star-gazing and all that. But later on, I remember that we were outside, late at night, and he heard like footprints or something like that. And he followed them and he thought it was someone like an intruder or something, so we stopped – we lessened the hours of the evening that we would stay outside. We used to be able to leave the door open, the keys in the car, and things like that, but later –  AR: Later when?  RF: I think it was like ’68, ’69 around that area - time. I remember he had a van stolen from 16th Avenue where we lived.  AR: Were there any other incidents - I mean any increase of – Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  28  RF: Yeah, it was increasing.  AR: Any other specific incidents?  RF: Well, he was broke - someone came into the house where he lived. They slept upstairs and someone did come in through the house, and also in the back, in the garage door they came in. That was like, that was a couple years ago. But other than that, nothing ever happened to me. Only once when I was little a man that asked me for an address, I remember, and when I came close to the car I remember he was kind of exposing himself. So I just ran, ran to my house, you know, scared, scared, so you know, and told my mom and things like that. But other than that, you know. Then people started putting the security bars in the windows and it was a different time.  AR: So how long have you lived here?  RF: In where?  AR: This neighborhood I guess.  RF: This is, like The Roads you mean? Since 1984. So, really, basically it’s close-by where I lived, ‘cause [because] I just lived right - a couple blocks from here. I lived from 14th Avenue to 16th Avenue from 1965 through 1976 when I got married, you know. There my parents lived for twenty-four years in that house. It was always rented. He never bought. He had a chance to buy, he said he never thought of buying ‘cause [because], first of all, he had three kids, teenagers, spending a lot of money. He worked to give us what, you know, everything that we asked for as teenagers: having a car, not like a new car, but he always got us a car, insurance, this and that. He always provided for us. But he had a chance to buy maybe one house, or something like that, and he - his mind was not into buying any property - and now he tells me, he regrets. It was an error that he made, that he didn’t buy a house, at least a house, where he could have a comfortable place to live now. Now he lives in a one-bedroom apartment, you know. Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  29  And – so he tells me and he tells my brother - don’t sell your house. Even if it’s big now for you, whatever, keep it. You have a nice house to live in and, you know, ‘cause [because] one of the things he says here, “You have to have a place to live. You have to have, you know, when you retire, those retiring years are very difficult, and if you’re not comfortable, if you don’t have money, it’s very hard years.” Very hard. A lot of people, Cuban, elderly, that’s all they think about - going back to Cuba, ‘cause [because] they think in Cuba they’re going to live better their last years. Maybe some of them are [right] true.  AR: How would you describe this neighborhood?  RF: It’s fairly nice, although neighbors – I couldn’t say good things about all the neighbors that are around here. You know, they, they couldn’t care less. Like I have a neighbor here - right here. She has two little kids. She’s very nice. Very nice. Um, but other than that you can’t count on your neighbors. Like you hear old people saying “In Cuba, you know, you can ask for a cup of sugar.” It was more of a – family thing. But here - you know. I guess it’s - you could ask for a favor, but maybe they wouldn’t like it or something.  AR: Have you had any experiences like that? Personal experiences like that?  RF: Yeah. We lived a couple of houses away, we bought that house in ’91 or something, and my husband had to put it for sale ‘cause [because] the neighbor next door was -well- they kept to themself (sic) [themselves] but - my husband had a boat, back then they called inspectors and you had to leave, had to take your boat out of the yard. And now I see a lot of boats in the neighborhood. You know, they have them in front of the houses, and they’re able to keep them there. But he says, my husband says, “But listen, it happened two or three times and instead of coming to ---  [END OF TAPE 1, SIDE 2]  Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  30  [TAPE 2, SIDE 1]  RF: OK. Instead of having a worse argument - because my husband has a temper - he’s very good and whatever, but when they do something like (ANSWERS PHONE) so we put that house for sale, and this was available because the owner had died and the house was vacant, so we got a chance and we got this house. And you know, he loved being around ‘cause [because] it’s close to the beach, it’s close to our parents - his parents live right in Little Havana, my parents live in Little Havana. We have our jobs here, ‘cause [because] we have our bus routes in Little Havana and Overtown and he wouldn’t think of moving past, I don’t know - 27th Avenue. So, my brothers lived here but they moved to Kendall and all that. I was the only one who stayed in this area because my husband made - basically he wanted to be close to his jobs, he doesn’t like driving. Now he drives to Broward, ‘cause [because] he got a job in Broward. So now he drives to Broward. But he likes it. But it’s not too much traffic, ‘cause [because] the traffic is going that way, you know, at night, he’s coming, so there’s not traffic. He hates the traffic. He hates it. But I like the neighborhood. All of them - the neighbors - you know, neighbor means - I don’t know what neighbor means. Neighbor means people, having people when you need to count on them and you know their names. If you need something, you think you can go there and count on those people.  AR: And can you?  RF: Some of them yes. But again, they’re inside, they’re busy working and going to school and raising kids and they have too many problems, you know. They’re working to live, to be able to pay all their many expenses and things like that. I guess we can’t blame them for a way of life.  AR: What would you say have been the biggest changes in this neighborhood since you’ve lived here?  RF: More kids.  Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  31  AR: More kids.  RF: Yeah! More kids. We have more kids. We used to not have a lot of kids in this neighborhood. There’s [are] more people - younger people moving in and having kids. This is a neighborhood that has many years. I know a lady across the street she was the first police officer in the city of Miami, and now she’s in her eighties. And she used to have - she has a gun. And I thought when we used to talk, and at the beginning when I moved here in 1984, and at the other house. She used to be mad. And then, after I know [knew] her, that’s the way she spoke. She’s Anglo. But she liked us. She liked us very much, and she used to criticize, there were some neighbors that moved into the house next door and the lady bought it, she worked at Jackson, but she’s got a boyfriend who used to play the drums, and she used to say, “Raisa, don’t you hear that person so loud playing drums?” And I’d say “I don’t know, he’s on the other side of the house. I don’t.” (laughing) I remember her saying that. So she moved away and there’s another couple here now. But more kids in the neighborhood, ‘cause [because] when my daughters moved in they were small and there was hardly anyone. The lady next door was single, and the people next door I think had some kids, yeah, but they moved away. And they were a little bit bigger than my kids, so then we had ( ). The lady next year bought, she’s the mother of two year-old twins, and the lady next door has three kids, small kids, you know, and in the back there’s (there are) kids. You know, there’s [they are] kids!  AR: So do you think people are moving here to raise kids because it’s a good place to raise kids?  RF: I guess. Yeah. Yeah.  AR: Well, what makes it that? What makes it good to raise kids, would you say?  Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  32  RF: The area I guess. You know, a lot of other people moved in because their jobs are closer and, you know. There’s [There are] a lot of police officers - you know, they live around this area also.  AR: Is there a station nearby?  RF: Well, the city of Miami police station is right there on Second Avenue. And a couple of years ago they had a law or a regulation, ordinance, that people who started working for the city of Miami have to live in the city of Miami. So I guess that’s why a lot of them - there’s a lot of police presence. You can see a lot of police vehicles around here.  AR: I asked you about this earlier - Is it safe to walk in this neighborhood now? At night, or at all hours?  RF: You always have to think about - during the night - to go out during the night. You know, we have had entry into the house. We’ve had entry into vehicles.  AR: In recent years?  RF: Yes.  AR: Often, or just once or –  RF: No, we had it once - entry into the house. We were not here then. Well, we lived in the house, but it was early in the morning and we had just left for work and school. And once before we moved in, we caught a person inside the house before it was - it was vacant - but we caught the person. ‘Cause [because] we’re - you know, we’re neighbors that come out - you don’t see a lot of neighbors out, you know, sitting down and talking and - they’re very busy lives. You don’t see them. It’s hard to see someone coming out. These kids next door - the other day I saw them. I hadn’t seen them for months, and they’re small kids. And I said “Oh, wow, they’re out.” I guess they’re building also in Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  33  the back and it’s very bad for them. They’re building and expanding a pool and things and she hates having to come to that mess. So she stays a lot with her mother that lives close-by. Her mother bought it. I talk a lot to her - to her mother, you know. She’s a very nice lady.  AR: What neighborhood organizations are there? And if there are any are you a member of any?  RF: Yeah, they have the Roads Association – R-D-S Association. And the past president is now a commissioner of the city of Miami, Joe Sanchez, he was a past president of the Roads Association. But I don’t know – They have a flier, I have it around here. And my phone is ringing again, I’m sorry.  AR: Oh, no, no. That’s OK. Go ahead, I’ll pause it again.  (PAUSE)  AR: Oh, yeah, I was asking - you mentioned the Roads Association - And what sort of issues do they address?  RF: Oh, they have different issues - they have an issue right now going on with the air traffic and also the museum - a museum is going to be built at the Vizcaya Station, the Metro Station that is there. They plan to move it - move the station or something, because they want to build like a museum or something there.  AR: The museum of what? Do you know?  RF: Youth museum or something, I’m not sure. I have a brochure from the Roads Association – I have it somewhere. I was looking at it the other day. But they have also, if you have a complaint - if you see something wrong going on in the neighborhood, to call them and things like that. They address different issues. I think they were planning to build a low-income housing close-by or something there, on 12th Avenue at the Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  34  intersection and I think they didn’t want that, so they came together and stopped the building of that. They’re very active - they’re very strong. I think they’re very influential. I think they have the Brickell-Roads Association or something like that.  AR: Would you say it’s a positive influence?  RF: Um, I don’t know. I think so. In a way - if the issues are good and - I don’t know.  AR: Well, you mentioned, um, that you had break-ins here and stuff. Were there other types of crime or problems of that sort? Are there youth gangs that operate in the area?  RF: Not really. No, not really. You never know what happens - you know, what kids do. Maybe they’re in their house and they’re doing things and they’re not actually, quote and unquote, youth gang, but they might be up to something, you know - Who knows? You know, whatever happened over there in Colorado those are, you know, a pretty good neighborhood area, and look what happened -two kids got - just did things - you don’t know. And they say, there’s no crime - Well, you don’t know what your neighbor’s doing. And that could be a crime - they could be doing something…you don’t know. A couple a years ago there was a bust a couple of blocks away and it was drugs I think - you don’t know. OK, you don’t see gangs, or you don’t see other things, but - you don’t know if someone is doing illegal things.  AR: You bring up - there was possibly a drug bust--  RF: - Bust a couple of years ago.  AR: Would you say drugs are a big problem in this neighborhood or not a problem in relation to or in comparison to –  RF: No, it’s not a problem that they’re out there selling drugs or anything - like I see in Little Havana - ‘cause [because] I see it every single day. It’s not that kind of a problem. Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  35  But you don’t know. I hope, you know, we have neighbors who are not doing that – that are doing good [well]. You know, a block away, there was a famous - the owner of that house, I don’t want to say his name –  AR: OK, fair enough – But you say in Little Havana you see it all the time.  RF: Oh, yes, I see it so bad –  AR: And is that --  RF: Sí, sí, sí, sí, sí. A pia en noche tía ( ) yo pienso. I’m sorry I had to talk Spanish  AR: That’s OK.  RF: I think, you know, I’m driving those kids to their homes and I see the lady doing crack and I’m saying “My God, these kids what are they going - what are they seeing - every single day, what are they seeing? What are they going to be doing?” And I see the kids like you know, I was going to mention. You know, I have one kid now that a mother called me last week and said “Raisa, you know, my son is going to - outside detention - expelled, for ten days.” And I asked her what happened and she said, “He was throwing food in the cafeteria with fifteen others who are also expelled for ten days and you know this is the last of the school year and they’re doing tests.” And I said, “Well, did you talk to the principal.” She said: “You know, he didn’t even want to hear it.” And I said: “Well, go to the regional office and say that you, that if you put him inside suspension - but ten days for throwing food.” I know that that shouldn’t happen, but there’s other things that are worse than throwing food and then suspending a kid where a mother has to leave and go to work and leave the child by himself - twelve years old, thirteen years old. I don’t know how old is he - yeah, thirteen. What are you going to gain by suspending a child ten days out of a school system? Are you awarding or are you punishing? What are you doing? If you don’t have an alternative program to teach - you’re suspending a child for throwing food and you’re suspending him for ten days. Then the child who doesn’t want to go to school is who’s going to be doing things to get Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  36  suspended. So what is the punishment? So I told the mother: “No, you go to the regional office and say that you want to protest this; that you want to have your child inside the school.” But I don’t know. There’s a lot of that going on, especially Booker T. Washington. I don’t know other schools, if they’re having the same. It would be interesting to note, or to learn, if other schools - you know, if that’s happening, because those kids are going to be the future - those kids are going to be in trouble. And instead of getting resources to do prevention and intervention like we argue for, it’s not happening. You know, you have kids ten years-old, eleven years-old doing, being truancy (sic.), doing things - I know them. I know them ‘cause [because] they’ve been in my bus and I had to tell the mother, “Listen, I’m sorry I tried.” You know, I refer them to organizations that are in Little Havana. What are they doing? What are they doing? They get millions of dollars in grants in Little Havana, and what are they doing? I don’t know. Because kids are supposed to be - when they finish the school year - parents are worried - where am I going to put my kids? Where are they going to go? Are they [were] going to be in the house doing what - seeing (sic) T.V. doing nothing? ‘Cause [because] there’s nothing - there’s no programs. And what little programs there are there’s a lot of fee - you have to pay, and not all the kids can fit into that program.  AR: What would you like to see in terms of addressing those needs?  RF: What do you mean?  AR: You know, you say there aren’t programs, there aren’t things - and when there are programs they’re too expensive, what –  RF: I think I would want to see the people who are representing us, or who are - in charge of the programs, being more active, bringing more programs into the area for parents that cannot afford to send their kids to Miami Museum of Science and pay $200 for a program for a week. You know, we can’t afford that. Or bringing more programs. Because you’re going to end up - if you think you’re saving money right now because you’re not bringing those programs in, you’re going to be spending more money in the Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  37  end because those kids are going to be in trouble, they’re going to go into juvenile, they’re going to go into hearings and it’s going to cost the state and the city more money than having programs. I know that ‘cause [because] I study that - I was involved in the - the foundation that brought a grant to Little Havana. It was awarded back a couple of years ago - The Anna Casey Foundation awarded money to Little Havana. But what happened? The bureaucracy - the money doesn’t come directly to the people. It doesn’t come here. It goes to higher ups. And then they’ll decide what to do with that money - First I got to get my salary which is $90,000 a year, my other expenses, then we’ll see what happens with the rest of the money. You know. And so that’s what happens. And that’s why you have kids and then you have “Oh, because they’re making problems.” OK, keep the pool all-year-round, so the kids can enjoy it and instruct them to do swimming not in summer, because in summer they’re [they] already wanting to go to beach. Do it before summer, and do classes and do things. And there’s [are] programs out there - like the YMCA, things like that, that would want to bring programs in, but they don’t have the funds. And the city – and, oh, there’s conflicts: Metro-Dade with the City of Miami and the YMCA and the Boys Club - and they have conflict –  AR: Political conflicts?  RF: Not political, but, uh, I was going to say another word and you mentioned political. - no, it’s more of a “Who’s the best.” They don’t work together. They don’t bring their resources together, to see, you know, to bring more programs into the area. Because they want to compete, it’s a competition: Who does a better program, who gets more money. You know what I’m saying. And they end up hurting the people that they’re supposed to serve. The kids, the families, and the elderly, and things like that. So, sometimes, that’s why you see people that they don’t want to get involved. They don’t want to get involved. I am so tired sometimes, and I think, “Why should I get involved?” But then I see that I have kids and I have kids that I’m responsible to, the kids that I transport. I’m not just a bus driver to them. We’re a friend, you know, someone that they’ll talk to. And they’ll say things that amaze you. –  Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  38  AR: Things like what?  RF: Oh, I have things where kids tell me, “My mother’s seeing another man.” And things that they will talk about, little kids will talk to you about. And, you know. I have one girl right now, who - her father doesn’t visit her, she lives with her mother, her mother’s trying to send her to tennis classes and she’s poor - she works in a Cuban family in Hialeah - and when I met her first, she said, “Do you know somewhere that my mother can work?” And I said “Well, your mother’s working.” And she said: “Yeah, but those people over there are bad to my mother. They talk bad to her, you know, and yell.” I said: “Well, we’ll see what we can do.” Things like that that kids talk to you about and you’re supposed to listen and not say anything - and try and see if things work out. But you know that a lot of those kids -they’re not going to work out. And they’re going to have problems. And I have a kid right now that, he doesn’t have a bus that will take him because he’s been so awful in the past. And he’s young. He’s - now he’s twelve - he spoke to me the other day ‘cause [because] we were going to do a field trip to Disney World and he said: “Right now my mother might let me go.” And I said: “Well, we’re not going to go ‘cause [because] I have my mother in the hospital and we don’t have that many kids” - ‘cause [because] they’re poor families, you know. And even I have a bus that’s not working and my husband’s been after me that we can do a library with this bus - we just paint it up - there was an article about a teacher who brought buses - traveling libraries - classrooms, somewhere up north - so my husband wanted to do this - paint the bus, take the seats. Put books, put things and just travel around Little Havana and maybe have - ‘cause [because] he thinks that there could be a grant that we could have teacher in the bus and have tutoring -’cause [because] there’s not that many things that kids have after they finish school. There’s not [aren’t] a lot of programs. You know. And a lot of the parents - they don’t know English, and they don’t know how to help the kids with the homework. And so, everyday I’m trying to - I tell him “OK, there’s a Dial-A-Teacher, the library has a program - Shenandoah has a program on Saturdays.” You know, I bring the brochures and give it to the school so the principal can give it out - things like that. That I can help a little bit with that. But it’s too many. There’s a lot of need and I see that the system is sometimes not working. Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  39  AR: Do you see any hope? Any direction that could be - that maybe should be stressed more or is it – Do you see a way out basically?  RF: I don’t know. It’s (PAUSE) I don��t know. I see that the problem is so, so bad especially in this area. I know that there’s [are] a lot of areas in the whole country that is worse than this, I think, but it could be - there might be a solution, but really you have to have - there has to be more participation with people that are in charge of getting programs into the communities. They have to - something’s happening there that - waste of funds, you know, corruption, it’s a lot of corruption. People being arrested for mismanaging money and you know, giving contracts where they shouldn’t be given. Things like that, where the money is not going where it is appropriated to go. And we’re so far away from where some of the monies are coming from. (PAUSE) I don’t know. There’s [are] a lot of problems - socially. Socially there’s [are] a lot of problems. I don’t know what it is. Parents blame themselves sometimes or blame - mostly themselves for not raising a kid that’s correct or whatever, but you see that sometimes it’s not the parents’ fault. There’s [are] many things in society.  AR: Have your kids strayed away from most of that - most of the problems?  RF: Yeah, a lot of them - yeah, but they’re young, they’re going to school and things like that, but you always worry. I have a thirteen year-old and I worry about him. My father says: “You have to worry, these years are very critical.” You know, drugs, gangs, you know because if they don’t find it in the home, they try to get it with other things out there. You have to be with them constantly, constantly. So with my son, he’s thirteen years old and I’m trying to take him to places he wants to go. You know, not spending money, but going fishing or going places that I think that it would be better for him than just being inside the house or looking (sic.) at T.V. or whatever.  AR: So like what? What does he do for recreation?  Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  40  RF: Oh, he loves music, since he’s writing music. (PAUSE) He likes fishing. He loves fishing. His father loves fishing.  AR: Where does he go?  RF: Oh, they go out. They went to the Keys with other friends. Or I’d take him to the pier in Grendall Park. Right there on the pier we’d go fishing and I’d sit there I’d leave everything, you know, at the house, and that’s what we’d have to do. We’re worried about, you know, oh, the house should be clean or whatever, but then you leave everything for something that’s more important, like taking your kids to a park or taking your kids fishing or taking your kids wherever. So, my husband, he says he needs to do this, ‘cause [because] he’s working now in Broward and sometimes he finishes late he’s not able to be here more than when he used to work with the buses with me - and he says: “We have to be on top of him. You have to.” So I try to look at what programs there are for the summer, but they’re very expensive. Baseball - the Kiwanis, the Little Havana Kiwanis, they have a baseball camp in Shenandoah, but it’s limited and, although he participated in that program for like three or four years, but then he didn’t want to do baseball anymore. Maybe I should have forced him more to do it – so – But other things - I know that’s one of the worries of parents. You know, what they are going to do while summer - the break before summer school starts. ‘Cause [because] my kids have to go to summer school. You know, my son has to go to summer school. But before then - Well, I’m better off, ‘cause [because] I work - while he’s off, I’m off, you understand? So I have more. But I’m home. But I see them. OK, I tell them “Son, what do you want to do?” He says “Mom, don’t worry. I have things I do. I’ll go fishing. I’ll do, I’ll listen to my music and write my music.” I say “Oh, OK, OK.” So I’m less worried ‘cause [because] I’m here, but I think about those parents that have to go out and work the whole day. What [are] do those kids doing? Do they know where their kids are? So it would be so nice - where automatically there’s a program with the school system or something, that you know that, OK, school’s out on the 16th, OK on the 17th or on the 20th or whatever, a couple of days after – boom (snaps fingers) - there��s a program out there that’s affordable, good, affordable program that my kids can go to. There’s not. Parents Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  41  - that’s the main worry about a lot of parents, ‘cause [because] I know it. I know. I talk to parents and I hear those things. There’s no program - if there��s a program - Oh- wait a minute, it’s $200 - $500. The Boys’ Club is $500 to get in. Plus the field trips. You know what I’m saying? So it’s sad. They say - put children first - Put this - where are those programs - the more, better-off families, oh yeah, they can find good, good programs, because they have the means. But what about the other - rest of the population that they don’t have the means to get affordable - programs for the summer? That’s one thing that we need to address. Oh, and I addressed it once in the Metro-Dade when I went to one of those meetings. They talked about affordable day-care for families that are eligible. I said, but wait a minute. Let’s talk about the kids. If the family is eligible - but what about the kids? If they’re good Head Start programs, they should be for every kid, no matter if the family is - OK, if he’s rich, he can contribute a little more to that program. So, the other day something came out about making Head Start programs for everyone. For the kids! Don’t talk about the parents! If you’re doing a good program - a Head Start program - that you know that it has all the requirements - it’s going to make that kid a better kid when he enters kindergarten, don’t worry if the father’s rich - think about the kid! OK, so the parent is affluent - OK, what can you contribute to this cost -because another kid cannot contribute that much. But every child will be the same. You understand? So that’s what I mentioned. And it was taken into consideration, because they have a guideline for the kids who went to Head Start Program, they have to meet this certain guidelines if you’re rich. I mean, you’re talking about a kid, you’re not talking about the family - OK the family is rich, but maybe they want their child to enter a Head Start program or enter a regular public program. I don’t know, that’s my idea. How I think. But, yeah, that family, if he can contribute, he will contribute to that program in a foundation - in a grant or something, but the child can still participate in that program so he can enjoy a good Head Start program that we cannot find in the private - I mean there’s good private - I know there’s fantastic private –  (END OF TAPE 2, SIDE 1)  Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  42  [TAPE 2, SIDE 2]  AR: One thing I was curious to ask you, you talked about concerns of your sons - are your concerns any different about your daughters?  RF: Well, yeah, I have concerns for them, although they’re bigger. But I am concerned about them, how they’re growing up and perceiving life and everything around them. If they’ll be successful in what they’re doing, you know, I worry about them ‘cause [because] they’re still young, although they’re in college and one of them is working, the other one is not. I want them to – know that there’s a reason for them to be here. (ANSWERS PHONE)  AR: So, I was saying --  RF: Oh, so when I tell my daughter, my oldest one, and she’s kind of – loco, you know. And I say “You have to get involved - you have to be involved. ‘cause [because] I’m getting old now, and you have to - be responsible and see that things are done correctly and if there’s something you don’t like, you know, call your representative, call your whatever - write ‘em [them] letters. And if you don’t feel something’s being done correctly in your school, you know, talk about it, get the students to --- talk about it.  AR: Well, let’s see - um - I think I’ve already passed through that. ( ) Well, I guess, I already asked you some questions earlier on about leisure activity and what did as a young person for entertainment - but what do you do for leisure recreation now? (PAUSE) Do you have time for leisure recreation?  RF: Not much. Not much. Especially as my parents’ grow older. Um, (PAUSE) You know, I try to – I have to attend to them and help them as much as I can. But sometimes - I get away sometimes. I go to the Keys or – I went to Nassau the other day with the whole family - the five of us. We went there. It was an experience you wouldn’t believe - with three kids. And just two days in Nassau and - so I enjoyed that pretty much ‘cause [because] nowadays it’s hard for us five to get together, you know, ‘cause [because] they want to be always out on their own, the girls, so, when they say, “Nassau, OK, it’s a free Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  43  ride. Let’s go and take what we can out of this trip.” So it was an experience for them also, ‘cause [because] we walked. We walked. I don’t know if you’ve been there any. So we walked from Paradise Island which is more of a casino resort or whatever, and we walked over this big, huge, bridge and it was walking for, I don’t know - to the hotel that we were in to Nassau, it was like a couple of miles and we had to walk with our luggages (sic) because my husband said “No, because if we walk we’ll see the town.” And they said “Never. Never again.” But he said “This is an experience. This is an experience.” ‘cause [because] he heard the frustration coming out of them. Like “God, this is so hard with the luggage!” And they were saying “Nobody does this. Nobody does this!” and you could hear them, the expression and their things about walking so many - such long distance with our luggages [luggage] (sic) And we were going to catch a bus and ended up, my husband said “No, it’s right there, it’s not far away.” And blocks and blocks and blocks and blocks. He said “No, it’s right there.” Blocks and blocks - and the kids were like - tired and exhausted. Oh, we couldn’t do anything that evening when we got to that hotel. The next day we were so fresh and going out and seeing the people. And there was like a flea market right on the - we were right in the center of, you know, the people there. And it was so nice talking to them and seeing how nice they dressed for the - it was like saying - uhm, uh, a boulevard where all the stores, big stores and nice stores and jewelry and perfume – Nassau - and how the ladies dressed so nice and neatly and talked to you very nice and all that. The first time I’ve been there, you know. So it was an experience for us.  AR: That’s great.  RF: So you know, that’s what we do –  AR: But you don’t go to movies much or -  RF: I go sometimes to the movies. Not very often. Sometimes I will just drive to the beach and see where my kids hang-out. And some of the beach – you know, go and see - it was like a couple years ago and my husband said - at one o���clock in the morning we went to South Beach, we couldn’t believe it - you know, how it’s so different than when I Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  44  grew up and we wanted to see the night life, you know, and the people that were there, ‘cause [because] my kids love the South Beach area and I also worry so much when they go over there. I’d rather have them go to the Grove sometimes than the Beach because of the water, you know, and so many people. But that’s what I do. And I stay home a lot, you know, take care of them. (ANSWERS PHONE)  AR: You know, another public place that we haven’t talked much about is the libraries--  RF: Just one - Shenandoah.  AR: The Shenandoah Library - do you use it a lot or do your kids use it a lot?  RF: Yeah, at least weekly we go there - pick up a book.  AR: You go there together?  RF: With my son, yeah. It’s basically my son and I.  AR: So does he read a lot?  RF: Not - He reads, but he reads what he likes. Fishing magazines and now he’s into the music and writing and he wanted to get a composition book so he could write things and, things like that. I gave some books and magazines to the library ‘cause [because] they’re - they have like a - you can donate books and things and they’ll either use it there or some other place where they have sales and other things like that. So, I gave some books out the other day, I have some books to give and I bought a book - two books - I bought the other day - 25 cents - it was nice. You know. It’s nice - the library - that library���s pretty nice - everybody, like when you get there they say hi and they treat you like they know you. So, it’s nice.  AR: Do they have a lot of programs at this library?  RF: They have, now they’re having a live theater in all the libraries in Dade County.  AR: Live theater, Oh. Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  45  RF: Live theater - I have the brochure. And to Shenandoah it’s coming, all over now. In June - it started in like April - April, May, something like that. And they’re having live theater. And it’s very nice. You should take a look at that.  AR: Is it performed by --  RF: By uh, I don’t know if I have the brochure or not. Hold on (PAUSE) If you’re interested, you know, take a look at the brochure and it’s very nice and it’s free, you know, it’s free to the public. So –  AR: Is it well-attended?  RF: I haven’t gone to it - I haven’t gone, ‘cause [because] the others are in like West Miami, things like that, so in Shenandoah it’s coming this month, now, in June, so I’m planning to go. I want to take my son and get my daughters willing to go also. ‘Cause [because] it’s nice, there’s not a lot of, you know, like in this area - only if parents take their kids to the - to culture things. We have to expose more kids to that area.  AR: Yeah, that’s expensive too.  RF: It’s expensive- everything like that is expensive. There’s a person in Little Havana that he just told me, he mentioned the other day that they’re getting like a grant to do like a theater- like culture, you know, with the community. So I mentioned to him that about the library, so, I don’t know. He’s Sergio, uh, from the ( ) Clinic on 9th Avenue and Northwest 2nd Street. It’s a new health clinic that they did there - it’s for the community. ( ) A family- owned clinic. Sergio, that’s the director. I have this card there. So, there’s some theaters in Little Havana like Jose Marti, but it’s very – you know.  AR: I notice the theater that was - I think, was it just down the block - is it an opera ---  RF: Oh, the opera - Yeah, but that’s not the opera there - that’s like the headquarters or something, I think. I’ve never been inside but that’s what I think it is. Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  46  AR: Yeah, I don’t know. I just walked by and saw it. How about television? Do you watch a lot of television or do you stay away from it?  RF: I’d rather stay away from it. I usually have like a nice program – I like the Discovery channel, things like that. And I see the news, international and local, some of the local and international news and 60 Minutes and 20/20. Things like that I really like. I enjoy that program very [much] good.  AR: And your kids, do they --  RF: Um, they don’t watch many - a lot of TV. My daughter likes a little bit of the - sometimes - now. She sees sometimes the Cuban - not the Cuban, the soap opera - you know, the Spanish - some of the Spanish. And I say “What are you doing?” What is that for entertainment?  AR: How about the radio?  RF: I listen to some radio -  AR: What do you listen to mostly?  RF: I listen to some Spanish talk-show. Not very much. Just some of them, some that are right now – If you asked some of the traditional Cubans there might be some controversy.  AR: So the talk-shows are becoming --  RF: The radio talk-shows.  AR: Yes, the radio talk-shows. More liberal or more -  RF: Well, the ones that I hear are more liberal. Yeah. So, I don’t know if you’ve heard about him, the individual, but like the Transición…( ). He’s pretty much - now he’s started an English- speaking talk-show, radio, on WAX -790. It started today - live, from 8 to 9. And it was very interesting, what he has to say in Spanish. He has changed, I Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  47  think, he has changed a lot what is being said and how the news – and now it’s not really a lot of Cuban things that he talks about. It’s mostly Miami things, you know. Things that [are] is happening, things that usually you’d get in Spanish if it wasn’t really for what he says, you know, they wouldn’t put it in Spanish newspapers or radio or anything like that. So, um, he just got a contract to do English program on WAX. And today he interviewed uh, Doug Clifton, from the Miami Herald - He resigned. And he gave him an interview. Very interesting. Very interesting. And so, you know, he, he started in ’89 with his program and it’s been very -- But I enjoy that. I listen to that sometimes. And that’s it. And then the American station that I listen to for news and for quiet music or something like that, or relaxing Spanish music. I listen to that.  AR: Well, we’re almost done here - I just want to ask you a few questions about - well you answered that one - just some closing questions about the neighborhood - some questions in conclusion: Well, actually we’ve talked about this event a little bit, but if you could just talk a little bit about the changing face of Little Havana in terms of the diversity of people that are moving in from throughout and maybe even give me a sense of what that change has been like and where people are coming from and what groups are moving in and how that’s affected the neighborhood.  RF: Well, there is the, you know, the tradition - you know this is Little Havana but actually it’s more of a Latin American and the Caribbean. You know, like, we have a lot of people coming, well, for the past many years, we have Haitians in Little Havana. We have some Haitians. We have a lot of Nicaraguans, Salvadorians, Puerto Ricans, some Cubans coming now, a little bit more - in the past it used to be hardly that the immigration wasn’t very much - but lately I have a lot of Spanish - you know, Cubans that have come recently from Cuba, and in that area - Little Havana. Although some of them moved out. But there’s a lot of mixture. We have a lot of mixture. And we don’t have - I have Haitian clients ---  AR: Would you say it’s a smooth mixing? Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  48  RF: I think so. I think it’s pretty smooth. In a way, you know. They live together, you know. Like in the past you wouldn’t see that, you know. You have black people who are actually mixing in with the Spanish and things like that.  AR: And even though you always hear [that] about Cubans and Puerto Ricans don’t really get along and this and that - how much of that do you see and do you see a change in it?  RF: There’s not a lot of Puerto Ricans in that area. Puerto Ricans are in the Windwood area, mostly a little bit northern, not too much, but they have their own area, although some are there - Puerto Ricans, but not too many. Mostly, Nicaragua, Honduras, Salvador, you know, Haitians, some Haitians in that area - But, uh, it’s pretty good, although they do have their sense of, a lot of them feel that, you know Cubans are better because, you know, they have more power, they have more of the political, intellectual, you know whatever power to make – but I think it’s better. It’s better for the community that it’s more diverse and it’s - you have different points of view and, you know. I think your ideas are accepted more than traditionally they were. They’re accepted more by these Latin Americans you know, they’re people that you can talk [to] more – you know. And so, they express more their views [more] and accept you. I think I can - sometimes relate better to a person from Latin America than with a traditional Cuban, you know. They will understand I think, because of their - uh, where they came from, they have so little, and so, it’s so hard for them, that they understand that, you know –  AR: So I get the sense that you seem to really have inherited your dad’s um, sensibilities in a lot of ways.  RF: Oh yes—  AR: Well, your parents’ sensibilities actually, not just your dad’s--  RF: Oh, yes, yes. And I think I grew up in an era here that I was able to tolerate more different views and ideas and, you know, I accepted people because of –  AR: Because of developments here - you mean in Miami. Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  49  RF: Not in, no -- Because of my parents I mostly. Because they taught me - you know things then. And actually I just enjoy working with people and, as I told you, and when I wrote that I worked many years with legal services serving the poor. And, you know, you have to enjoy those things to be able to work…and those years, it was hard. We dealt with many things in legal services with issues of the poor, and health, and everything - nursing homes, from everything. Sometimes I got angry at an attorney for not being able to see a client or for some reason, and they’d say “Now Raisa, now wait a minute, you know, we cannot see everyone, because their issue or the case is not something we can help them with.” So, I had conflicts with, you know, things like that, with them. And I know them, a lot of them out there that are in private practice now and with the state and public defenders - but um, I enjoy that area - that period of time that I was able to help a lot of people and maybe make changes in their lives as I worked for them - you know, I worked for the improvement of their lives. And where there’s something that I thought was not correct, I would say “Why, why are we doing this? Why are they not awarding benefits to this person, or why is this person not being denied for this reason?” And when I go into the offices here, and I see the workers and how they deal with these people, I said “Why, why? Those people are [in] need. They’re not here because they want to be here. They’re just in need, you know. And they should get what they need.” So, I guess, that’s how I am. And basically, I feel pretty good. I really like my time. I get tired and say I don’t want to do anything else.  AR: Well, I guess the last question or two here are what would you consider to be the best things - the strengths of the neighborhood, of your neighborhood, of today, and what things would you like to see changed?  RF: That’s an easy one right? What is the strength? (PAUSE) Well, the - I don’t know - the diversity. The strength – Got me there. I don’t know. The strength would be like being able to adapt, or try to adapt to, a different – place, to a foreign place. You know it affects us as, you know, when we’re small, we don’t think that it’s going to affect us. But it does. But we were able to adapt to a society that was different from our society where we came from. And the people, from Latin America, that are able to come here and adapt and try to look for work and work and even though it’s hostile sometimes, and Raisa Fernandez  June 1st, 1999  50  the environment and the kids having to learn a different language, you know. I think that would be the strength. And what would I want to change? (PAUSE) What would I want to change? Oh, the people - to be able to, you know, to get along better, to work together better and being able to bring things into the community that will improve everyone’s life and the kids and the families and – I don’t know. (PAUSE) To try to work together and bring, uh, improve the lives of the people in the area and all over. I guess.  AR: That’s good. Thank you very much. I’ve greatly enjoyed this.  RF: You’re welcome.

Interview with Raisa Fernandez			Fernandez, Raisa	Regalado, Aldo J.			1999-06-01	Miami, Florida	Raisa Fernandez relates her experiences concerning her early life in Cuba, and the transition to life in Miami when she was 10-years-old in 1960. Much of the interview deals with her parents, their humanitarian vision, their struggle for social and political reform, and their subsequent troubles with the Cuban government. However, the focus of the interview lies in Raisa’s perceptions of public space, and the needs of Little Havana as a neighborhood. This leads her to reflect on her role as a parent, and on her experiences as a school bus driver.

The date is June 18, 1999, and we are beginning the interview at 9:13 AM. The focus of this interview will be Mrs. Baker-Bouie’s recollections of her neighborhood experiences and her reflections of public space issues in Miami. [recorder is turned off and then back on] Okay, so, I guess we can start with when and where you were born.  Sabrina Baker-Bouie: I was born in St. Augustine, Florida, on March 11, 1959. Do you want me to continue?  AR: What did you--. Were you raised there? Did you--?  SB: No.  AR: Where--Where did you move to--? Where did you move to and when?  SB: My dad was in school at Florida Normal, it was called at the time. And when he finished school we moved to Sanford, Florida, which is my mother’s hometown. And we--we stayed there until about 1968, and then we moved to Miami. So, part of my life was growing up in a small town right outside of Orlando, and then the other part was—the majority of it—was here in Miami.  AR: Okay, where did you live in Miami?  SB: We lived in the Carol City area. Grew up going to the public schools in that area, Miami Gardens Elementary, Carol City Junior High it was called, and then Carol City Senior High.  AR: Did you have any brothers or sisters who would be--?  SB: I have all sisters--.  AR: All sisters?  Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  3  SB: And they’re four sisters. Three of the sisters have lived with me the whole time. I have an older sister that lived with her mother. My father had a child before he and my mother met.  AR: How would you describe your siblings, your sisters? How did you get along with them and just--?  SB: We did the normal [chuckles] fighting, but we were all very close. I’m the oldest of the sisters that have lived together. So, I kind of was the one who was in charge of the--of the family when the parents were away. So I’m more the motherly one of the younger three.  AR: How about your parents? What did they do for a living? And--and, yeah--. And how did you--. How did you relate with your parents?  SB: Before we moved to Miami, both my parents were teachers in the public school system in Sanford. Then we-- we moved because my father got a job with Florida Morgan College when it was moving to Miami as a Director of Alumni Affairs. My mother taught reading for a while at the college -- she's a reading specialist -- and she later became the director of Upward Bound, still at Florida Morgan College. They’ve since moved on. My father, later was in the public school system in Dade County and started out as a visiting teacher and retired as a community school principal for Northwestern. My mother is now the director of the Miami-Dade Chamber of Commerce. After leaving Florida Morgan, she was the director of the United Negro College Fund for a while. And then--then she left the job with the Miami-Dade Chamber. She’s still working.  AR: Would you describe your childhood as a happy one?  SB: Oh, yeah.  AR: Yeah?  SB: We did a lot of things together, a lot of family Sunday afternoon trips, a lot of--. There was a lot of encouragement in the house for us in terms of education, in terms of love and support. So, a very happy childhood. Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  4  AR: Okay, just a sense of where you are now. Are you married? Do you have kids? Children?  SB: I am a widow. I have two children, ages six and eleven--a boy and a girl. The boy is older.  AR: [laughs] Okay. Yeah. All right. And--. And could you give me a sense of your--of your--of your work life, what you’ve--well of your education, and then your-- what you’ve done for a living since then?  SB: After finishing from Carol City I went to college in Alabama, Tuskegee Institute. Received a four-year degree, a B.S. degree in political science. I came back to Miami, got a job with the City of Miami in the planning department as a planning intern. About the same time, I enrolled in FIU. I got a master’s in public administration. I worked for the City of Miami for eleven years. Started out as a citizen planning intern, moved up to a position of an administrative assistant, primarily assigned to the Overtown area, and a redevelopment project called Southeast Overtown Park West. The department was later merged into the Department of Development, and I became a Program--I think it was called Program Director, I can’t remember the exact title now. And that was assigned to, not just Overtown, but developing RFP’s for all open spaces that the City of Miami owned, and in some cases acquiring land for the City of Miami for development projects. I left the City of Miami and went to work for Miami-Dade Community College on--as the program director of a new project, Neighborhood Transformation in the Overtown Area. Then I left Miami-Dade Community College and came here to Bellafonte TACOLCY Center, where I am the executive director.  AR: And, you mentioned purchasing lands for--for development and then the other new thing. What--? Could you elaborate on what exactly, you know, I guess the mission of your jobs was and--and, well yeah, just--?  SB: One of the biggest projects was purchasing land in the Overtown area, the land closest to the Arena. This was long before the Arena was there. In fact, the land the Arena is on is one of the parcels that we purchased. We--. During the time, the property from Fifth Street up until Eighth Street, Second Avenue to Third Avenue in Overtown, as well as a couple of blocks just Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  5  east of Second Avenue, was purchased for a housing development project. And the major feature of the project was to provide opportunities for folks to come back to the downtown area. And therefore, there would be some units set aside for those persons who were low-income, who wanted to remain in the area. So we purchased homes and buildings, relocated residents to other parts of the neighborhood if they wanted, or--. In fact, they had opportunity to go wherever they wanted to. They received a relocation payment and a moving stipend. The land just north of the arena where there are two apartment buildings is called Park West. And that particular area was also purchased by the City of Miami. There’s some land that was purchased by the City of Miami in what is called the Overtown Historic District, which is between Eighth Street and Tenth Street and Second and Third Avenues. There was an additional land that was purchased just north of ( ), which is on Second Avenue right near Eighth Street. And that was developed as a plaza, an open space for people to come and relax. It was supposed to be a space that would connect, eventually, folks from Overtown all the way over to Biscayne Bay. It was supposed to be a unique paving pattern that kind of just brought you from the Overtown area without any interruption into what is called Park West, but it could take you all the way over to Biscayne Bay. The other part of the project was RFP’s--putting out RFP’s for developers to come in and then develop other public spaces in terms of, um--. We had a RFP out for the Marine Stadium at one time, to develop that area. The Marine Stadium had fallen into disrepair, so someone who could take over and restore the stadium, as well as have some shops and restaurants. That kind of went from the Marine Stadium to the Rusty Pelican. The controversial Virginia Key RFP was just starting. The part that I had was the space--not where the beach is, but the space directly across from Marine Stadium--to have that be developed as a nature walking center, similar to what you see in the Everglades, with wooden sidewalks that kind of go out into the Everglades and you can, you’ll see the birds and other kinds of marine and bird life in that particular area, as well as get an educational ( ) to the community. So that's--that was the primary function. I think I also had Bicentennial Park, which we were still trying to decide what to--what to do with at the time. And then the Neighborhood Transformation Project was clearly very different from my role at the City of Miami, because this particular project was working with the residents of Overtown, so that they could begin to tell us what they wanted for their lives: how they wanted their neighborhoods to be shaped, what they felt was important, you know, versus what was not important. And so it was a lot of focus group meetings with residents: learning a lot about the Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  6  history of Overtown, learning a lot about the desires and wishes of residents of Overtown, and then trying to package what the residents wanted with funding and the willingness of others to make it happen. The program, however, ended. It was a-- it was a pet project of Dr. McKay when he was at Miami-Dade Community College and Dr. Tessa Pollock, who was at the medical center campus. And upon their departure, the program ended with the new president, who thought it would be better suited as a City of Miami project. The City of Miami--when it left the college, I left to come here--the City of Miami kept the project for a while. And then they later, I guess disbanded it.  AR: Well that brings up a lot of points. First, on the open-space, closed-space issues, the Marine Stadium, the Park West, and all of that. Were you--. Did--. Were these initiatives successful? In what ways? And, yeah--. How would you measure the success of those initiatives?  SB: In terms of the original intent, I would say they were not successful--.  AR: Could you be specific?  SB: The original intent of the Overtown Park West Project was to go from Fifth Street all the way up to I-395. The program, right now, has one development that is partially completed in the Overtown area, which is Pontiana Village. The--the pedestrian open space is only one block. Rather than going from Third Avenue to Biscayne Boulevard, it’s only between the Metrorail station and Second Avenue. The remaining blocks in Overtown are now--two or three of them are used for parking for the Arena. The remaining block is vacant and fenced-in and not always maintained. So in terms of the initial drawings for a lot of the developers that had planned to do those sites, have either gone out of business or are no longer interested. The city put out another RFP, some time later, for another developer, but the development is not under way. On the Park West side, the arena was not the original intent for that particular space. But the plan was later modified to include the arena since the city owned the land. So in many respects, in terms of the full intent of the project, no, it was not successful. Some things happened. Some development has taken place. There--there is some rental property on a couple of the lots. And like I said, Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  7  there is some--what do you call it-- home ownership on the other lot. The space just north of the Lyric Theater which was purchased is going to be turned over for the development of the Lyric Theater. But a lot of this land was purchased many, many years ago, and still, in many cases, it’s either vacant or the development’s partially finished.  AR: What would you say were the biggest obstacles in terms of meeting the provisions--the original provisions?  SB: Money.  AR: Money?  SB: Money was the biggest issue. The full plan really called for these initial so-called pilot projects to kind of spur the interest of folks and then development would kind of just take off from there. But it has not generated that interest yet for others to want to come in and do it. Secondly, the whole cost of construction and developing the property--. The interest has not--has not been like a windfall. You know, it’s still pioneer, there are still people who are being pioneers in a market, are coming into a low-income neighborhood, and a neighborhood which has a lot of history, both negative and positive. The negative, which is more prevalent in folks’ minds right now, is--is what is keeping a lot of people from wanting to move back to Overtown. Safety is a big concern. So the developer who has the home ownership has problems selling those units, although the units were considered to be affordable and, you know, you’re right next to Metrorail, and you’re near downtown, and you’re near the expressway. And so all of the amenities that we've grown accustomed to in the suburbs were all there in terms of access, but you’re still dealing with the surrounding community, which is not necessarily, in terms of looking out your window, you know, picturesque. So, that--that had been very slow. And then the whole--the whole idea of lending--the lending institutions willing to take the risk on such developments has not been there. The city subsidized a lot of it at first, but the money can’t stay tied up forever in terms of subsidies hoping things would work. Some private funding would have to--to be included, with the public subsidies. And the private funding was just not there.  Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  8  AR: So--so, the--Obviously lack of interest from these financial--financial and business interests. What would you say was the feedback from the community in terms of these initiatives? Was there--? You know, were they--were they indifferent? Disinterested? Or was the community aware and fully behind these initiatives?  SB: No, the community was not necessarily behind it. Initially, the community thought it was a good idea. But at that time the community thought that they would be able to move into some of those units. When the first set of home ownership units at Pontiana Village got underway, clearly those units were not affordable to Overtown families. For working folks downtown, they were very affordable. I think the prices start out at 62,000 dollars. When you think in terms of the people that we had already relocated from those units, from that area, many of those people had large families when they were already living in substandard housing. And so to them, to be able to afford a 62,000 dollar one-bedroom unit didn’t make sense to them. And the three-bedroom units were way outside of their--their range. And at that time folks started to realize that they weren’t going to be able to move back into the area that they had lived in for a long time. They weren’t going to be able to afford those units. So their lifestyle was not really getting ready to change, but that most of the people that would be in those units were people who came from other neighborhoods. So they were--they weren’t like, oh, this is so exciting. But then some people saw it as an opportunity for growth. Some in the neighborhood thought, well, there’ll be a different income level in this community, and the neighborhood will get more respect. But pretty much now you have separate communities, you know. The folks who are in the home ownership, that’s almost a community by itself. There’s not a lot of reaching out to the rest of the Overtown neighborhood. So, you--. There--there’s no connection.  AR: How about in terms of the--of the public space initiatives, like the, you know, the scenic walkways and all of that? Was that--Was that dealt with by the public or by the community or did they mostly concentrate on housing aspect of it or--?  SB: Well, the community voted on the whole plan.  AR: As a--?  Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  9  SB: As a whole package. And the whole plan was from Fifth Street to I-395. The initial development would be a mixture of home ownership and rental. As you got further into Overtown, like about Eleventh Street, it would be a lot of in-fill housing on vacant lots, as well as some rehab of existing structures. So it was supposed to be a neighborhood that was a combination of things. You can go from upscale to--to moderately priced to some scattered low income units. Then there was to be a mixture of open spaces, as well as some commercial and retail activity to support this new community. The support services were never there. So many of the residents that lived in these new housing units, while there was a major grocery store--not major, but major in terms of the neighborhood, right on Third Avenue and Fourteenth Street--people who live in the new housing travel outside of Overtown to do grocery shopping. They don’t use the neighborhood one.  AR: Why’s that?  SB: Well, the location of this particular store is kind of like deep into the Overtown area, and so there’s some apprehension about it. Then--then there was some concern about the quality of the products in the store, and then the prices.  AR: Do you think--do you think that the concerns are reasonable? Or do you think that they're--that they’re unfounded?  SB: No, they’re reasonable. Because I worked with the Overtown neighborhood and got to know the people in the street, going to the store was not a big ordeal for me. But the store is not in a location that would make you feel comfortable. It’s right on the other side of an expressway. So if you weren’t really going to the grocery store, you wouldn’t know it was there. I have purchased items out of the grocery store on occasion, and the items are slightly higher than what I would have paid at Winn-Dixie. They might be a little bit less than what you might pay at Publix. But in comparison to--to some of the major chains, the prices are slightly higher. Now in terms of the products, they have all of the same products that you find in those grocery stores. Those--that particular grocery store seems to serve more of the residents that are on like Eleventh Street and higher in terms of Overtown. But--. Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  10  AR: What’s the name of the store by the way, now that you mention it?  SB: [pause] I’ll think of it. [laughing] I think it’s Crown, Crown Grocery store.  AR: How about the issue of-of crime in the neighborhood? Would you say that that is fairly or unfairly portrayed in the media and--?  SB: Crime does exist in Overtown. But I think they’ve gotten some really bad publicity. Unfortunately, anything that happens in the surrounding neighborhood--. There've been times when I’ve been at home listening to the news and they’ll talk about a crime incident in Overtown. And when they give the location, it’s either near the Omni, it might be somewhere near Biscayne Boulevard, which is not Overtown. Overtown boundaries, the eastern boundary is F and C railroad tracks. So everything over by the school board offices and the Omni area is not Overtown. But that’s the address that they use. There’s been a couple of times when something has happened not too far from Jackson, and they said Overtown. And then the western boundary is Seventh Avenue, so clearly it wasn’t--wasn’t Overtown. And then the area just north of Overtown, it’s the same thing, you know, it���s designated as Overtown. Overtown has its fair share of--of crime. Primarily most of the crime is drug-related incidents; there’s some domestic violence incidents, but we’ve worked very closely with the police. And dealing with the statistics for Overtown, Overtown’s crime rate was lower than Little Havana. But it’s not publicized that way. So, it seems to me to have gotten a bad break in terms of media making the portrayal of the neighborhood be far worse than what it is. I’ve heard them talk about the schools and how people don’t care. And I’ve worked with so many people in Overtown who are concerned about the safety of the kids, who hate the garbage all over the place, who have on more than one occasion asked the city and the county--because many of them, most of vacant lots in Overtown are owned by the city and the county, which most people don’t know. And those lots are overcrowded and filled with garbage. And so the residents of Overtown have asked both the city and the county, clean up your own mess, and that would make the neighborhood look a whole lot better. But a lot of those cries have been unheard.  Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  11  AR: Why is that? Why the--. Why the neglect, do you think, in your opinion?  SB: Well, one--. There’s probably a couple of reasons. One is voting. I think people in Overtown are starting to realize that they have to vote. The politicians have to see them as a strong base of contention. So as decisions are being made, you know, they have some respect for that neighborhood, because they know that that neighborhood could either keep them in office or put them out of office. Secondly, Overtown right now is primarily a rental community. The home own--the property owners live not in Overtown. And so, in terms of the taxes for the city, it’s not necessarily from the property taxes of folks who live there. It’s from folks who, you know, might be in New York City. And then there’s just a lack of consistency. You know, the people in Overtown scream and shout today, and then after about a month or so they--they feel beaten and like nothing’s going to happen, and so they give up. You have to be consistent. It’s really the old adage that the squeaky wheel gets the oil. You have to constantly be squeaky, but you got to be very consistent with your message.  AR: How did, with the NTP--I guess the--the project, going in and asking the residents who returned what they want, working with the residents who returned, what they want--? Could you characterize their concerns and their more salient demands or requests that they made a point of action?  SB: Well, when we first started the project, we had to listen to more of the--the anger from the residents about what had been done to them. The residents were very angry about the expressway that chopped up their neighborhood. They were very angry about the Metrorail that--that further chopped up their neighborhood. And so we spent quite a bit of time listening to--to those voices of anger at first. They even went back to, I guess, it must have been the early sixties or seventies, at a time when there--there was a project called Urban Renewal that came through and bought up a lot of land from folks and relocated them and told them that a new development was coming. And that land is still vacant now, and the new development has not come. After we got through that, then they started to talk about what they wanted for their community. And a lot of it was just some equality. They wanted to have regular trash pickups. They wanted to not be harassed by police. They wanted the police to remove the criminals from the community, Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  12  because they felt that the police knew who they were and what they were doing. They wanted code enforcement. They felt that the city was allowing these buildings to just fall apart. They wanted better schools and better school opportunities for their children. They wanted to have safe places for their children to play. They wanted the parks to be safe and not be a place for drug deals. They wanted activities in the park. They said that they had very nice parks, but they didn’t have a lot of activities, structured activities, in the parks. And they wanted it to look better. They wanted to bring some businesses there. There were certain things that they--they--. For one, the bank was one of the results of this process, because they felt that they shouldn’t have to go outside of their neighborhood for everything, that some of the stuff should be in their neighborhood. Once in a while they said they simply wanted some respect. They wanted to be treated fairly and they just wanted some respect.  AR: Yeah. And--and--. How--how successful--. Well, you’ve mentioned basically the program fell apart after passing from the university to--to the city. Do you think--? [Tape cuts off mid question]  [END OF SIDE 1]  [START OF SIDE 2]  AR: This is Aldo Regalado continuing the June 18 interview--June 18, 1999, interview with Mrs. Sabrina Baker-Bouie at her TACOLCY office. This time is 9:57 and we are beginning side two of tape one. Okay, so I had just asked you what strides you think the project made in terms of--before--before running--coming to a halt--in terms of addressing some of these things in the community.  SB: One of the things that came about as part of this process was the development of a merchants’ alliance, and that component is still in place today. The other was some beautification projects. There’s a beautification project that is right along the expressway along Fourteenth Street. That was a result of--of this particular program. Under the I-95-- I-395 expressway, in that document you’ll see a program that was designed by the residents that will call for that area to be lightened up for one, the pillars to be painted with murals depicting the Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  13  history of African- and Caribbean-Americans. That program is still--. It’s in the--the--. The Department of Transportation decided they liked that one and that they wanted to do it. And so they set aside some planning grant money last year to get the program going. And this year, or next year I believe it is, they’re supposed to set aside some money for construction of that particular program. There were a couple of health projects that we participated in. One was called Growing Up Healthy with the Ann-Marie Atkin Clinic that has been taken on by Leonard Tekell, who would also be a good person for you to talk to. And he has kind of resurrected that project, working in conjunction with a Dr. Glade out of the University of Miami. And so some aspects of the process, in terms of residents participating and being involved in what goes on in their neighborhood, is still happening. We used to do a project called the Marketplace in that open space I talked to you about closest to the Lyric Theater, where once a month we would ask merchants to--we would put booths up and ask the merchants to come and show their wares, have music and food and activities for the kids. And so it became like a town center party of sorts. And so as I understand it, there have--there’ve been a couple of attempts to do that, but there’ve also been a number of residents who’ve asked that that be done again. And, so some aspects of it is--is still kind of hanging out there. What it needs is some individual or individuals to kind of pull everything back together. But the thought is still very prevalent in the minds of the residents.  AR: You mentioned these kind of sense of priorities--of opportunities for the community to come together in--in space, in a public space like that. Do you, can you recall, or are you aware of any other similar types of community gatherings, or events, festivals, or that sort of thing where this type of--of coming together can take place?  SB: I am told that years ago, many, many years ago, there used to be parades. In fact, I was told that the Orange Blossom Parade used to come through Overtown. But other than--than that particular parade, I’m not familiar with any other festival or event like that. Now the Black Archives annually holds a Jazz in the Park on the grounds right next to the Lyric Theater, which is really right in the same area where we did the Marketplace. I’m not real sure how well that is supported by the residents. But they bring some jazz musicians there and folks can sit out and listen to the music. That area has also being used as the location for the Heat when they do their Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  14  Thanksgiving turkey distribution. And in fact, we worked--when I was with Overtown () we worked with the Heat on the very first one of those that had activities for the kids, as well as the players coming out and--and giving out the turkeys. Now, I don’t know if they still quite do it that way with the big festival part of it, but I know the residents really enjoy just the whole ability to be dancing. We have the DJs out, and on the part of the plaza there people will be out dancing and--and then the kids will be in the grassy area running and playing and--. Then you still have the merchants along the sidewalk area of the plaza with booths on both sides, just distributing whatever they sold in their stores normally, as well as some of the restaurant vendors will be cooking. And so you had the whole flavor of these--these wonderful dishes of--of a lot of them were either soul food dishes or Caribbean dishes. Then there was one vendor that had cakes, all different kinds of cakes there. So it was an opportunity for people to get out and do something different, but still an opportunity for merchants to make some money. So we all--we had a two-fold process.  AR: Do you think--. So would you say currently that that type of opportunity is few and far in between?  SB: Oh yeah.  AR: Yeah?  SB: There’ve been a couple of cases--Barbara Waite would be another person for you to talk to from the City of Miami--what Barbara has gone in and done a few activities in the park. Right now she’s trying to put together plays in the park; Theater in the Park is the name of it, where people would come together. There’s a stage at Gibson Park, and they would do plays there. Now we’ve done an Easter egg hunt at Gibson Park, and we did--I can’t remember the name of the activity--but we also did--oh, I know what it was--a Kwanza activity in--in Gibson Park. And we had the giant slide and some rides for the kids and music and the story of Kwanza and food in the park. So we try to use--we try to utilize existing open spaces, because Overtown has a lot of wonderful open--open space, and a lot of it is not utilized by the residents of Overtown.  Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  15  AR: Why not? Why not utilize, do you think? What are the barriers to that?  SB: Um, structure.  AR: What was that?  SB: Structure. There’s not a lot of structure.  AR: In terms of--?  SB: Well, for example, the parks are staffed during the week, but on the weekends there’s not really staff in the park. And during football season the residents of Overtown use it because they have Optimist Football. And so any given time the park--Gibson Park especially--is filled with people during football season, utilizing the park.  AR: And so it was what football?  SB: They have Optimist.  AR: Optimist?  AR: Yeah, they have their own Optimist League in Overtown. So they utilize the park for--for games, for home games. Now occasionally a resident might use it for a birthday party for a child. But pretty much in the spring, people from other neighborhoods come in and use it for baseball. Baseball is not like a real hot sport in Overtown, and at that time most of the residents will be using the park for basketball. So the--the bigger spaces are not being utilized and that--. I guess it’s hot, and a lot of those spaces are not well shaded as well.  AR: So, lack of shading, you say lack of staffing in terms of park personnel--?  SB: On the weekends.  Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  16  AR: On weekends.  SB: Now during the week it’s used, because many of the parks have after school programs. And so the kids are in the park in the afternoon doing tutorial, and they’ll be playing some games. And during the summer it’s crowded because the pools are open, and a lot of kids are playing in the park.  AR: So--so they’re relatively important in terms of looking at any--. And yet you say that they’re underutilized.  SB: There could be more activities. You know, if you--if you go into an area like Miami Lakes, there are year-round sports activities operating out of those parks. Those parks are staffed for Saturday and Sunday events. There’s soccer going on during soccer season. There’s baseball going on with a league during--during baseball season. There’s not a baseball league in Overtown. There’s football going on during football season. Then there’s basketball. So year-round there is--there is staffed sporting events which children have been recruited to participate in or have volunteered or however gotten in. But any Saturday or Sunday in Miami Lakes--and I’ve passed them periodically--there is an activity going on. Now the Optimist in Overtown is not necessarily--it’s not a city staff. It’s an independent group of folks, and they only operate, at this point, football. There’s not another league for baseball. So there’s no structure at that point for organized sport--sporting activities.  AR: And--. And I assume that what impedes the formation of that again is probably tax-based, the neglect and, the same issues, funding--.  SB: Funding, yeah.  AR: You mentioned--. You mentioned crime taking place in the parks. You mentioned crime--the parks being used for drug deals.  SB: Uh-huh. Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  17  AR: Do you think--. Is crime, as well, a prevalent problem in parks--in these unattended parks? If so, you know, how much does that play in terms of not--of preventing people from using the park?  SB: It plays a big part. There’s a park in Overtown right underneath the expressway at Tenth Street--I think it’s Range Park--which is rarely used by Overtown residents. And it’s largely because of the kind of negative activity that goes on in the park. There are quite a few homeless that have made that park home. There is some drug activity that goes in that park. And then, I guess, because of where it is situated, there’s not a lot of light. So it’s a very dark park. At one point there were basketball goals underneath there, and it’s this--was some green space underneath there. But in all of the years that I’ve worked in that particular community, I’ve never, ever noticed that park being utilized in some very productive way. There’ve been some occasions on the weekend where somebody might come put out a big stereo system and play music, but it’s still not with a--a crowd of--of residents there. You might have a few people drinking and--and playing cards or something, and so the music is for their personal entertainment. But it’s not a well-utilized park. Then you have a couple of--I think they might have been removed since then--. There were a couple of little spaces in between buildings that the city made into these little mini-parks, they called them. And, there used to be one on Second Avenue right near Eleventh Street, there was a mini-park, I don’t even know if it had a name, mini-park number something, and it had benches there. But primarily it became a spot for people who wanted to sit in the park and drink. So, it was again not a healthy park activity. It was, you know, a spot where a bunch of vagrants or other derelict kind of folks set up camp. And so it was their--their park. And so those kinds of open spaces in Overtown were not good open spaces. And then you have something like Gibson Park, Williams Park, and Dorsey Park. All three of those parks have baseball fields for one. And you have to think about, you know, you have these big baseball fields in a neighborhood that’s not really baseball oriented. So, I don’t know if any conversation was ever conducted with the residents to figure out if you have a park environment, what kinds of things would you like to see here? What kinds of things would cater to you and your needs? We had at one point a softball game that we did with the kids. And the kids--the children enjoyed it, but we were not staffed at Overtown in partnerships to conduct Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  18  softball games. So this ends up being an every-now-and-then kind of event. And then the park staff that is there, when they are there, they have so many kids. You know, you have may--you have one, I think there was one park worker at Dorsey. You know, and you have so many kids that you’re trying to do things with. That’s quite a big number of kids to try to manage. There might have been one or two at Williams Park. I think it increases in the summer when--when the pool is open. Gibson has maybe one or two people as well. And at Gibson Park they have a gym, and there were--. People could come and work out. And there’s also a library at Gibson Park. So you would think that--. I guess--. And the population of Overtown continues to decrease as well, but you would think that with about ten thousand people and a 1.2 square mile area, that you would have much more activity in the park. You see more kids, for whatever reason, playing in the street or in the--in the courtyards of their apartment complexes than you do in the parks.  AR: Do think that it’s a personal--the kids’ choice? Or parents’ choice?  SB: I think a lot of it might be parents’ choice. I mean, with a park that might be understaffed, you--you would have to be concerned about the safety of the child.  AR: Even during prime hours?  SB: Yeah, you would have to be concerned about the safety.  AR: What about--. We mentioned the drugs and drinking and homeless, those problems. What kind of youth gangs? The--.  SB: Not in Overtown.  AR: Not in Overtown?  SB: There’s not a gang situation in Overtown. You may have had clusters of guys that kind of just hung out on a corner. But, you know, those were just ( ); they were not gang incidents. Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  19  AR: Where would you--. Where would you say those activities are actually--they’re focused citywide? Where would be more--? Where would you think people are more prevalent than--?  SB: You have gangs in Little Havana. Even--you had a couple of gangs here in Liberty City. You have gangs in Hialeah. There were a couple of gangs in Opa Locka.  AR: What about in the suburban neighborhoods? Are they even--? I’m just kind of throwing that out there--but, would you say that they are more or less ( ) that sort of activity?  SB: I’m--I’m sure they might have a couple of kids who are in them, but in terms of being very prevalent, no.  AR: So not. Okay, interesting. I was going to ask you--. ( ). I was going to ask you to name some of the major parks there, but I think you already mentioned most of them, or many of them anyway. Gibson Park, Range Park, Williams Park, Dorsey Park. Are there any other major ones that have been--that you haven’t mentioned yet?  SB: No. I don’t know--.  AR: Those are pretty much it.  SB: And the ones that are primarily used are Dorsey, Williams, and Gibson. Some of the public housing projects have little parks within them, and then they might have playground equipment there. They have one of those at Rainbow--Rainbow Development, which is up around Twentieth Street. And then they have one--I can’t remember the name of the development right now--but there is one on Fourth Avenue and about Tenth Street, which was done, I think, by Frito-Lay, where they came in and put in playground equipment for that particular housing development. I think it’s got--I can’t think of it now--that particular housing development. So within Overtown, at the time that we were there, there were 740 public housing units. And so within those--those major developments, you have smaller parks. There are a couple of little Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  20  small parks in the Town Park Village area, which is co-op housing. So they have some playground equipment within their developments.  AR: One issue that we talked about a little bit, but not a lot in terms of specific purposes is policing. We talked about the safety issue. And how sensitive do you think policing is to that district? And do you think there should there be more of it in--specifically in parks, if not in the neighborhood in general, or less of it? And what do you think of the quality of it as well?  SB: Well, in fact, that was one of the issues that should of--that came out of a discussion, focus group discussions with the residents. They thought that there should be more walking police presence. That most of the police presence was riding by. And that most times, police were riding by with their windows up, so they wouldn’t have a clue as to what was going on. And then there were many people who thought that the police were not their friends, and they really felt them as adversaries. There were a few people who--who felt that they had reported crime issues in the past, and one of two things happened: either somehow they believed the police had let out that they were the people who called, and so long after the police were gone they were harassed by these people who were doing very negative things; or the police didn’t respond. There was one occasion where a woman said, “I called you guys when they were--.” They had stolen a car from some other place, and brought it to this particular development, and was taking the car apart. And the woman said, “I was on the phone with you, letting you guys know that they were taking the car apart. And, you know, you guys didn’t come till two days later.” By that time the whole car had been stripped and the only thing left was the shell. So she--you know, the residents--. We had meetings with the police and residents. And the residents were saying, “We don’t see the point of calling. You know, you don’t come.” One resident said, “I told you when they were doing all these smash-and-grabs that there was a unit, a vacant unit in my building where they take all of the purses.” And she said, “I can show you where they are. There are a bunch of purses in there right now. But nobody will come.” I think the relationship is cooling. The--the city has started to be really effective with their neighborhood policing. So some residents are starting to build relationships with the officers, and a few of the officers now understand that their role has to be more than just strictly policing. They’ve gotten concerned about housing and housing conditions. And so I think long-term it could improve; it could be a Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  21  whole lot better. And there are some officers who genuinely want to be there. And then there--there are some others who see it as punishment. Now whether or not they’re going into the parks, I can’t say that that is occurring. In conversations with them, they said that many times because of the staffing issue that from the time that they check in and they are on duty, that they’re running from one call to another call to another call. And so to think that I’m just going to ride by and just check on the park, or you know, ride by and just, you know, see what’s going on is not possible, and that they would need some additional staffing, or they would have to be on special assignment to do it. Because officers in Overtown patrol an area a little bit larger than Overtown. At one point, they had a set of officers that were called “beat officers,” that were assigned to Overtown, and they only did Overtown. And then there were another group that was assigned to I guess that--that sector that was a little bit larger than Overtown. And then from time to time, because the beat officers were only supposed to be in Overtown and the sector officers got really swamped. The beat officers then had to also take calls. So when you--when you started to talk about--. “I’m doing--.” You know, they would give a list: “I’m doing this and this and this! You know, clearly I don’t have time to go and see what’s going on in the park.” They weren’t--. They weren’t necessarily interested in doing walking patrols. One officer specifically said, “It’s too hot.”  AR: It’s too hot?  SB: Yes, “We have on these vests and these dark uniforms, and it is too hot to get out of the car and walk around.” [pause] And that was said during a community meeting, so--.  AR: [laughing] How was the reaction to that?  SB: Oh, they were hostile. They were very hostile.  AR: [laughing] Oh gosh, I’m sure they were. Here’s something that I’ve been sort of curious about--.  SB: Uh-huh. Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  22  AR: --is you get the sense sometimes, when I’m talking to people that there are, within black enclaves in Miami, there are ethnic tensions between, let’s say Caribbean, black Caribbean and African-Americans, resident African-Americans. How--how intense would you say that division is? And how do you think it progressed, say, from the time, throughout the time that you’ve been in the community, or working in the community? Is it getting better? Is it getting worse? And why?  SB: There was some tension. Largely in the Overtown area it’s primarily African American. There--there is a very small group of Caribbean-Americans that have moved in on--maybe--maybe that’s First or Second--no First Avenue near--between Seventeenth Street and Twentieth Street in some housing that was part of a home--another home ownership project. And that group of people do not necessarily congregate with the bigger African-American community. So in terms of there being tension, I don’t think in that particular place there is. They’re just being ignored. There have been some African-Americans who believe that Caribbean-Americans look down on the African-American community. They believe that African-Americans have been here long enough to be better economically suited than where they are, that they should be more advanced than where they are. And the African-American community believes that the Caribbean community is not sensitive to the prejudices that we’ve had to overcome to get to where we are right now. And so, there is clearly a lack of understanding of culture, I believe, that causes the biggest part of the tension. And clearly we have to recognize that they are very different cultures. The Haitian community culture is far different from the Jamaican community culture, and all of them are far different from the African-American community culture, that brings with it a lot of baggage that many African-Americans aren’t willing to release.  AR: Could you be specific on the baggage?  SB: A lot of the prejudices that have--have existed throughout the years--we’re not able to overcome those, and we still tend to see things in light of what has happened. And folks always-- In fact, when I talk to older African-Americans--I worked with a historic project in the Grove and I interviewed an older white woman from the, I think, Peacock family. And all during the Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  23  interview she kept saying, the coloreds this and the coloreds that. And I was with Miss Ombrister who was a historian in Coconut Grove. And the whole time she kept, like, touching me and saying, “Let it go, let it go. That’s how they refer to us.” And I kept saying to her, “But at some point, she needs to be educated to understand we--we don’t refer to ourselves as colored anymore.” And--. “No, let them have that, let them have that.” And so after the interview, she did an education on me on some things we have to accept. But when you have someone that’s coming in from a totally different culture, who has not a clue what that word alone means to you and what you have to overcome to get to this point, then they--they then dump a layer of prejudice about where you should be, versus where you are, and then all of the criticism that goes along with it. That, along with the fact that there are many African-Americans who believe that folks who come from other countries get preferential treatment.  AR: Even amongst the blacks from other countries?  SB: Yes.  AR: ( ).  [SIDE 2 ENDS]  Tape# 2  [START OF SIDE 1]  Aldo Regalado: This is Aldo Regalado continuing the June 18, 1999, interview with Mrs. Sabrina Baker-Bouie at her TACOLCY office. The time is 10:29, and we are beginning side one of tape two. Okay. So I had just asked you if these perceptions were well-founded.  Sabrina Baker-Bouie: I would say, in my personal experience, no. I do believe that there are some prejudices that exist. [pause] But I don’t--I don’t believe it’s because of preferential treatment to one group over another. I think that a lot of--a lot of the prejudices, though, are--can be diminished if some of the government institutions stop promoting some of this. For example, when I worked with the City of Miami, if we wanted to do a project in Overtown, just based on the fact that Overtown needed the project, we had to--we had to figure out what we could do in Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  24  Little Havana. And so, in order to really sell the implementation of a project in Overtown, you had to make sure you packaged it with a little--a project in--a similar project in--in Little Havana. I don’t think that’s necessary. You know, I think that each neighborhood needs to be able to stand on its own, based on its own needs. And because you’re doing something in the black community, you don’t necessarily have to do the same project in the--in the Hispanic community, unless the Hispanic community needs that same project. So a lot of this is from--is--is generated because of the attitudes of folks in government. And the hostility continues to breed. And there are people in Overtown right now, if you talk to them about their neighborhood, they will always say to you, “It doesn’t happen in Little Havana. They wouldn’t let this happen in Little Havana.” That is always the comparison that they use. And so it breeds some unnecessary hostility between the Hispanic community and the African-American community, and not based on anything that these residents in these communities are doing, but based on the fact that, you know, if I’m going to spend a dollar here, I have to spend a dollar over there. Now your community may need ten dollars, but I’d rather give five over here and five over here. Why not spend the ten and at least get this community to a point where it is stable and--and then move forward. But to say, “I had ten dollars to spend over your neighborhood but I had to split it between Little Havana because I don’t want to make Little Havana mad, although I know you need the ten,” it breeds some unnecessary hostility.  AR: And would you say that--the way you talked about it sounds like the government’s the third party, in terms of the kind trying to balance, not make one community upset over the other. But would you say there are some political interests? That the motivation’s not just angering one community over the other, but that a lot of politicians actually have an interest in--. Say there are politicians who represent Little Havana who push raising over--. So in some sense--in some sense, it’s not so much a third party, but it’s also just in terms of the political bal--actual political balance in ( )--.  SB: It’s a combination--.  AR: That asserts power over--.  Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  25  SB: It’s a combination. There--. There--. I have been at commission meetings, though, where we have taken a project for Overtown, and a commissioner representing that area would say, “Well, what are you going to do about Overtown--about Little Havana?” And that project wasn’t even being brought to them about Little Havana. But because that politician is interested and very aggressive about Little Havana, he is going to--you can--you can just, you know, bet your life on it that he is going to say, “What about Little Havana?” And so when I worked for the city, we would go into those meetings already knowing we were going to have to give up something for Little Havana. The same thing didn’t always occur in the black Grove, you know. And didn’t always occur in Alapata. And they had commissioners who were concerned about those areas, but it wasn’t necessarily, you know, “If you’re going to do this project in the black Grove, what are you going to do about Little Havana.” But it was--it was pretty much very consistent. “If you’re going to do this in Overtown, what you going to do in Little Havana.” And I--I never could quite understand--. You know, I know they’re close in terms of proximity. But I never could understand why it was such an issue. And other neighborhoods clearly got left out altogether, you know. Alapata was not a neighborhood that received a whole lot of attention, and Wynwood was not a neighborhood that received a whole lot of attention. So, you know, you created some--some battlegrounds for folks. And then, it didn’t help with, you know, the--the last riot being caused by a Hispanic officer, you know, who wasn’t even assigned to Overtown. You know, so it was--. The hostility as it relates to ethnic groups is more African-Americans and Hispanics than it is African-Americans and Caribbean-Americans. Caribbean-Americans are primarily just ignored. But there are--there are some true battle lines between the Hispanic and African-American communities. And I--I think we can overcome those.  AR: What would be ways of overcoming those, do you think?  SB: I think there are opportunities to do joint activities. Language is a big--big barrier, though, between those two communities. I think a lot of it can be done with activities around children. Children tend to be very neutral grounds. And many of the children from both of these communities now--. For example, Douglas Elementary School goes from K through three, and then the children from Overtown are bussed to Riverside, which is in Little Havana, while the children from that part of Little Havana are bussed to Overtown for K through three. So there’s Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  26  already some exchange going on already among the kids, and the kids are not seeing it be as much of a problem as the adults. You know, they’re able to interact and do activities and joint projects. It’s just when you add the adults to the whole scenario that you--you get the big problem. [laughing]  AR: [laughing] Right.  SB: We tend to pollute things a little bit.  AR: I have at least one more question about ethnicity.  SB: Okay.  AR: Recently, the face of Little Havana has been changing. It’s not just Cubans now, but increasingly Nicaraguans, Colombians, Guatemalans, et cetera. Do you--. From the perspective of the black community, do you perceive that, do you think the black community perceives these changes, or is it all considered basically as Hispanic--?  SB: Uh-huh.  AR: --you know?  SB: The black community primarily goes by the language, not--not by the country. And in fact, if you’re speaking the language, regardless of where you’re coming from, they consider you to be Cuban. And for a very, very long time, even with the Puerto Rican community, you know, it’s--it’s Cuban. And so, there--in fact, there are very few African-Americans that will say Hispanic. It’s not a well-used word among the African-American community. Primarily, you would hear them use the word Cuban, and it doesn’t matter where.  AR: [laughing] Yeah.  Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  27  SB: So, I wouldn’t even tell you that they have not noticed that Little Havana has changed. As far as the African-American community is concerned, that still is Little Havana and it is still Cuban.  AR: Here’s another question that relates to ethnicity. When you talk about, sort of, a resentment in the black community for--for things that have happened in Little Havana, would you rec--would you--or with Little Havana, or done by Cubans--would you say the attitude in Little Havana is the same kind of resentment? Or would you say it’s--it’s primarily one of almost like just steamrolling over and ignoring the--the issues of African Americans? The same kind of--the same kind of negative perceptions that we talked about with say, Caribbean blacks who kind of just sort of have this--make these judgements on where African Americans should be. What would you say the Cuban community��s attitudes are towards Overtown and other--the rest of the black community in Miami?  SB: I’d say that the bulk of the community doesn’t care. I think they might be aware that these communities exist, but it’s like we have our own situation here. It’s, “We have our own problems, you have your own problems.” Now, there--there--. The park, when it’s used on weekends for baseball, that’s--those are Hispanic groups that come into Overtown.  AR: Which park? In Gibson Park?  SB: In Gibson Park.  AR: Is there any--?  SB: And Douglas Park. No.  AR: In Douglas Park? And there’s no mixing? So the--.  SB: Not Douglas. There’s Gibson, and, yeah. Yeah. There’s no mixing.  AR: So--so, you know, the Cubans come in and they--they have their--. But there’s no mixing. Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  28  SB: No.  AR: Do you think there could be, at these parks? Or do you think the cultural differences are just so great that--?  SB: I think there could be. I think if there was a real interest to really share the game, maybe someone willing to volunteer to work with a group of kids or--or to kind of introduce the game of baseball to the community, and then put together some real healthy competition, that there could be. Right now, the people of Overtown see it as, “They come here, they use our park, and then they leave.” And that’s--that’s the only thing I’ve ever heard it described as. And at one point-- It gets to be a problem if, say someone from Overtown wants to use the park on that same day, and they’re told that somebody else has already signed up for the park. Then you have an issue of, “How can they come and use our park? They don’t live in this neighborhood. We live in this neighborhood. We can’t even use our park.” You get a little bit of hostility there. Now what the folks in Overtown need to understand is there’s a process of signing up for the park. You know, these--this group, who wanted to play baseball, signed up for the park a long time ago. And in many cases, they have already signed up now, you know, for the next season of the dates that they want to play. And what the people in Overtown were saying, “It don’t matter. If it’s our park, it’s in our neighborhood, it’s for our residents. Why can’t they use the park in their own neighborhood?” And then you get, “If it was us, trying to go to Little Havana to use the park, we couldn’t use the park.” You know, and so you always get that extra little twist at the end of, “If it was us, we couldn’t do this. If it was us, we couldn’t--.”  AR: Do you think that’s true? Do you think--. Do you think that it would be harder for--for blacks from Overtown going to Little Havana to use the parks?  SB: Probably, just because of their own feelings of not feeling comfortable with their own neighbors.  AR: Not--not any institutional prejudice necessarily?  Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  29  SB: I have noticed, though, and I can’t explain why--. When I worked with the city, we did the--the police stations, and there was supposed to be a police station in Liberty City. Of course, we have to have one in Little Havana. And the Little Havana one was finished first. There was in--in Overtown, two health clinics that were done. One was in Little Havana, one was in Overtown. The one in Little Havana was finished first. I--I don’t know why. I’m sure it was not because of any intent to finish the one in the Hispanic community first. But when there’s no explanation, then it feeds into the hostility that is already there and you get, you know, “Why is everything finished first in the Hispanic neighborhood and, you know, months and months and months delayed in the black neighborhood?” And like I said, I have no answers as to--. And I worked on those--on those projects. I just have no answer as to why it is that way. And we have residents who--who are not really committed to the process either. One of the things that we try to do with the Overtown Neighborhood Partnerships program is to have people understand the process. If you go from introducing a concept, and you don’t involve folks anymore until now you have the thing completed, they don’t understand all of the obstacles that you have to go through from concept to implementation of the finished product. There’s a whole bunch of stuff in between. And so we really wanted residents to understand that this is not easy. You know, they feel they’ve just been left out of the process, but it’s not an easy process. And from where you sit, it looks that way. You know, if I see you here and then I complain about, “Nothing’s going on, nothing’s going on, nothing’s going on,” not knowing all of the hoops that you’re having to jump through to make this thing happen, and then the next thing I know, it’s underway or it’s completed, then I don’t know what happened in between.  AR: Why do you think--. Why do you think this--this lack of awareness of the process exists in--?  SB: It doesn’t exist like in all neighborhoods, but a lot in low-income neighborhoods, because people tend to feel that they won��t understand.  AR: So they don’t bother explaining anything to them, right?  Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  30  SB: It’s complicated. And when you try to break it down and explain it’s a complicated thing, they’re not going to understand it anyway. Or, you know, you don’t want the hassle, or the inconvenience. And then you--you’re able to justify that position when you go to community meetings and you expect thirty people and maybe one and two people show up. And then you say everybody’s disinterested, and you have, you know, the evidence to validate it. But what I’ve--I’ve learned working in Overtown, that pretty much you have to go where the people are, that there’s a big distrust of outsiders. When we started the process, we started to try to put together all of the different planning studies that had come out. There’d been like thirteen of them. And so I thought to myself, irrespective of where I lived, if there had been thirteen planning studies for my neighborhood, I’d be a little disenchanted too. You know, if--if thirteen planning studies and--and I can’t see the plan nowhere around, I would have a problem with that. So it’s not so much that they don’t care. But you have to--you have to really put yourself in people’s shoes and figure out if all of these same scenarios have gone on in your neighborhood, you know, where you have an expressway where you uprooted people; and you voiced your opposition and it happened anyway; and then you have a Metrorail system that you fought and it happened anyway; then you add to that the thirteen planning studies and the fact that you can’t get the garbage picked up; and then there’re overgrown lots where children--one child stepped on a needle in one of those overgrown lots, and another child was raped in one because the grass was too high. You add all of that to your scenario, and then try to figure out how you would feel about it, and I think most people would come up with some very similar feelings. You know, why go to another meeting? What--What will it serve? What is different about this meeting than the meeting we went to five years ago? And that’s what you--what you have. And so you have me, who might not have been there five years ago, and I’m coming out to the meetings, and I’m trying to present. I’ve got all of my maps and I have two people, but they’re not interested. And that’s--that’s my conclusion from this. And it’s not so much that I’m not interested, it’s just really I’ve had enough. Do something first, and then I’ll come around. We’re not using our real human thinking skills when we do some of these things. ( ).  AR: And that’s so true. I mean, you see that--you see that in other--in work environments, too, and it’s just sad to say, and when you don’t, and you don’t see response. It’s funny, but you know, it’s not funny. But it’s interesting and tragic when you see the same type of relationship Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  31  happen in the community, about the community. And a lot of it’s probably harder for people to realize that that’s why.  SB: Right. You know, I went into a woman’s apartment once in Overtown. She had come across the street and she said, “Somebody has to help. I called every place, and somebody has to help. I want you to come and see this.” I go over to her apartment. She stayed on the second floor in her building right across the street from where I worked. And when I walked into her building and into her apartment, her carpet was soaking wet. Literally, my feet were, like, squish, squish. I thought, “Your carpet is wet.” She said, “That’s what I want you to see.” And she said, “Touch the walls.” And I touched the walls and the walls were, like, wet. And there were--. She had all of her furniture sitting up on top of cinder blocks and everything was covered in plastic. And then there was a baby laying on the sofa. And I said to her, “You know, that baby’s going to get sick because there’s so much mold in here.” And I have had a problem with asthma--asthma as a child, and I could feel my--my lungs tightening from the mold. She said, “The baby has asthma. We have to keep him on a respirator.” And she said, “We’ve been trying to find someplace else to live.” And it was an apartment building that had been renovated with city funds. And she--she touched her cabinet, and it came off from the wall. I said, “We need to call the code inspectors, because this can’t go on this way.” She said, “I’ve--I’ve called them. They were already out here.” I said, “Well we--.” And everything I said in terms of, “We got to call here.” And she said, “They’ve already been here, these people.” And I kept thinking how--how can--how this be like this? And you know, it wasn’t like, you know, maybe you had a leak in your ceiling. I’m talking about from the front door all the way to the back door. I said, “Is it the toilet running over? Is it the plumbing?” She said, “It’s something from the roof.” She said, “You should go up to the third floor. They get it first, and then we get it, and then the first floor gets it.” So the first floor wasn’t as bad, because, you know the other units had taken the brunt of the water. But I thought, you know--. I had no explanation to the woman. And when I went across the street, I was so depressed and--and I was thinking, what more could we expect from her?  AR: And you thought this?  Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  32  SB: Yeah.  AR: You went through all of the channels?  SB: All of the channels. I ended up calling and saying, “Why ( )?” And they said, “Well, we have no place to put the people now.” And I said, “She’s got a baby sick.” So at that point I started to really think about how our environment impacts so many aspects of our life. Overtown has high absenteeism in the schools. And a lot of the reason is the kids have respiratory problems, where if you’re living in a housing unit that is filled with mold, you’re going to have a respiratory problem. We started to work with Dunbar Elementary to get--and Miami-Dade Community College--to get a nebulizer machine made, so that regardless if the kids weren’t feeling well, they could bring their medication and get on the machine. And they had a program through the American Lung Association that would deal with education. So we tried to match those programs with the schools. But prior to this time, all the schools were doing were being written by the superintendent for poor attendance. You can’t just operate in isolation is what I’m trying to say. You know, everything feeds off of everything else. And if you have a housing situation that is not a safe and sanitary situation, then you’re not going to be able to put--just put children in schools and have them to operate at a level that you would have in Coral Gables, when the conditions in the neighborhood are not the same. So then, your--your school, your children are--are not at a level where they should be. And then you have the dropout. And then you have the “this,” and then you have the--. But everything makes that some very common factors. And those factors, we’re not dealing with them. We’re not dealing with them. So you can have all the open spaces you want--very beautiful open spaces. But you still have to deal with some very basic human needs in order to get kids to feel comfortable to go to those open spaces. And when you get them to the open spaces, you’re going to have to have something for them to do. You’re going to have to have equipment if you want them to play. You’re going to have people to show them how to play with the equipment. Otherwise, yeah, they’re going to break it. You know, we have--. We’re in a park here. Without the proper instructions, they will tear up everything we have. But once we start to say, “This is how you utilize this particular toy,” or, “We expect for you to bring the ball back and not take it home because you don’t have a ball at home. But we need to have the ball back here if you’re going to play with it tomorrow.” Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  33  So, you know, we can’t just write everything off of, you know, poor people are just nasty, you know, people who don’t care. You know, a child is a child. My child, you know, if he had no toys or anything to play with, and he came to your house and you have, he’d probably want to take one of yours home. You know, and my child is not living in a low-income neighborhood. But that’s just the fact that “I like this. I don’t have this at my house. Can I take it home?” But, it’s no different from--from many of the things that we do in our own lives.  AR: Do you--. Do you see any hope, in terms of addressing these issues? Anything that’s being done now, in terms of building this infrastructure? What’s the best hope? Or do we have one?  SB: I just prefer to be optimistic. I just prefer to believe that the conditions can’t stay this way. I’ve had an Overtown resident recently tell me that they plan on suing the city and the county. And they wanted to know how could it be done, because they believed that the city and the county [were] was responsible for the conditions of the neighborhood. So I tend to believe that people are--are getting to the point where they’ve had enough. I’ve watched the Overtown Optimists go from being a thought to a thriving entity with a booster club. I mean, when they first started out, there was a-- And Hammond Noriega is another person. He works for--. Hammond Noriega works for the CRA. He’s over--. His office is in the Dupont Plaza. This started out with him initially saying he wanted to teach soccer to some kids. And he worked with a few of the men when they came up with, “We’re going to do this Optimist thing,” with very, very few funds. They one year got some funds from the city, but because of inexperience, there was not a whole lot of accountability. Not because anybody was stealing any money. They just didn’t know what to do. So it’s come from being that kind of organization to a situation where the parks are packed during the football season with people rooting for the Overtown team. And prior to them being there, kids from Overtown would catch the bus to Miami Beach to play--to play in their Optimist League. And if you can imagine these same kids catching the bus back after practice, getting home very late at night, tired, dirty, because they wanted to play. Now they play in their own neighborhood. So, it’s gone from--from nothing to something because some people have said, “Enough. We’re going to do this and we’re going to do it in our neighborhood.” So I believe it will happen. I--I believe that the government will tend to respond to people. I don’t think that the government will be the driving force behind it. I Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  34  think some folks are going to dig in their heels and say, “We’re not going to tolerate this anymore.” A few residents have been real boisterous up in their office about lighting. In fact, Norma, who I told you about speaking to, is one of those who said, “I know now that you have a responsibility. I know now that there’s a difference between the county streets and the state streets. And I need to talk to the county about this street and the state about that street. You know, I know now.” And I believe that once we get to more of, “I know you have a responsibility to maintain my unit. I know now.” Things will change. I’m real optimistic about it.  AR: And you’ve seen--? You’ve actually seen--?  SB: I’ve seen it.  AR: That’s great.  SB: I’ve seen it.  AR: You know, I’ve read here and there that ( ) the media gives( ) there’s an article here saying that--that Overtown is starting to ( ) there’s never sincereness about it. You know, there’s a web page that you can go to. And you click on the one for Little Havana and it’s pretty big. And then you go into the Overtown one and it’s just a paragraph, and it just says that, a great history, ( ), and it’s on it’s way up. But there’s no, you know--.  SB: [laughing]  AR: You know, there’s nothing more there.  SB: Yeah.  AR: So--.  Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  35  SB: Even the Overtown shopping center has gone from being just a grocery store. So now it has a grocery store, it has a beauty salon, a laundry-mat, a bank, a net office is located there, and something else, so it’s--it’s thriving. First of all, nobody else has got a bank open. And you know, and at the time with public banks there, we believe they can make it there. And they’ve been there for a number of years now. And they said to everybody that they were going to close down after the first year. They’re still there. So, you see some change. And then once--. You know, once people start to work in Overtown, they tend to see things differently. Some things are still a tad bit unbelievable, because--.  AR: Like, um--.  SB: When I go in some of these units, you would think that maybe you were in some Third World country. They clearly--. And they--. Code restrictions, code enforcement, that this would not occur--that this would not. And then you go there and it’s like, well how can this be? How did it happen? You know, and then how is it still happening? Yeah, I’ve gone in some of these grocery--these little corner grocery stores. I went in to buy once, we. You know, I said, I’m going to support the corner grocery store. We’re going to have an event in Overtown, so we needed some salad dressing. Well, the salad dressing was outdated by three years. And I’m saying, where is the regulatory aide that does the spot check to come in and say, you know, your salad dressing is three years old? Yeah. Then I went into the big grocery store. They sell you one pound. Why do you sell one pound? You can’t buy one pound for anywhere else. You know, why would you—one pound for fifty cents. What can you do with one pound for fifty cents. And then why would you even buy into that? And there literally was a band with one pound. Now there’s some stores you can go in and you can buy one cigarette. That’s illegal. So how do they continue to have them that way? You know, but it’s--it’s that kind of thing that goes on in Overtown that makes you feel, I’m not even in America any more. I can’t be. There are regulations against this kind of stuff. And you can call it naiveness or, you know, whatever, but the rules have got to be applied equally, you know. Clearly some people would be displaced if they really did code enforcement, because many of those apartment units would be closed. There was one apartment building that, various times during the year, raw sewage would back up--. [Tape cuts off] Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  36  [END OF SIDE 1]  [START OF SIDE 2]  AR: This is Aldo Regalado continuing the June 18, 1999, interview with Mrs. Sabrina Baker-Bouie at her TACOLCY office. The time is 11:01, and we are beginning side two of tape two. And, so go ahead.  SB: The owner told them that it had to do with the pumping station. That from time to time the county would close the valves on the pumping station, and that’s why the sewage backed up into their--their units. So as I was talking to this woman and she was giving this explanation, I said to her, “Clearly the county would not do that because they know it would create an unsanitary health condition for you. That has nothing to do with the pumping station.” She’s like, “It doesn’t?” “No, it doesn’t. This has to do with this building right here, because the pumping station, if that was the case, it would affect the whole, you know, region from--from the point that the sewage goes out to Virginia Key back, and everybody would have that problem.” So, it’s that kind of knowledge that--that it’s just not there, and not knowing where to go for help, or what to say, or what to do. And it is advantageous for some people to keep people with a lack of knowledge.  AR: It almost sounds like that’s the type of thing that should be taught in schools over some other stuff--.  SB: Yeah.  AR: You know, the process, the way--.  SB: It should be. It really should be. We’re starting to do it here at this center, having children understand the process. We--. You know, even with my experience in Overtown, it just dawned on me, we need to do that here. We need to start with the little ones. Let’s talk about responsibilities. Let’s talk about planning. Let’s talk about respect for property. Yeah, we’re Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  37  starting now, but it needs to be done on much larger scale than what we’re doing here. And just the whole session on rights, so that the kids can go home and say, “Mama, you know, we’re not supposed to have that stuff in our bathtub. Mama, you know, we can call this number because the building is not supposed to have all of these roaches in it.” I went into one apartment building that--I didn’t realize for a while, like, what all this stuff on the walls? It was--. The place was filled with roaches, and they were crawling all over the walls. And I thought, “That’s not supposed to be here.����� She said, “Well we set off a bomb.” I said, “Well, how you get this many roaches back here even with the--with, you know--with the--with the Raid, the bomb?” She said, “Well what happens when you set off the bomb, you kill a few of them and then they come back, because the other people.” And I said, “You either buy everybody a bomb and ya’ll set off the bomb at the same time. You all can’t be in here.” You know, you can’t sleep in this kind of place with all these roaches crawling all over you at night. And then, there are many units over there with no refrigerator, no stove. There was an article done a few years back, where the bulk of the apartment buildings over there, they don’t come with appliances. So imagine you already with a low income. Now where’re you going to buy a stove from? So, a lot of families cook on--on hot-plates. Now, would you think that you were in the big city of Miami, and you’re seeing people out on the little patio, cooking on a hot-plate? I don���t think so. So, that’s what I mean by you get the feeling that sometimes that you’re really in a Third World country.  AR: Okay. Well, I guess, since were on the last half of--the last quarter of--.  SB: [laughing] Of the tape?  AR: Of the tape that I have. I should ask you a couple of questions about other types of public spaces.  SB: Okay.  AR: And, I don’t know how much you’ll have to say. But let’s say--. We were talking about parks. Let’s go to schools, I guess. Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  38  SB: Okay.  AR: Schools and how--how they function in terms of--in Overtown--in terms of programs, in terms of activities, in terms of making the kids aware of the community. Where is that, right now, would you say?  SB: I think it depends upon the school. There are some schools in Overtown that are much more aggressive than others, largely because of the principal and the push that the principal makes.  AR: Which are some of ( )?  SB: Phyllis Wheatly used to be for a while. That Diane Pascal, who became Principal of the Year. And I said to her, “While I’m happy that you got this award, I’m really hate that you got this award, because I believe they will move you.” And she said, “No they’re not going to move me.” And, yeah, they moved her.  AR: To where?  SB: For the first year, they moved her downtown to a School Board office. And then they moved her out to this new school that’s doing the Edison Project, somewhere, Reeves Elementary or something.  AR: Is it a higher income location? Or is it also a needy school? Or ( )? I mean, did they moved her to a perceived better area? Or did they--?  SB: Initially they moved her to a perceived better area, because she was down at the main offices doing an assignment. And then they moved her to an area that is slightly better than--might have been a few steps above better than Overtown. But at that time she--she had some really great workers. That’s why I checked on that Connie McKinney who works very closely with people in the Overtown neighborhood. There would--give you a whole host--you would Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  39  have too many people to interview. But she had a wonderful staff that was always out in the community, always talking about programs and activities. And you had the same thing at Dunbar, where Miss--I think her--Minnie--Minnie McNeil I believe her name was, who pushed the staff. Now, both of those principals are gone. And whether the new ones have got--. I understand that Phyllis Wheatley’s new one has the same level of aggressiveness about her. I’m not sure that happens in--in Dunbar. The problem with Douglas is the bussing situation. Bussing causes some--some disunity. Maybe I’m creating a word, but the cohesiveness in terms of it being a--a neighborhood school is not necessarily there for Douglas. And the principal was not as aggressive as--as the others in terms of outreach. Miss Pascal would put on her sneakers and walk the streets, talking to people. She would put on her sneakers and go out if there was a child that had been absent, and go and get that child from home and talk to the mother about why you can’t keep him home. Not every principal’s going to do that. So there are some schools that are more utilized than others.  AR: What sort of programs did she push, aside from outreach, in terms of being in touch of parents, but also in terms of--thinking in terms of field trips or--?  SB: She--she was really pushing environmental kind of projects. She had a community garden--excuse me--at her school, and they had become pals with a school in South Dade that had a community garden. So they did field trips to that school, and then that school was encouraged to come to Phyllis Wheatley. And then they do the usual tourist attraction kinds of field trips. But, she was more into beautification and--and making sure that the children were environmentally instilled. They had a enviro-cops program at that school, so she really wanted to make sure that they were aware of that. And then she wanted to make sure that they were aware of black history. So she promoted a lot of activities that would cause them to understand their history. And not just their history, but she had a quite a few Haitian children at that school, so she did a lot on cultural diversity as well. So it was a combination of programs.  AR: Do you think the schools--even these more dynamic schools--? Do you think they’re restricted in terms of budgetary concerns?  Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  40  SB: Oh yeah.  AR: So they could be doing a lot more?  SB: Yeah. They could be. And see the other thing with that school was one Thanksgiving, someone went in and stole all of the computers. Now budget-wise, she had to wait until the next school year came to replace those computers. Well, if you’re in--. When you’re trying to deal with priorities, if you think I purchased the computers this year and then I build on that the next year by purchasing something else, and then keep building, when you’re not building, you’re still replacing. So you���re not advancing, you’re just maintaining. And many of the schools suffer from--from that particular problem. The crack epidemic in Overtown is a very serious epidemic. People will understand their points of education, but when they’re trying to feed a habit, you know, stealing your computer--. They stole the computers, every telephone, the typewriters, everything. And so the schools are not building, you know, they’re replacing.  AR: In that, has there been any--any progress in terms of ( ) gotten worse ( )?  SB: I’m sure it’s gotten worse. Many of those schools are old schools. So when you start to even deal with the security systems, you know, it doesn’t work. And some of the things Miss Pascal wanted to do at the time, in terms of, like, putting a chain on the door and locking, that’s against the code. So, you know, you--. It’s almost like, well, what can you do? You know, the buildings are old buildings. They can’t be--. Yes, it could be suited for an alarm. It just would be very expensive. So what do you do?  AR: [pause] How about ( )?  SB: [laughing]  AR: But, okay. How about--how about--? You mentioned briefly--I think it was Gibson Park that had the library. What about libraries as--as public spaces in Overtown? Are there--Are Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  41  there enough of them? Are there--Are there a lot of them? And how well are they attended and used?  SB: That library’s very well used. In fact, they, at the time, were doing a lot of activities down there, storytelling there. And primarily it was used in the afternoons by the kids coming in and looking through books. On Saturdays, occasionally they have activities. Puppet shows and--and those kinds of programs. It’s a very small space, so you can’t get a whole bunch of people in there. But, it is very well used.  AR: You know, here’s a question that just popped into my mind. I guess living--living in--people living in a lower-income area might not have a lot of the--the luxuries that--that middle class families have, in terms of television or video games or that sort of thing. Would you say that the kids, then, are more receptive to using places, you know, to finding entertainment in places like libraries that are public, that are there, and you know, and in terms of like, reading competency and stuff? Would you say that--that these kids are ( ) into that now? And why not? What are the obstacles there?  SB: A lot of kids have reading deficiencies. And so although they--they may not have some of the other--  AR: Distractions.  SB: --distractions, you know, they might go in and look--look through a book. But many of the children in Matheson and Overtown and Liberty City as well, have severe reading deficiencies. There’re some cases where you’re two and three grade levels behind. So you may have, you know. Say for example, with it being a small library, if you have twenty or thirty kids in there you would definitely know if you had that many kids in there. I mean, you’d be able to see them all, because it is that small. So you’re not channeling a--a large number of kids there. But the children tend to make other ways of entertaining themselves. They come up with--with games like throwing the bottle. And they just throw bottles at each other, which is dangerous. Or, you Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  42  know, other little mischievous kinds of games that they come up with to entertain themselves. But not, you know, let’s go to the library and get a book. That’s not it.  AR: Do you think libraries could be doing more to draw kids in? Or do you think it’s a product of the general environment? And if you can talk about the impact the environment has on--on everybody. Why do you think, you know--. Why do you think this reading deficiency is a problem with the schools?  SB: It’s a combination of problems with schools and a problem with homes. Many of the parents have dropped out, and so they’re not able to sit and read with the kids, provide that extra support. And many of the schools are dealing with behavior problems and classroom size. So there’s not a whole lot of time to devote to, you know, just pure reading. And then a lot of it is a lack of interest from the kids. For my son at home, I have to find stuff that he likes to read, which may cost me a bit more money. But my goal is to have him reading, so I have to go out of my way to get the--. He’s outgrown the Goosebumps series and now he’s into something else. So if you want them to read, you have to get stuff that they like to read. Your--your books and materials need to be updated. You cannot have stuff that is outdated on your shelves and expect children to be excited about it. I think the libraries could do a lot more. I think computers would help a lot. Many of the children, in fact, I don’t know of any of the children in Overtown that have computers at home. Now they might have TV’s and VCR’s, but they don’t have a computer at home. So if there was a whole focus on just the computer and what you can do with it, and even a whole thing on the Internet, on how it--it’s a--what do you call it, down--download video games, you know, and have that access. You’re getting them still involved with--with understanding how the computer works. But you’re making it fun and entertaining at the same time. So there--there could be a whole lot more. And then we have to reach the kids to where they are. You know, if we--we want them to read we can--. And they like rap music. Let’s rap the book, you know. Let’s talk them through the book through rapping, you know. And then tell them, challenge them to go and read the book and come back with their own rap song. You know, so it’s the motivation. We cannot--. We’re not going to be able to reach these kids with traditional mechanisms, you know, or traditional values, or “It’s nice to do that, because you will learn.” That--that’s not what happens. Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  43  AR: [pause] What about other--. Are there any other public spaces that we haven’t talked about that are used by--by the residents of Overtown? Beaches, zoos, community ( ), that stuff, or anything else that I have not--?  SB: One of things that was kind of curious to me is that many of the residents from Overtown have not gone to Bayside or that whole Bayfront Park area. And I made the assumption early on that because it was so close, that, for sure, they had been there. We took a group of kids on a field trip to Bayside and found out that was their first time being there. And at that point I started to ask different people, and they said “No, we really don’t go to Bayside.” And I thought, it’s such a beautiful space there, why not? They didn’t feel welcome. And, we don’t have any money to go, so we don’t go. So a lot of the outside spaces, unless the children have done it with a field trip or you have, you know, a few parents who, like, take the extra time to go to something like a Metro Zoo--. There’s not been a whole lot of exposure to Metro Zoo. There’re not, like, family trips to the beach either. During the summer, they have the pool in the neighborhood, so many of the kids go to the pool. Every now and then you’ll find a family that has gone to Haulover for a picnic, primarily on holidays, not just like for, you know, “It’s Saturday afternoon; let’s go to the beach” kind of activity. So, what I found in working with many of the residents, unless it’s the open spaces within their current environment, there’s not a lot of--of branching out and going other places. Movies is one of the things that was entertaining, but not public open spaces. And then even within the Omni area, there’s a park right behind the Omni. There’s a very nice park right on the water, but it’s not used.  AR: And, so you mentioned the sense of not--inequality being one of issues behind the--. Were there any others ( )?  SB: Transportation.  AR: Transportation?  SB: Transportation is a really big issue. If you’re going to spend money to go somewhere, you need to be influenced on where you need to go. So, I guess the transportation and the money Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  44  might be linked. It needs to take you right there. And there’s no Metrorail that will take you to the Zoo. And even to go the beach, it’s several buses to go to the beach. And that’s what I assumed with Bayside, which is in walking distance, for sure. And--and that had not occurred. So they’re obstacles to getting to those--those places that people just don’t see as a priority. Then when you--when you start to really evaluate priorities, being in some of these really nice public spaces that have appeared in this county, this is not a priority, in the scheme of things. Saturday is normally wash day, you run your errands day, clean up the house day. And that’s every Saturday. And when you’ve finished, you’re tired. Sunday is normally church day. The whole day is devoted to church and dinner. Then that’s the end of that. Then in the weekday, you’re back to your normal routine of a weekday. So it’s not like we have this extra hobby, you know, time to go and explore, you know, new things to do or learn more about Dade County. It’s--. Most stuff is with a purpose.  AR: This is not really related, but it’s something--. You mentioned church, and when I was talking with ( ) a few days ago, we were talking about a lot of these issues, and he said, the problems ( ). There isn’t as much church--. The church has become--. That it has moved away from being the center of a lot of people’s lives. And I was wondering if you would agree with that statement?  SB: Uh-huh. I would.  AR: And, why so? Why do you think that’s been the case?  SB: A lot of people believe that the church has not been supportive, and the church does not meet their needs. And although Sunday I said was church day, not everybody was going to church. It’s still just church day. It’s the frame of mind, you know. But many people are not in churches. And most of the churches in Overtown are not filled with people from Overtown. Most of the people in those churches come from other neighborhoods to go to church. And most of the ministers will tell you, “My congregation is not made up of residents of Overtown.”  Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  45  AR: And--and what would you say that the--the community is looking for the churches to provide that they don’t provide? And why do you think they’re not providing it?  SB: The community’s wanting more outreach, more services that they need: tutorial services in the afternoon; shelter; feeding programs. And--and what they’ve said is, “How’re you going to tell me you’re going to minister to me and you don’t even know what I need?” Many of the ministers say that their congregations, because they’re from outside of the community, are not interested in spending all of their money right there, because they’re not from there. So, some of the churches have moved past that. Like Greater Bethel has moved past that, and they have a lot of outreach ministries. Mt. Zion has moved past that. But many churches in Overtown, after the service, the last service on Sunday, that’s it. They’re closed until Wednesday when they have prayer meeting or choir rehearsal or something. And then they’re open for that, and then they’re closed. So those are not inviting spaces. You know, a couple of the--. St. Agnes is another one that has done some outreach, and St. John’s. Both of them have day cares. So they’re providing a service to the community with--with offering a day care facility. But the bulk of the churches in Overtown are not providing a service to Overtown residents.  AR: [pause] Yeah, that’s um, so--so you mean--. When we mentioned these outreach programs in some of these other churches. Some of the more--. The churches--. You mentioned day care. Any other activities or, yeah, or community ( )?  SB: One has a Head Start. One--two of them have tutorial programs. One has a computer program. Greater Bethel used to serve--and Mt. Zion--meals on the weekends. Greater Bethel, I believe, has a clothing bank for residents. Greater Bethel has an AIDS outreach ministry. St. Agnes has bought a couple apartment buildings that they--they are the managers of, and so they’re big into housing. [pause] So, it varies. It varies.  AR: But--but, yeah, they’re definitely oriented at the physical needs of the community ( ). But would you say that there’s--. You mentioned, I think Bethel, having set up programs. Would you say that there is enough communication between the communities, organizations, schools, churches to make a concerted effort, or--?  Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  46  SB: No.  AR: ( ).  SB: No. A lot of the entities or institutions within the community--and much of it might be because of time or an established vehicle for communicating--but they don’t operate outside of their--their institution. And there’s not necessarily mechanisms to connect, you know, what you’re doing at your institution with what I’m doing at my institution, and--and dealing with collaboration. It’s just, ���Let me try to survive right here. I’m overwhelmed with what I’m trying to do here, and there’s not much more I can give to include a conversation with you.” We did, at one point, brought all of the community development corporations in Overtown together. And that was the first real conversation that they had had. And I was like, well this is great, we did it over lunch. And we thought, well golly, maybe we could bring the churches together. Maybe we could bring this group. And, you know, you need someone who’s really charged with the communication vehicle to get people to talk and--and get them involved with each other. And there’s not that person or that entity there. So, you know, “I may have learned what you’re doing at your church, because someone from your church stopped by,” or you know, “We saw each other at a meeting.” But there’s no deliberate mechanism for communicating.  AR: Do you think--? [pause] We talked a little--. We talked a lot about the physical ( ) of the community. Do you think that’s the road? Again we’re not talking ( ). They were really talking about a spiritual vacuum that they think exists. Do you think that solving that first physical--that physical need is a priority and a way of starting to address the spiritual vacuum, if indeed such a vacuum exists? Yeah, I guess I’m asking if that’s a priority.  SB: Oh yeah. You’re not going to get the people interested in anything spiritually until you at least address one of the physical needs. Unless they have a crisis. That tends to be one where people start to deal with their spiritual needs is when you’ve had a crisis, and it’s like, “Okay, now I need God.” But if you’re going to really make a difference, you’re going to have to deal with the physical needs. Many people don’t want to deal with it, because the spiritual--the physical needs are great. And if you’re going to get involved with it, you can’t, like, halfway get Sabrina Baker-Bouie  June 18, 1999  47  involved with it. You’re either going to do it, or you should really leave the whole thing alone. And many people prefer to leave the whole thing alone, because it can be overwhelming. Some of the stuff is just, like I said to you, it’s unbelievable. So, you just stand there, and you feel helpless. “I have no solution. I have no clue. I need to go.” You know, and then you back to what is safe for you. “Well, if you’re going to try to talk to me about my spiritual growth and development, when I’m trying to figure out how to feed these kids, we can’t talk right now. You know, we really can’t talk.” When we started to go through, and as you read through the book, you know ask folks to establish what their priorities were, I though housing was going to be like, in the top one. And under that, “Give me a job. If you’d just give me a job, I could take care of my housing problem. I don’t want to have anything else but a job.��� I thought health care would be like a primary issue. And everything was equated with, “If I can work, I can take care of those other issues. Right now, I just need a job.” And so, employment was like the top priority. Well, when you come into a neighborhood and you don’t have the jobs to offer, really there’s not too much you’re going to be able to talk about. And you know you don’t have the jobs. And you know you’re not going to be able to, you know, pay for this family’s food forever, or put this family in some good housing conditions, or provide clothing for the kids forever. So you just leave the whole thing alone. And you say, “I’m going to pray for you.”  AR: Well, I think we are one second away from ending, so the tape’s about to run out--.  SB: [laughing] Okay.  AR: So thank you so very much.  SB: You’re welcome.  AR: It’s been a wonderful interview.  SB: I really enjoyed it.  AR: [laughing] Okay.

Interview with Sabrina Baker-Bouie			Baker-Bouie, Sabrina	Regalado, Aldo J.			1999-06-18	Miami, Florida	Although the interview was to deal primarily with parks and other public spaces, Ms. Baker-Bouie broadened the scope of the session to include a discussion of the Overtown neighborhood as a whole, while still maintaining the focus of the interview. She puts forth that public spaces are tied to housing, neighborhood maintenance, community services, education, and countless other factors, which have to be dealt with and considered as a whole. In terms of public spaces, Ms. Baker-Bouie talks extensively about Gibson Park and Dorsey Park, with some mention of Range Park and the smaller mini-parks that pervade the community. She also talks about crime, police, community programs, and the community’s political history.

It is July 16th, 1999 and we are beginning the interview at 8:49. The topics of discussion will be public space issues, the neighborhood, and Mr. Canton’s work with the NET office in general. I’ll place this over here so we could get you on tape easier. Okay, I’m going to start off just asking you for about five minutes some of your background information, where you grew up and all of that. So let’s just begin from the beginning, what’s your date of birth and where were you born?  Pablo Canton: Okay, November 25, 1945 I was born in Havana, Cuba. I came to the United States on August 27, 1961. I went to high school in Havana in LaSalle High School. I finished here also in LaSalle in 1962. Later on I went to Miami-Dade Community College. I went to the University of Miami. I have a Bachelor of Business Administration degree from the University of Miami in 1969. I went to the Army for a couple of years, active Army as a first lieutenant infantry 101st airborne division. I went to Vietnam 1970 to 1971. After I came back from the service I worked for an insurance company, Liberty Mutual, as a claims adjustor for five years. In the meantime, I went back to school and I got another degree, Bachelor of Science in Construction Management from Florida International University. I was involved in construction for several years. I worked for different companies, M. R. Harrison, Edward J. Gerrits, and I was on my own also for a couple of years. I started to work with the City of Miami in June 14, 1987. I started in the Department of Community Development, Association Director, in charge of some of the construction including the Manuel Artime that was going through some remodeling. I was also in charge of festivals, special events, and another section called Citizen Response where people would call with all kinds of complaints and we would refer it to different departments. That’s the system we had back then on complaints. People would call Citizen Response and we would refer the complaint to the other department. Later on I was involved with the problem of crack houses, very much involved with demolition. And then City Manager Cesar Odio transferred me from Community Development to Building and Zoning and in charge of code enforcement and that was in 1989, October 1989. At that time I was in charge of a group of about twenty-some people including the inspectors, code-enforcing inspectors, and we targeted specifically abandoned buildings. At the time that I was there, we averaged about one demolition a day, over one a day because there were more than three hundred and sixty-five demolitions a year. I was there for about two and a half years. In 1992 when the NET concept was started, they took the inspectors, Pablo Canton  July 16, 1999  July 22, 1999  3  code-enforcing inspectors, and sent them out to the different areas. That’s when they divided the city in eleven different areas, because we had eleven inspectors, that’s the reason they divided in eleven. And I was given the position of NET administrator and given the choice as to where I wanted and I chose Little Havana. At the time Little Havana was only one big area and a couple of years later, back in 1994, the City Manager decided it was too big and in order to give the people in the area better service, he divided the area in two: East and West. Then again, I decided to stay in the East and have been working with the NET in the East since 1994, as a matter of fact, since the inception in 1992. And as you know, the NET actually is a governmental office. We all work for the City of Miami, all the employees are from the City of Miami and we try to improve the quality of life of the people in the area. That’s basically our main purpose at the NET office.  AR: So, Little Havana, or East Little Havana, the choice for you, why did you make that choice?  PC: Well, at the time when they started dividing the city, I figured Little Havana, I won’t say grew up in Little Havana, but when I arrived from Cuba, that is where I lived. I lived right here on Second Avenue and Southwest Seventh Street. Again, looking at the whole city itself I couldn’t find a better place than Little Havana to work at. Now, when they divided the area into two, I considered East Little Havana to be a little bit more challenging, a little bit more problematic than the West, and I liked that. I’m not here just to have a nice time or enjoy the position, but I’m here to try to make a difference in the area and that’s why I chose East Little Havana.  AR: So I have two questions from that statement. One, you said that you found, I mean, you couldn’t think of a better place to work. What made it the best place to work? And the second question is, when you mentioned that East Little Havana seemed more challenging, what were the reasons it was more challenging?  PC: More problems, you know. As a matter of fact, I had choices of going to many other areas. As a matter of fact, a year and a half ago when we had the change of leadership in the commission, I was kind of ordered to go to Flagami. Again, Flagami, compared to East Little Havana, is like talking about Coral Gables. There’s not much going on in Flagami, they don’t Pablo Canton  July 16, 1999  July 22, 1999  4  have that many problems in Flagami. I definitely did not like the change. A lot of the people in the area were upset about it and they voiced their opinion. I voiced my opinion to my immediate supervisor and I guess I won. So I stayed here, you know. The reason I’m saying a little bit more challenging is common problems.  AR: What would you identify as the biggest problems then, when you made your choice in Little Havana, and how have they changed? And what are the biggest problems now?  PC: There are problems everywhere. There are problems in every part of the city, you’re going to find problems. Now, in some areas you have a little bit more than others. You have more homeless, you have more illegal units, you have more crime, you have more drugs, you have more of the negative things that can affect a neighborhood. I don’t think there’s any neighborhood in the City of Miami that is completely clean. They all have their little problems. But Little Havana is definitely one of the worst as far as, the amount of problems that we have in the area are definitely more than Flagami, and the Grove, and Shenandoah, Coral Way, or some other areas of the city. So that’s why we’re so busy here. Sometimes I don’t even have time to have lunch or go to the bathroom.  AR: From your perspective, the most progress you’ve made in the past seven years has been in what areas? And what is your next set of priorities?  PC: Well, we’ve always had priority number one as the crime situation. That’s the number one priority. We have two officers here, they’re called neighborhood resource officers, working together, from our office, together with the lieutenant. Now we have Lieutenant Mike Perez who is in charge of the police for the whole area. That’s priority number one. I don’t think any area can develop, any area can move forward until we can control the crime situation. The only way you can bring people to start investing in the area is if you have your streets under control. Otherwise, if you have homeless and you have people selling crack on the streets or whatever, the place is a dump, no one is going to invest into the area. And that’s what we had several years ago. Based on that, we have been pushing for more police protection. We have been pushing for the police to take more aggressive actions. I have my up and downs on convincing some of the police to be that aggressive. Some of them have been here for years and are used to doing some things Pablo Canton  July 16, 1999  July 22, 1999  5  the way they’re used to doing it and it’s just reactive. They will only take action when somebody calls for whatever reason, for a problem. Otherwise, most of these people, or mostly patrol officers will go by and they may be doing anything on the streets and if it’s not completely obvious that somebody is selling crack, or they have a little note saying “I’m selling crack” they will not stop, they will keep on going. So it’s been taking a while to get the aggressive effort to have the whole team in movement. We’ve had some success stories on getting specific specialized groups of officers to target this problem. Like right now, it’s the fifth month that we have a group of undercover officers, only six, but we have been able to talk to the police department and convince them of the need for additional police patrols and police action. So we have a group of six police undercover that have targeted specifically drugs and prostitution. They have done an excellent job and they are still working on it, hopefully they will be here for a few more months. This is something that cannot be eradicated from one day to the next. Big problem we’re having is we arrest them today, couple of hours later they’re out. Most of these people that we’re arresting don’t care, basically. It’s not like you and me that if we get arrested for whatever reason we think it’s the end of the world. We’re going to have to get an attorney and see how we can expunge the record because we don’t want to have anything negative in our record. But these people don’t care. They’ve been arrested on several occasions, numerous occasions. Most of them live on the streets. Most of them if you arrest them and they place them in jail for a couple of weeks or three weeks, you’re doing them a favor, because they have a place where they can eat and they can sleep. So the deterrent for some of these people is not there. They’re going to try to keep on selling drugs in order to feed their own habit and their own addiction. They don’t care about the system. They don’t care about law, they don’t care about justice. These are the same people that will mug, will burglarize, will break into a car, do anything to keep on feeding their addiction. So it’s not that easy, it’s very difficult. And the whole idea behind this whole thing is making their life difficult. I’m not saying impossible, but you could use that word too. The idea is, if they’re trespassing on private property, even if they’re not doing anything, they may just be sitting inside a lot, we have some empty lots around here, and some of them may just be sleeping under a tree, I’ve been telling the officers, and I’ve been doing it myself, I’m kicking them out. If they cannot produce that they’re the owners of that property, they cannot sleep in there. That’s private property, they cannot be there. Abandoned buildings, same thing. They cannot go in any of these buildings. I’m trying to get the police even to arrest some of these people. And I’ve had a little confrontation because we are not seeing eye to eye on this. The police, as I mentioned, don’t Pablo Canton  July 16, 1999  July 22, 1999  6  want to take these additional steps on arresting for trespassing on some of these private properties. So I had my due discussion there with some of the sergeants. Problems with shopping carts. Every month we pick a hundred and fifty shopping carts, an average of a hundred and fifty, sometimes more than that. I am also trying to get the police to start arresting people for possession of shopping carts, which is against the law. You cannot do that. We have been hitting the boatyards, the Haitian boatyards. They only have a license to load and unload the boat, they have no license to buy anything. So we’ve been hitting them for that. We’ve been giving them five hundred dollar fines for breaking the law. We are hitting the illegal units. Illegal units are bringing additional people into the area, people that are not paying taxes definitely. There’s usually a single family residential home, and they’re paying taxes for a single family and, in fact, they are using it as a multi-family duplex, triplex, or rooming house. That increases the amount of individuals in the area that are not counted on anything, as I mentioned, they are not paying the taxes you are supposed to for city services and still we have to provide them with services. Most of these locations are problem locations where you are not going to find families living in a rooming house. Only time you are going to see single men living in an illegal rooming house and most of them already have criminal records. So that’s not the type of people that we are trying to bring into the area. Rooming houses and illegal units are one of our top priorities. Last year we came with an ordinance which has helped at least with the exterior façade. It’s what they call the Commercial and Residential Façade Ordinance. Where before there was nothing we could do if the paint was chipping or the person has not been in his house for twenty years, there was not much we could do. Now we passed this ordinance and we have been enforcing it, sending letters to the people requesting these people take care of their buildings. And we’ve had great success and hundreds of properties that have been painted because we have been sending letters and kind of scaring them that we’re going to take them to court. And we will take some of them to court if they do not paint their homes or businesses. Again, one of the other successes that we’ve had is we’ve had a good rapport with the community. I hate to say that we are reactive, but to a certain degree we are. We use the community to be the ones that tell us what their priorities are. So we are constantly sending fliers, we are constantly talking to different people in the community telling them that anytime there is a problem to give us a call. We have fliers indicating that whenever they see a crime being committed either to call us or to call the police dispatcher with information so that we can send a police officer to handle it right away. Illegal units, same thing. We’re all telling people whenever they see something next door, or across the street, or whatever Pablo Canton  July 16, 1999  July 22, 1999  7  that doesn’t seem right, to give us a call. In other words, we are trying to enforce the law a hundred percent. That’s the motto of mine.  AR: You gave me a great sense of the problems, and the progress, and the community. How about in terms of parks, and I guess we can start with Jose Marti Park which we’re so close to, historically what has been the problems with parks? And you’ve been here since the Sixties so what are your recollections, if any, of the park back then and how has that developed over time?  PC: Well one of the big problems we have with parks I think, number one, Little Havana is the area with the least amount of parks in the whole city. We really don’t have enough parks in the area. We have them all concentrated here: Jose Marti Park, Riverside, and Henderson. Those are the only three that we have. But, they’re not that big and, as I mentioned, we are the area with the least amount of parks in the whole City of Miami. The problem that we have with parks is we do not have the funding. Every year, whenever the city is strapped for cash and we have to make cuts, the cuts are usually made in parks. We cut most of the maintenance in some of the parks. We do not have anyone at Henderson Park and Riverside Park. We send a maintenance crew every week. Now I’ve been able to convince them that they come in twice a week to clean the park. They’ll come in twice a week maybe for a couple of hours, they’ll clean the park, and they’ll leave. But we have no employee, no one that stays there and takes care of the park the whole day. We don’t have any programs in any of these parks. Except now in Jose Marti Park, yes we do have the summer program and the pool is open. But, there is nothing in Henderson, there is nothing in Riverside. We need more programs in these parks. We need to be able to have a soccer league, or basketball league, or baseball league, or so forth. Organized sports, or kids if they want to play, they can play and feel safe. At the same time with having an adult, responsible adult there in the park, without getting called or take action if something happens. Also these parks, as I mentioned, they’re all by themselves. Some parents are scared to send their kids over there. In the past several months, we have been able to clean up the parks a little bit from homeless because the law changed. November 1998 the law changed where it is illegal for anyone to be in a park after hours. In other words, most of the homeless that used to sleep at these parks cannot do that. That is another battle that I have been fighting with the police department, is to make sure that we keep the pressure and do not allow anyone to sleep in the park after hours. Some of these people before November 1998 had taken certain areas of the park and camped out, Pablo Canton  July 16, 1999  July 22, 1999  8  and there was nothing we could do back then. Now it’s against the law, so now we can kick them out. We can offer them help. I don’t want to sound too harsh and say kicking them out. We actually try to help these people and offer them help all of the time.  AR: In what way?  PC: Shelter. There’s not a single homeless in this area that has not been approached and offered shelter. Any homeless that we have in the area, they all know that there is a shelter that they can go to. They all know that they can come over here and we’ll refer them to a shelter. It’s just that some of them, most of the ones that are on the street right now, like that type of life and it is very difficult for them to go to a shelter and stay at a shelter. Some of them have tried, but some of these people do not want to abide by any [unclear]. They like the freedom of being on the street and being able to go to bed at anytime they want, or wake up at ten o’ clock in the morning if they want to, do drugs and prostitution, like some of them do. They cannot do that in shelters. It’s not as simple as people think, “take them to a shelter and put them to work”. It’s not that simple. Some of these people will not change their lifestyle for a normal lifestyle, that we consider normal: getting a job and working. They like the streets. They have been there, probably, for several years and it’s very difficult to break that routine, on addiction or prostitution, and get a job. A couple days ago, I had a male prostitute, a male transvestite that works as a prostitute right here on Flagler and Thirteenth Avenue, I talked to this guy on several occasions trying to make him change until finally, because of the many times that we have arrested this guy, the guy is kind of saying “I give up”. He came to look for help. He came to look for help to see what we could do to help him get a job. Number one, it is very difficult for this guy to get a job, even though he’s over six feet. But the mannerisms and so forth come right through. And this guy was actually looking for a job as a security guard. That’s going to be kind of rough. I told the guy, I said, “This is going to be a little difficult, I don’t think that it’s going to work.” As a prostitute she can probably make, or he can probably make a lot more money than any regular job. That’s the main problem with prostitution. We have several here that we have tried to help and there’s no way. It’s very difficult. I’m not saying it cannot be done but it is very, very difficult. All we can do is make their life difficult so they can find another area or, again hopefully, another trade. But the best we can do is just hit them once and once again and tell them we’re not going to allow prostitution or drugs in East Little Havana. Now, if they can get help, if they can get rehabilitated, Pablo Canton  July 16, 1999  July 22, 1999  9  if they can change their lifestyle, great. But the idea is to send them a message: “we do not want you here in East Little Havana, not as long as you are breaking the law”. And that’s what we have been trying. We have an area here we call Prototype, Prototype Area. We are trying to putting all our efforts into improving that particular area. Actually it’s north of Flagler and east of Twelfth Avenue. It’s like a triangle and the river is the other part of the border. We have placed signs encouraging people to call the police. We have passed out fliers in the area. We have concentrated our police effort into cleaning up the area. We have made hundreds of arrests. We have run into some of the houses where we know there is drug dealing and done full, complete inspections of the area. That’s another thing, whenever a police officer makes an arrest, for example, this one here, the reason I have it here is because I’m going to send a letter to the owner of where this guy lives. We want to make sure that the owners of these properties know who their tenants are. The main problem is that most of these people are arrested and nobody knows about it, not even their next door neighbors. But we want to make sure that at least the apartment building owner knows about it. I send them a little letter with a copy of the arrest warrant basically telling the guy who he has there. Most of the time, they get them out. Where do they go to? Hopefully some other area away from East Little Havana. Maybe West Little Havana, [unclear], I don’t care, the problem is to get them out of the area. We have been successful in this effort of getting rid of some of these people. You cannot keep them in jail forever, you cannot kill them, so the best you can do is just relocate them. In the past several months we have seen an improvement of the area. We have seen investors coming in, buying properties in the area. I have several investors that are coming from Miami Beach that are very interested in buying properties in East Little Havana. And they have bought properties in East Little Havana. These people, and I do too, they believe that there’s going to be a boom in construction in the East Little Havana area, and not very far away. That is already started. We have seen some of this construction going up and already started and some of these people are actually aggressively buying everything that they can find for a good price.  AR: Construction you mean mostly in terms building businesses and that sort of thing?  PC: Buying apartment buildings, buying businesses on Eighth Street. I know there’s one that all he wants to do is buy properties on Eighth Street. He won’t look at anything else, he would just Pablo Canton  July 16, 1999  July 22, 1999  10  buy on Eighth Street. I’m talking about a guy that had millions of dollars. He had purchased several properties on Eighth Street and that’s all he was looking for.  AR: What do you see the future of parks in this if—you mentioned Little Havana has so little parks now—do you see provisions being made to use some of the space for—?  PC: Right now, the future of parks in the area, talking about Henderson. I don’t think there is much that is going to happen in Henderson Park. As you know Henderson is not that big. Most likely the only thing that we’re going to do is probably fence the park. We already had a children’s playground installed there several months ago. Hopefully we’ll have some programs in the park and that would be something that I would also like to see in Henderson. Riverside Park, as you have been reading in the paper, the Ada Meritt School is going to be—actually construction should have already started. They haven’t, but hopefully they will start construction, and they will take over the park. They do not have enough space at the site and they want to use the park also for the kids. It’s an elementary school and what they’re going to do is get rid of the street actually, of the avenue, which is actually Seventh Avenue, and make Riverside part of the school. It will be kept as a public park, it’s not going to be used specifically for the kids in the school. We will do some kind of a contract with the school board where the kids will be able to utilize the park during the daytime and then after school hours it is a public park and anyone can use it. I think it’s going to be good for the city, be good for the area. Hopefully the school may have some after school programs at the park and it could be utilized a little better. The only problem we have right now is by a gentleman that has been doing this for twenty years. He has a little baseball league. Kids from ten to fourteen years old, they play baseball there and he takes care of the diamond, the baseball diamond. Other than that there’s not much been going on in the park. We also placed a children’s playground about seven or eight months ago in Riverside. Now, as far as Jose Marti Park. Jose Marti is the biggest one of all the parks that we have in the area. We have some monies to expand and buy some additional land to make the park bigger. Some people, including Sally Jude who has the Miami River Inn and has the property right across from the park, she wants to see the park extended to the north. In other words, we have a [unclear] and a big waterfront. She still wants to extend the waterfront area. Big problem because, number one, the man who has the business there does not want to sell, we cannot take over the property as eminent domain. All we can do is just offer him, you know— Pablo Canton  July 16, 1999  July 22, 1999  11  [Tape Breaks]  AR: This is Aldo Regalado interviewing Mr. Pablo Canton in his East Little Havana NET office.

It is June 4th, 1999 and I am at Lummus Park located in Miami, Florida at Northwest Third Avenue and Second Street. Today I will be interviewing Officer Joe Triana who works at the park as a mounted police officer. The focus of the interview will be public space issues as well as history of the neighborhood, or the neighborhoods that Officer Triana has lived and worked in. Okay, Officer Triana, thank you so much for doing this today. Let’s start off with some questions about your background and your early life. Could you tell me when and where you were born?  Joe Triana: Okay. I was born in Cuba, Santa Clara, Cuba. I relocated here to the United States when I was three years old back in 1960, September 1960. Came over with my parents and we relocated up to New Jersey, Union City, New Jersey back then. I grew up there. My educational background is elementary school, [and] then I went to high school, Union Hill High School. From there I developed an interest in architecture. I was going to school, taking up drafting in high school and that was my interest there. So, I went to NYIT, New York Institute of Technology, and I took up architectural engineering. But, weather-wise, the weather was kind of cold up there so I came down a couple of times to vacation in Miami, Florida and I loved it. So, after one year of my college up there, NYIT, I said, “Well, let me try moving down to Florida and see how it is down in Miami.” So, I moved down here. I was about nineteen years old. I enjoyed the weather. I was going to the beach every day with the sun. It was beautiful. Sunsets and all that compared up to New York, all the grey skies and gloomy days. So I said, “Well, this is where I’m going to live.” At that time I enrolled in the University of Miami and I couldn’t attend because financially-wise I wasn’t set to go to that school. So, I attended Miami-Dade. [I] graduated from Miami-Dade with an AA and an AS in Aviation Administration and Business Administration. Then I continued my studies in FIU. I was there for about a year in FIU, took up business administration, then from there again financially-wise. Then there was an opening for a police officer. I said, “Well, let me try police work see how it is. I like working out there in the streets out with the public.” So I said, “Let me try it and see how that career goes.” I applied, they called me in, I took the test, I passed the test, I passed the interview, took the physical test and all of that, and I Joe Triana 3  June 4, 1999  became a police officer. And right now that’s where I stand and it’s great. I went to the police academy and I’ve been on for about sixteen years now with the police department. I did nine and a half years of street patrol which is very fulfilling educational-wise. You see a lot of things that a normal person does not see. You have to deal with the worst and the good part of daily life. That’s what’s good about this job. You really see how life is out there dealing with these people. It’s rewarding, you have it good and you have it bad, but it’s rewarding. You learn. Sometimes you have to be a father, a mother, a psychologist, a doctor, and you have to give advice to people. The rewarding part about this job is when you help them. You deal with them, and you help them out, and you sort out their problems. And then what’s good is when you see them maybe a week, or maybe a month later down the road they go, Oh, Officer Triana! How are you doing? Remember what I did? I took your advice. I went here and I went there and it went great and now I’m doing this. Thank God that you gave me this advice. And after you’ve had that little talk and you go away you say, Wow, that’s good that at least I helped somebody and they accomplished something. You get some people off the streets. You know, big drug problem. Not all of them, but at least if you get one person, one drug addict off the street, set their mind on a good path. You know, you find them a job or something, which is good. Unfortunately, the women that work on the streets are prostitutes. Everybody has their difficulties in life. Everybody has their ups and downs along life. Some get hit harder than others. When you find a person like that, you talk to them. And some of them, believe it or not, are very educated people. They’re very smart. But it happens, they have this trauma in life that either they have some personal problem which traumatizes them, or financial problem where they can’t really get up back on their feet. You just help them out and talk to them and hopefully they accomplish something and they go on the right direction. One out of a whole lot takes that advice and it works out for them. That’s rewarding. That’s what the job is about. That’s why I feel good about this job. I said that was nine and a half years of street patrol then I went into the mounted patrol. I was interested. I said, “Well, let me see the mounted patrol. That’s dealing with animals, horses. Great.” Like I said, I grew up in Jersey, the New York area, which, really, there’s Joe Triana 4  June 4, 1999  [are] not a lot of farms up there. It’s city life. So, I said, “Well, that’s an interest, let me try it.” So, like I said, I applied for the unit, I was selected, I went to interviews, and there I was. I was there, they called me. And I started a new direction here working with animals and all of that, with horses. And it was interesting at first learning how to ride; I took my good falls because I never rode a horse. I developed my riding skills and all this, like they say now, horsemanship, which was great, you learn about that. And you get close to your animal. When they give you your horse you’ve got to groom them and you have to bond with them so you get used to them. It’s like a dog, the horse is a little bit bigger, but you have a bond. And it’s interesting because when you have such a big animal next to you like that, and they see that you’re the person who’s taking care of them, they trust you that you’re going to help them and take care of them so they really get close to you.  AR: How long have you been doing the mounted patrol specifically?  JT: Well, the mounted patrol, I’ve been on now for about seven years with the mounted patrol. And it’s great because what’s good about this unit is normally you go into the inner city. Kids there don’t normally see a horse on a daily basis. And when you go to the schools on a presentation and you show them this horse, this animal, and they come out of the trailer, their eyes open up like, Wow, look how big that thing is. They’ve never seen a horse before. And it’s great, at first they’re scared, but then you talk to them, and you make them relax, and you make them come up, and tell them a little bit about your horse and your job, what you do and then you bring them up and tell them, Come on touch him, don’t be scared. And they’ll start touching him on the nose, on the side of the body, and they feel more relaxed. You can see them more relaxed and they enjoy that. And next thing you know, when you finish your presentation, they’re saying, Oh, I’m going to go visit you when I grow up, I want to have a horse, I want to ride a horse, and this and that. Which is good, at least you give them a little education. It’s tradition, in a sense, because nowadays you don’t see too many horses out in the streets. And it’s tradition to go back in time, in other words, and showing them how it was back then. Joe Triana 5  June 4, 1999  How it was when they didn’t have automobiles. Sometimes they ask me, “How was it back then?” For transportation they had horses and they used to do this. They had carriages. To the stores, they would go in horse and carriage, or if you wanted to go somewhere they had a horse and carriage like a taxi. You go in the carriage, it would take you somewhere, and that’s how it used to be back then. You give them a little insight in that and they wonder; they’re there like, Wow. It’s great.  AR: Which schools do you normally go to and do you get to do these presentations often?  JT: These presentations, I go to private schools, I got to inner city schools, I go to public schools. I go to all schools. When they call on us, we go to them. It’s in City of Miami, and also we do out in the area like Dade County. We also go out to schools out in Dade County and we do presentations.  AR: How about in terms of your actual patrols? Do you basically stick to the park or do you go beyond it? What neighborhoods do you frequent, your patrol?  JT: Right now, I’ve worked almost all the neighborhoods in our beat, in our section. Let’s say for example, right now I’m assigned to, I just came over this month to this park, Lummus Park. This beat here, it’s considered Riverside now. It’s a new opening, a new beat that opened up and it’s considered like Downtown beat. So what I do is I come here, and because it���s a park we have shade trees and all of that. We trailer in the horses. We set up with the horses. Get them ready, tacked, put the saddles on and everything. Then we go out to the Downtown area, that’s a beat. Downtown, Bayside, or Bayfront Park. And then from there we have now, like I said, we have the Riverside beat which is a very historical—I’ll get to that in a minute. And the beat is along the river. It’s called River Drive. And then we ride up and down River Drive along here. It’s very nice. The people here, we have several buildings which are for the retired, for the elderly. And they enjoy when we go stop there and talk to them, see how everything is working out with them, make sure they’re safe. And let them know that we’re in the area and anything they need, Joe Triana 6  June 4, 1999  we’re here. So, that’s good and we have a good rapport with them. The merchants, we also have merchants along the river here. We have fishermen that have been here for many, many years. Then the restaurants, too, that bring in the lunch time people from the Downtown area, brings in the crowd. And it’s good because when they see an officer on horseback at least they see somebody and they feel more safe. They feel protected, at least, in a sense, and they enjoy their stay around here in the area.  AR: Could you give me a sense of—maybe be more specific about some of these merchants or the restaurants in terms of, are there any longstanding businesses or that sort of thing, or businesses or merchants that make a particular contribution to the area?  JT: Well, yes, we have, like I said, Riverside here, we have merchants that have been here for many years.  AR: Any particular names?  JT: We have an East Coast Fishery. We have Garcia Seafood. And as you go down the road we have the City of Miami Administrative Office down the road, which contains all of the administrative offices of the City of Miami. Also, we keep on going we have residents that have been here for many years, which contribute here. And they tell you stories of way back. So, that’s a contribution to, say, the police officer of the area to get to know his area. And also when you talk to the merchants, they let you know, or give you a little insight of what kind of people they deal with, the clients that come in. Or, unfortunately you got the riff-raff, they tell you, look, at a certain time of the day we had so many people standing over here, they’re no good, they do these things. And then we get involved and help them out with the information they give us. But they contribute to the park, like the Riverfest they have here at Lummus Park, they contribute their services, catering services. We’re talking about if you need food, drinks, sodas or something. That means they contribute that too, which is good. They have their business in the neighborhood and they contribute to the neighborhood. So everybody just gets along.  Joe Triana 7  June 4, 1999  AR: So you consider it to be a tight community?  JT: Yes, most definitely.  AR: The merchants know each other?  JT: Oh, yes, sure the merchants know each other. And we’re right in the middle because we deal with the merchants and we deal with the residents. We’re that line in the middle because the residents will come to us, Oh and how is it down the street? Was that problem taken care of? Sure, no problem you can go down there. It’s no big deal, it’s taken care of. And then they go down the block and they enjoy walking at nighttime, they’ll go down there and walk. See, they won’t be scared. And then the merchants will ask us, How is it over there? Did you get that abandoned car out of the way? Sure we took care of that. See? That’s how it works. Really, we’re right in the middle and we deal with both.  AR: So, compared to other neighborhoods in Miami, or neighborhoods that you’ve visited, would you consider this to be relatively a safe area, a safe area relatively speaking?  JT: Sure. Relatively speaking, like you say, I consider it a safe area. Now, I’m not going to say it’s one hundred percent safe, but we do the best we can. We do the best we can because we already know we have the contacts with the local residents and the merchants and we know who doesn’t belong here. We keep an eye on them and we already know who belongs here or not. Now, comparing other neighborhoods compared to this area, it’s a lot larger area that we have to control. It’s not that easy for us because we have other peoples coming in and out. But, basically when you have an area like this particular area here, like Lummus Park, the Riverside, and Downtown, we already have this under control in the sense that we know who comes in and who goes out. It’s not a hundred percent safe, but sure enough it’s going to be safe for the people who come to this area.  AR: What type of crime do you have to deal with mostly here? Joe Triana 8  June 4, 1999  JT: The only crime that we’re dealing with here are the people who complain about people breaking into their cars. Nothing major, no assaults, no robberies, or anything like that.  AR: No drugs?  JT: No drugs. After we started patrolling the area, they disappeared. Because the bad guys see now that they have somebody here. Our job is to be high visibility on horseback, riding around, mounted patrol, high visibility. And that deters the crime right there, that’s what happened and it dropped completely. The park here used to be full of vagrants, homeless people. Unfortunately, they don’t have a home, but they can’t be in a park twenty-four hours a day. So, we helped them, we tried to find them some place to relocate. Thank God it worked out and now the park is cleared of not all of the riff-raff, but the riff-raff that used to come here alone, which used to bring problems, it’s clearing out. So, basically crime here is not that much of an issue here. Now if you go into other neighborhoods you’re going to have crime because we have areas that have drugs. And they have drugs, and they’re bringing people, and you’re going to bring crime.  AR: Which neighborhoods in particular?  JT: We’re talking about Allapattah where I work. There’s several other areas there that are drugs areas, Overtown, which have their particular spots which are drugs. When you have drugs, you have problems. You have people going in. They have to get the drugs, they go out and they do the crime: they break into cars or they rob people to get the money to supply themselves with the drugs. Those areas there are more—I would say, economically it’s lower income people. That’s why probably something like that, that’s why it’s the issue. And, in a sense, in that area they don’t have any labor or, development for work, work development places for work. Unfortunately, it’s like that. But, little by little, it’s progress. The city’s been involved in helping out, and we help them out. We have set up programs for them, which is good. But, little by little. Joe Triana 9  June 4, 1999  AR: I think you kind of answered this already, but I was going to ask you, why mounted police officers? Is it just a visibility issue?  JT: You mean why do they have mounted officers in a particular neighborhood?  AR: As opposed to patrol cars, or motorcycle.  JT: Well, it goes back to the City of Miami as a tradition. The mounted patrol was started by Chief [Unclear] back in the 1930s. It’s a tradition. You see, back then we’re talking about Comstock Park, that’s an historical park there also. It’s on Northwest Seventeenth Avenue and Twenty-eighth Street. It used to be one of the pioneer families that started here in Miami, which I think was the Sewell family, I’m not too correct on that, I’m not too sure. But, what happened is they started the mounted patrol and they would donate a horse for the particular neighborhood. So, you have a horse that the family would donate and they say, Okay we have a horse, let’s get an officer on the horse, and that’s how everything got started. Like down in Brickell, we have another horse down in Brickell, Coconut Grove. See, the merchants would donate horses and that’s how it is. And talking about why compared to a patrol car, it’s the high visibility, and also it’s when you’re going to communicate with people out there. A lot of people prefer, sometimes, going up to an officer with a horse. That’s the first thing they’re going to come up to, Oh what a beautiful horse, or what a nice horse. And they’ll start touching the horse and that’s where you have the communication between the police officer, not being a bad guy, but the police officer and the people. In a car, what you see is the police officer riding around with his windows up and that’s it, goes right by and that’s it. There’s no communication. At least the horse draws attention to the public. They walk up and that’s where you have your communication. You say, Wow, that police officer was not a bad guy, at least I can talk to him. He’s not like I see usually out on TV: the bad guy or something like that, the tough, macho type guy. But, at least I have some communication with that guy. So, that’s one of the reasons why. High visibility deters crime in the area. That���s one of the reasons.  Joe Triana 10  June 4, 1999  AR: I wanted to ask a little bit about Lummus Park in particular. How often is it used? Is it a frequented park? And what sort of people use it?  JT: Unfortunately, they just got the park started now. They fenced it off because, like I said, there was a lot of homeless people that used to come in here, but they fenced off the park. How frequent they use it? I mean you have the residents, like right across the street from the park, they have an elderly folks home [unclear]. The old folks come here during the afternoon, and walk around the park. Or at night time when it’s cool, they come out here. And like where we’re sitting now, you can see for entertainment they have their own little building here and they have like chess boards, checkers, and dominoes. They also have, like in this building here, they have a little dance studio, you see. When they have a little party or something they get together here. But it’s frequented a lot by the people in the neighborhoods. They have the community meetings here, which is good. That’s the community with the police department and try see what kind of problems or what issues they can solve and come and work out together. It’s important. I think in most areas now they do have something set up like this, which it’s called neighborhood policing for us. But, it’s a program which in they pick a particular park or a particular area and they have something like this, these kinds of offices. And it draws the people together and the police department together, which is good. Seeing that and, like we said, how often do they frequent the area? They would frequent it more, would come more to the park, because they know police are going to be there and they’re going to be protected. That’s the main thing. They’ll worry about crime and that but they’ll be protected because, Oh there’s a police over there on horseback or there’s a patrolman there. So, that’s what’s good about it.  AR: And are there any other people other than the elderly? Do younger people use it? Do the merchants come here off hours and use it?  JT: The merchants come here at lunchtime, they do. They come by. The people that are working around here or will come and visit in the area. They do come by. They come into Joe Triana 11  June 4, 1999  the park and they get to know a little bit about it because Lummus Park, right here, is very historical. We have one of the oldest houses on the property here in the park, and also a fort. It’s called Fort Dallas, one of the original trading posts here close to the Miami River, which, you know, it’s a lot of history. It’s one of the oldest buildings here. You know, it’s interesting because they come in, and they walk around in the park, and they see these buildings, and they have the little plaques there and it tells them a little background, a little story about the building. So it’s interesting. But, what I was saying is… I lost it. [Laughter] So many things in my mind now.  AR: We were talking earlier about the park having been cut down significantly. Do you want to talk a little bit about that, a little history?  JT: Yeah, a little bit of history about Lummus Park, let’s see. Originally the park used to go all the way down to the old courthouse. We’re talking from the river all the way down to the old courthouse on Seventy-three West Flagler, which is a pretty large size. It’s, I would say, about a quarter of a mile long almost. But, it’s a wide area. And then the development in the 1960s with I-95 coming through, it cut the park to, literally, more than half of the park was gone. And then they developed, east of I-95, the Downtown area, which was buildings and all of that. Then they just had a little patch. Then somebody said, Hey look Lummus Park is a historical site, they have a fort there and it’s been here for many years. So, they made it a historical site. And what’s interesting about it now, for the past couple of years they have a festival here, which I enjoy. It’s called the Riverside Festival, which I really enjoy. And it’s great because they come in here and they go back in time, in other words. They dress up like back then in the 1800s, and you have a militia, and they have all these artifacts there, which is great. And then people come in and they look at these things, and it’s back in time! It’s incredible! I was lucky enough to do one of these festivals about two years ago, and I met very good people. A lot of them told me history and stories about this area here which I never knew. And that’s how you get to know things, and I was astounded by it.  Joe Triana 12  June 4, 1999  AR: Who organizes it?  JT: The NET office here and also the Historical Museum, or those people who organize the historical sites in the area, that’s who organized it. I can’t really elaborate too much on who organized it because I’m not too familiar. But there were a lot of people here. And there were from different states which came down and had their little exhibitions of old time tools. There was one party there that had old knitting-works, the way they knitted back then, and their clothing, and how they made their clothing. You know, like that, which is interesting. Simple things like spoons. What kind of utensils they used to have back then. Simple things which you never see now or then, because those are way gone by now. And it’s incredible when you see these things. The different kind of dressing from the eras. The Civil War dress and the Spanish-American War dress. They had exhibits there: clothing and soldiers and pictures, and the stories behind all these pictures, which was great.  AR: Do people from the community participate in the festival, too? Or is it mostly outsiders coming in?  JT: No, it’s a combination of both. People from the community and people that come from out. Out front of the park they have like little food courts. Go out, you have a soda, have a drink, sell a hot dog and then you enjoy the day. But it was great. You meet a lot of interesting people which inform you about a lot of good things. It’s great.  AR: How many years have they been doing that now?  JT: I think they’ve been doing it for the past three years, this festival. I didn’t get a chance to work this last festival, which was not too long ago, because I was on a [unclear] job, they sent me to another job. It’s great, they should keep on doing this. If they get a chance they should do it in other areas so, like I said, the people who do live in the neighborhood realize what they have in their neighborhoods and appreciate it more and take care of it. Maybe that would be good for the taking care of for the parks and Joe Triana 13  June 4, 1999  other buildings. Like kids, I would say, kids look at this and they say, Wow there’s history behind that. Instead of writing graffiti on old buildings that are abandoned, which they don’t know what it is. But it means something to other people, which is historical. Which is true, there’s a lot of old buildings around here in the area and in Miami, which goes way back. Like down in Coconut Grove they have an area there where they have these old buildings that survived the hurricane in 1926. And you look at these houses and you say, Wow, this is incredible. It’s a couple of blocks and a lot of people don’t know until you talk to the residents in the neighborhood and you go, Wow, these houses how long? Oh, they’ve been here since the early 1900s, late 1800s. And they were built like this, it’s incredible. You go there and you can see the way they’re constructed, because in between the houses, they’re held by cable bars. You see this only in Key West and, you know, Key West most of the buildings are historical there. And back then it was the Bahamians that went in there, the Bahamians that went to Coconut Grove and were the first settlers there in that particular area. Then you go, Wow, that��s a lot of history, which is great.  AR: One last question, for now anyway, about who comes to the park. Do you have any young people, kids, or teenagers who come to the park? And, if so, how would you say the park affects them or impacts them?  JT: Around here you don’t see too many young kids that often, maybe a couple, but not as much because we have elderly homes, two retirement homes, in the area plus you have the Downtown area. You don’t have schools around here. The schools are apart from here, they’re not close. So, you don’t have too many kids around here in this neighborhood. Mostly it’s grown-ups, adults that live around this area.  AR: Would you say the park is well known beyond the immediate area?  JT: Sure, the park is well known. Besides that, even though not many kids frequent the park, in the park, you have a playground for them. You can see out there, if you go out there, there’s a playground. They had kids in mind. If they do come, they have Joe Triana 14  June 4, 1999  playgrounds out there. But, unfortunately, only adults live in this area here, not that many kids. The park is well known. You have people, like I said, I’m in the festival and people come from across town and say, Yeah Lummus Park has been here and they give you a little background and it’s good.  AR: Well, you brought up a lot of great stuff that we may return to later, but I wanted to ask you some more stuff about your background and maybe also spend some time on New Jersey. You lived in New Jersey for a while. Could you give me an idea of your family life? Did you have any brothers and sisters, for instance?  JT: No, I was the only child. I grew up up north and the climate up there was cold. But it was fun because every city has their nostalgia, I don’t know if that’s the word to use. But it’s great, you grow up in a big city. Going to school up there was different. Except for the grammar school and high school. But, I really learned when I started going to college. I went to New York. I was exposed to big life and the big city. It’s different because now you’re out of your world. And up there it’s incredible because it’s international. You have people from all over the world. I started going to architecture school up there and I met people from all over the world. It was incredible.  AR: How did that experience affect you?  JT: It gave me a different outlook. I say, Hey, don’t just be contained to your little neighborhood. You have to be open because you have so many people. I grew up mainly with a Cuban background. I was born in Cuba. I came to the States when I was three years old, so I’ve been here for a while. But still, you have to open up and talk to other people so you can learn about their cultures, which you do learn. They talk about simple things. About their food, Hey you want to try some of this, Hey sure! They bring their own food and you learn about their food. Their dress, the way they dress. The way they talk, their communication. We’ll sit down on a break and we’ll talk, Yeah back home I used to do this, I used to run at such and such fields, or go up in the mountains and do all Joe Triana 15  June 4, 1999  this. Things like that. And you go, Wow! Like I said, up there it’s a big city. Some of my friends I had, one was from Tanzania. He said, No I go about a mile and I actually see all the wildlife out there. And I go, Really? Yeah! Then I had friends from London, Europe. I had French, I had Germans. It was great. And it was good because it gave me a better outlook. It opened my mind, in a sense, when I dealt with all these people. Different cultures. You learn. It’s not just one [unclear] neighborhood, that’s what you do. Play stickball, that’s a big thing up there, play stickball, head down the block, and go bowling, and that’s it. There’s a lot of other things besides, out of that particular block. Up there it’s blocks. We had so-and-so from the Forty-third Street Boys. We used to do this thing, you know the gang. Not like the gangs now but—  [Tape Breaks]  AR: This is Aldo Regalado at Lummus Park continuing the June 4th interview with Officer Joe Triana. Well, we were just talking about your neighborhood back in New Jersey. Was it Union City?  JT: Union City, New Jersey.  AR: Actually, I wanted to ask you some questions about that because one of the things we’re trying to do is get a sense of how Miami neighborhoods may be unique or different from other Miami neighborhoods, but also from neighborhoods from elsewhere, out of Florida. So, what kind of neighborhood did you grow up in? How would you describe it?  JT: Well, the neighborhood I grew up with, everybody was close-knit. Families were close-knit and everybody knew just everybody from there. Everybody’s parents would go, Hey, so-and-so got in trouble. Wait until I see your father, I’m going to tell him what you did. No, no, please don’t! So, up there everybody was close-knit. Everybody took care and looked out for each other. Comparing it to, let’s say, if you weren’t from that particular neighborhood they already knew that you were a troublemaker, Hey so-and-so is a troublemaker, watch out, we already knew, or were aware. Comparing it to down Joe Triana 16  June 4, 1999  here, I don’t know. I did not have a childhood down here so I really can’t say how it was down here. I came down here when I was like nineteen or twenty years old and I was in college. So I really didn’t experience childhood down here, going to school and that development stage going to school and high school. So I really don’t know how it is, or would be. I guess the way I see it, as working as a police officer, in my experience, seeing the kids out there, the juveniles, would be the same way that in the neighborhood they were close-knit. They would know, from across the street to house by house, they know who lived there. There were that many kids on the block or the street.  AR: In Union City what was the, the block that you lived in, what was the economic level?  JT: The economic level was medium class. There was medium class and upper-medium class. We had a wide variety of people living there, not only Cubans. As a matter of fact, then, we had Italians, we had Germans, Polish. It was a mix of people, which was great. The Italians, one weekend or one day, they’ll invite everybody from the block down to the basement, up there they had basements. This particular family lived in a four-story building and they were all a family. Down in the basement they would make their own seasoning. They would make their own tomato sauce. And the wine, they would make the wines and all that. You would see the truck come in and bring in the crates of grapes. And you go, Wow, I’ve never seen that before. And since you already know them and you’re already in that particular neighborhood with them, you live there for a certain amount of years, they already trust you. So, in fact, you’re down with the family and you’ll be there stepping in the wine barefoot in the big barrel, stepping in there barefoot, crushing the grapes and making wine. Or making the tomato sauce. Normally, a Latin family doesn’t do that, but now you learn something there. And they show you the way they cook and all that. And they have a little Italian party in the backyard with all the goodies, all the food. And then the Cubans on one side will call them over, invite them over and show them the roast pig up there and all that. And that’s the way it was up there. That’s the way that I grew up in that neighborhood where I lived. Joe Triana 17  June 4, 1999  AR: So it was a good relationship?  JT: Yeah, it was a good relationship.  AR: Were there ever any conflicts along ethnic lines?  JT: Not at all. Where I grew up there, I shouldn’t say there weren’t, but in the area I was in, there wasn’t. Everybody was close-knit. I’m not going to say there weren’t any ethnic conflicts because there were. We had the Italians against the Blacks, the Cubans against the Puerto Ricans, and believe it or not Latin against Latin, and back and forth. You had your little pockets of that. It’s all over, that’s not safe. You always have your little ethical something somewhere. But where I grew up, we were tight. That was the best thing, everybody understood each other and respected each other. There were hard working people back there. That’s basically what drew everybody together, because you can see what kind of person you are, if you’re respectable. If you work, they see you’re a working person, your family, if you have a good family. It’s respect, they’re good people. If you have somebody there who’s a drunk and then nobody works [unclear] you say, What the heck is this? That tells a lot about you. They’re going to judge. If you have a Latin family there like that, they’re going to say all Latins are drunks. You know how that stigma goes. So that’s the way it was. They could see the way your family is. Hardworking people, my mom and dad worked two jobs and I used to work for my parents delivering papers. So they could see how you are. They accepted that. If you’re a respectable, hard-working family, they accepted that. We’re good people. That’s how everybody grew up together and related to each other.  AR: And what did your parents do for a living? What did they work at?  JT: My father back then, he worked as a mechanic, but he was more like an electronic mechanic. He worked with small appliances. My mom, she was drawn to factory work, at a handbag factory, and made handbags. That’s where she worked.  Joe Triana 18  June 4, 1999  AR: Would you say that your neighborhood was a safe neighborhood to live in? Were you, let’s say, comfortable walking around at night?  JT: Yeah, back there where I lived it was comfortable. It was quiet. Like I said, everybody knew each other. No particular problems. Walking around at night was no problem. I don’t know about now. There’s a lot of changes all over the place, I don’t know about now. But back then, yeah.  AR: What did you guys do for fun? You mentioned stickball. You mentioned bowling.  JT: Yeah, well, up there in the city you really didn’t have that many parks. Stickball. You set up a baseball diamond out in the middle of the street. Home base, one car would be first, the sewer hole in the middle of the street would be second, and another car would be third, and then you’ve got home plate painted down, spray-painted in the middle of the street. And that’s stickball. And you have the guys and you have a little baseball game. Or else we used to play stickball against the wall. You used to have the square as the strikeout zone. With spaldeens, those are the balls we used to use. We use a rubber ball, spaldeens. The only balls used for stickball. And we used to play handball up against the wall. And football in the street. Summertime, that’s what we used to do. Then when the wintertime came, the cold, basically we were out there playing the same. Football season would come and we would play football in the middle of the street in the snow and all that. Basketball, we would go out to the schoolyard and play basketball out in the schoolyard. That’s the type of childhood. That’s about it. Snowball fights. Whatever, it was an agenda at the time. We used to go down to the river and fish, the Hudson River, we used to go down and fish. That was an adventure. Go down to the Hudson River and we used to fish in the Hudson River and all we used to catch were eels. The catfish, forget about the catfish, they were ugly things. We were scared to handle them because that was so polluted back then. Unfortunately it’s a beautiful river, but it was polluted back then. You pick up these grimy things coming out of there and you didn’t know if it was a fish or a ball of mud. But that was it. Joe Triana 19  June 4, 1999  AR: So it was a good childhood?  JT: Yeah. When we had the chance, Jersey Shore, we used to go down to the beach and all that. It was very nice.  AR: What was the beach like, what was that like over there?  JT: The water was cold. The beaches were very nice, small, little towns. They were very nice. It was beautiful. Like you see in these paintings: you see a little store, and then you see the sand dunes, and then the saw grass, and the little fence. It’s incredible. That’s the way it used to be, the beaches out there, the shoreline. But, now it’s progress. I remember when I used to go a couple of times to Atlantic City, it was an old beach resort place. Old homes, the boardwalk, all of that. But now you have casinos, you have Atlantic City. But, the beach area up there was very nice. It was very quaint in many places, very quaint. It was great, I enjoyed it. I miss it sometimes. The only thing is the water is too cold up there. You couldn’t go in the ocean up there. I mean, if you jump in the ocean, you had to jump out the next second shivering. It was so cold, the water, you would be shivering. I mean, it would be ninety-five degrees. The sand, you can even walk on the sand. And if you jumped in that water, you had to jump out and put a towel around yourself. You had to cover yourself. That’s how cold that water is. But it was great.  AR: Who would you normally go to beaches with? With your family or with friends?  JT: Family. Friends. Yeah, that’s it. We used to go a lot to a place up in coastal upstate New York. It was on the border state of New Jersey and New York, there was a park there used to be called Bear Mountain. You ever heard that? Route Nine going north?  AR: My wife’s been to Bear Mountain, she lived up in New Jersey.  JT: Bear Mountain. It’s a park and also they had a swimming pool. In summertime, usually on the weekends, that was the place to go, everybody would go. Joe Triana 20  June 4, 1999  AR: Daytrips? Or spend time there?  JT: No, just daytrips. Saturday afternoon or Sunday the whole day. Because they had a campground there, you also have a picnics. You have a picnic and then you have the pool. Everybody would swim a little bit in the pool and then go back to the picnic. Then you have the mountains, you go out in the mountains and do a little hiking. You have the waterfalls there, all the creeks and little waterfalls. You go have an adventure. You’re in the city, you have these tall buildings all the time, then you go out into the mountains and it’s completely different. It’s good.  AR: How do you think these experiences have affected you: going to the beach, going to these parks? What effect did that have on you?  JT: I have to tell you the truth, it made you feel adventurous, in a sense. That’s the experience that I felt because you see this wide open area and all you see is trees and trees and mountains. And you go, Wow. And then you start and you say, I’m going to go over there. So you start hiking and see if you can make it over there. And then, along the way, you might see a deer. Maybe you see a new bird that you normally don’t see in the city, all you see is pigeons or rats. That’s the city. But out there in the mountains, you see a new bird, or you see a woodpecker. You see something, Daddy, wow, have you ever seen that? It’s curiosity, you’ve never seen it, so you stand there looking at it. Or you might see a raccoon. You never see a raccoon. Things like that, the wildlife. But I mean it’s nature. It’s completely different, the nature. Then you walk and all the sudden you find yourself a little waterfall. You take time and you take a little bath under the waterfall. The water’s coming from the mountains. You see a creek, you go in there and see if you can find some fish. You go try to catch a little tadpole.  AR: Without those experiences, how does the city make you feel in contrast to that? What emotions do you get from growing up in a city neighborhood like that?  Joe Triana 21  June 4, 1999  JT: In the city you have all these buildings. You feel confined because all the time you’re going to have everything, all the people. Like when I used to go to school in New York City, you stop at a crosswalk to get across the street. Next thing you know, you’ve been there for one minute, when you look back you see a hundred to a hundred and fifty people there waiting to go across the street. And then when the sign changes to walk, all the sudden you see a wall right across. On the subways at rush hour, incredible. I mean, I never used to go in front with a platform when you’re waiting for a train. You’ve got to make sure, when a train is coming, make sure you’re not that close to the platform because it’s like sardines. Everybody is like sardines. You look over and you see all the little heads. My emotion was confined, it was just confined to that area. And everything was so rushed. Everything was stressed, in a sense, you would say, because you had to get there on time. Then when you change from that environment to going to the beach or going out to the mountains, it’s very different, it’s very nice. It’s great. That’s the kind of emotion that you feel. That’s my experience. Every day rushing. Rush, rush, rush, I have to beat everyone. Rush hour. And once you’re out there you relax. I don’t know if I said it right.  AR: I think you did. I think you said it great. How about museums? Were there a lot of museums?  JT: Oh, that is beautiful. That is what they like down here. Not down here. Up there, I mean. That’s the one thing that I enjoyed, was the museums up in New York City. You had all types of art museums, natural history museums, which is one thing I missed. It’s a shame that they don’t have them down here because I learned a lot. When I used to go to school, we used to have field trips because we used to go to school there. Grammar school, high school, we used to go on trips to the Museum of Natural History, or the Guggenheim Museum of Art, the Modern Museum of Art. And it was great, you spend the whole day there and you could go the next day. You could spend a week there and you would still pay. That is what they should have down here, those museums. If they do Joe Triana 22  June 4, 1999  have something like that, the kids will enjoy it. Field trips like that to museums, kids will learn a lot. And I miss that. There’s a lot of culture up there, in that sense.  AR: How about public libraries?  JT: Oh, public libraries? You’re talking about New York Public Library, that’s one of the largest ones in the whole country. That’s incredible. I mean, you step through those doors and you look down and you go, Whoa, what’s this? In the time I lived, it wasn’t that big as New York City, I should say, but it was only about maybe ten minutes away on the bus. I had a public library that was only about two blocks away from the house, which was great. It was a small building, very nice building. Me, into architecture since back then, I always liked going there because it had this façade, it was beautiful, old type. And I used to go there for the projects, school projects, reading projects and all of that.  AR: Did you go there on your own like outside of school?  JT: Yeah, sure. Outside of school I was there on, not a daily basis, but I was there weekly doing a little reading. Sometimes I’d pick up a book and a couple of friends would come pick up books on automobiles, antique automobiles, or airplanes, kid stuff. And we would just sit out there and read the books. And they’ll take them home and read them. If I had a school project, like an essay or something like that, I would go over and pick up some material and that would cover it.  AR: That’s great. I’m trying to see if there’s anything else about your neighborhood that I want to ask, the neighborhood you grew up in. Were there neighborhood organizations that you remember when you grew up?  JT: Organizations like for kids? Like Boy Scouts and stuff like that? Or are you talking about the church I used to go to, St. Augustine Church? They used to have their organizations at the church, I used to go to that. I used to go to Sunday school [unclear] couple of years. Sunday school, they had their organizations and I always got involved. Joe Triana 23  June 4, 1999  AR: What sort of activities did those organizations do?  JT: They had picnics. Charity work. I shouldn’t say dances, but little dances. Basketballs games, sports events, little sports events like that. That’s the work they used to do. Get everybody together and help out. Go to a particular area and clean up. Basically, that’s it. Selling drives, that’s how you call them? When I was a kid we had selling drives. I used to sell cookies. Used to go out and sell them. Donations for the church.  AR: Where do you live now? What neighborhood do you live in now?  JT: I live out in Hialeah. I like Hialeah because I live close to the race track. [Laughter] Not only that. It’s centrally located. That’s why I live up there. I take it for my job in the sense of transportation. From there, where I live at home, to when I used to work down here in Downtown, the Downtown police station was only fifteen minutes away. When I used to work at Flagler and Twenty-second in South District station that was only another fifteen minutes away. Now where I work out of Tropical Park, that’s where the office is at, where the barber(?) is at. It’s another maybe fifteen, twenty minutes away. The commuting time is great. Now I dread commuting on the highways. I don’t like rush hour. I get stuck in traffic. I guess as you get older your patience goes a little bit. But, that’s why I live up there. Hialeah, basically, where I live, the neighborhoods look like neighborhoods. Close-knit, again. The families have known each other for a long, long time. My parents bought the house on Seventy-seventh. I would live there on and off because I used to go out to the beach and I would stay at the beach, or I go room with somebody. But basically I am there at the house now. And it’s great. It’s still a lot of the old people. The old folks are still there. And the kids, some of them have gone and married and all that, or gone away for school. And it was a mix, back then. It was a mix. It was Americans and Cubans. But now as the years, the projects went by now it’s basically more Cubans. The influx, they came in the Eighties. They’re hardworking people, and it’s good. They’re family people. Now it’s nice because I have a daughter Joe Triana 24  June 4, 1999  who’s five years old, and I see their kids too, the way they’re growing up also. And it’s great because they have a chance of experiencing something new. Down there, where they came from, is completely different. I’m saying in Cuba. When I was three years old I didn’t really recall that much, but I think back when I came here to the States. It’s not that easy but it’s a lot better off than the situation that most of the people are in now down there. But going back to the neighborhood, everybody is close-knit. They know each other. And the kids now, like I said, when I was young the parents of kids, You did something wrong. Now I’m in that, Hey come here, what are you doing, you shouldn’t be doing that. See what I mean? It all falls back into place in one way or another.  AR: So would you say it’s a good place to raise kids, the neighborhood you live in?  JT: In the neighborhood I live in, yes it is. I’m not going to say it’s one hundred percent good because we always look now. But, now that I have a daughter, a child, I would say I would also like the best for my child. The best education like everybody strives for when they have kids around. They like the best of everything for their child so they can progress more in life. [Unclear], better for life. But it’s good, hopefully it’ll get better. There’s always time for better education or a better place to live. You need to take it in stride. Take it little by little. You take what you can do for what you’re living for at the moment. You can’t assert yourself because if you assert yourself, you can’t deliver whatever you want at that particular time, and you have nothing to fall back on. You live at the level you’re at. You do the best you can. Like I said, you have kids, show them the best, the good and bad, hopefully everything works out, [unclear]. That’s good. The neighborhood I live in is good, I have no complaints. I said the race track and you laughed. Believe it or not, that’s one of the most beautiful and the oldest racetrack in the United States. And it’s a historical site now. And that’s one gorgeous place, I mean that is beautiful. I like going there.  AR: Could you describe it?  Joe Triana 25  June 4, 1999  JT: Sure, I’ll describe it. Even the entrance into the place is lined up with these Royal Palms. You don’t see them in many places. They’re huge, mammoth Royal Palms all lined up at the entrance. You go there, you see the track. It’s an old coral rock type of building which is beautiful. It was built back in the 1920s. Back then, that was the place to be in the 1920s, the Roaring Twenties, that era. You had everybody coming out: movie stars, gangsters, used to be a lot of gangsters back then. Everybody used to go there. The way they built it is incredible. The fountains that are in there, and the coral rock buildings, and the track itself, the flamingoes they got in there. Flamingo runs they’d call them, I don’t know which race it is but the flamingoes start flying and circling around the track and then they land back into the lake, there’s a lake right in the middle of the track. They land right back there. It’s great, it’s a beautiful place to pass a Sunday afternoon or Saturday afternoon. It’s really nice.  AR: So do you go there often?  JT: Not that often, not like I used to. Believe it or not, it’s right in the middle of the city and once you enter that entrance with those palm trees you feel like you’re completely in a different place. It’s tranquil, it’s incredible. You don’t even know that the area outside is the city because its lined up with all those beautiful palm trees, trees all around. It’s like you’re in another world. That’s the way it is. It’s a very interesting place.  AR: What else do you do for leisure, for fun? You and your family?  JT: For leisure, when I’m not working about eighty or a hundred hours a week, I like to sit down and read a book. I like reading. Listening to music. I like to listen to music, or watch a good movie on TV. Dedicating my lifetime to my daughter. The more time the better, but there’s some leisure time where I take her on a drive. I still like the beach. I go out to the beach every once in a while. Soak in some sun, do a little swimming out in the beach.  Joe Triana 26  June 4, 1999  AR: How is the beach compared to the beaches in New Jersey?  JT: Oh, the beaches down here are completely different. First thing is the water. The water’s great. It’s crystal clear down here, up there you don’t know what the heck you’re stepping in when you step in the water. When you step out of the water up there, your feet are all black tar. [Laughter] No, the beach is completely different. Water-wise, the ocean is completely different down here than up there.  AR: How about people-wise?  JT: People-wise. They’re friendly. But now you have, South Beach or the beaches here, the tourists. You have a lot of different tourists from different countries. They’re friendly. They just want to get to know how the area is. That’s why maybe they want to be friendly, so you can tell them how it is down here. And you talk to them. It’s not bad, it’s nice. It’s always good to have a good conversation. You learn.  AR: How about movies? Do you go to movies often?  JT: Not that often. I used to go to movies. I stopped going to movies because, believe it or not, I don’t like the aspects of the movie theaters.  AR: How so?  JT: You’ve got the kids and these gangs, and you’re just setting yourself up for trouble sometimes. You never know what might happen. Unfortunately, it’s a change of times. That’s the way it is. I don’t go to movies anymore.  AR: This is the neighborhood theaters?  Joe Triana 27  June 4, 1999  JT: Oh yeah, we had neighborhood theaters. Where I live there’s plenty of neighborhood theaters there. But like I said, like gangs and all that, you see the little gangs of kids and the juveniles. Nowadays, the mentality of these kids, I don’t know what it is. Private schooling(?), they’ve got to do something. They pick up, I guess a lot of these things they do now is either going back to the TV, or movies, or music. Unfortunately, that’s the way it happens. I don’t go out as much, in the sense of the movies, like I used to.  AR: How about television? Do you watch television? What do you watch?  JT: What do I watch on TV? Let’s see, I watch Kojak with my wife all the time. Just kidding. [Laughter] No, I like Kojak. To me, a good sport event. Like basketball games, like the Playoffs, the basketball game. Football season comes, you know, football game. Watch my cable if there’s a good movie. And my daughter she likes Cartoon Network, all those little goodie channels. She has a TV and her own cable in her room so she watches all that stuff. My favorite channel is the Discovery Channel, that’s the channel I like. Since I was young, I always liked the wildlife, you know, the shows of nature. I always liked those shows. I used to watch this show up north used to be called, uh, Wildlife of Mutual of Omaha or something like that. You ever seen that?  AR: Mutual of Omaha’s Wild Kingdom? With Marlin Perkins?  JT: Yes, that’s it. Thanks a lot, that’s the one. As a kid, I used to watch that a lot. It used to come on Sundays.  AR: Yeah, my dad and I used to watch that together.  JT: Yeah with the Lawrence Horse Show afterward. [Unclear].  AR: Well, let’s see. You have a daughter. Are you married?  JT: No. Unfortunately, no. I’m getting divorced now.  Joe Triana 28  June 4, 1999  AR: I’m sorry to hear that. I apologize. My questions are now all over the place as I’ve been flipping back and forth, so give me a moment here to regain my bearings. You mentioned youth gangs being at movie theaters. Would you say youth gangs are a problem in your neighborhood, or a problem in some of the neighborhoods you patrol? If you could be specific about where.  JT: There are problems all over the place. You’ve got them all over. They’re scattered all over. My neighborhood, not in the neighborhood that I live in, but the city that I live in, Hialeah, they have certain areas that are out there. Here in Miami, you have the certain areas that are out there. It’s all over. If you go to affluent neighborhoods like Coral Gables, they have their areas there also. They’re all over the place. [Unclear]. It’s been like that for a while. Some of the gangs, don’t get me wrong because I say gangs like when I used to be growing up, when I was young, I said gangs to you, I mentioned gangs. But our gangs were the gangs from the block. Like, Hey we’re going to play so-and-so gang from Forty-ninth street, we’re going to play baseball Saturday, or basketball. That’s our term of gang. And the worst that we did was a little push-shove match, a little black eye and that’s it. Call it off and that’s it, that’s the way it used to be. Not now, now you’ve got guns and knives, it’s worse. That’s the way it is. But they’re all over and I would say that some of them are more violent than others. Some of them want to be gang wannabes.  [Tape Breaks]  AR: This is Aldo Regalado at Lummus Park continuing the June 4th interview with Officer Joe Triana. This is the beginning of Tape Two. Okay, Officer Triana, I’ve asked you about your neighborhood experiences, your leisure experiences, your public space issues in terms of growing up and your own leisure time. Let’s talk a little bit about your politics and your community life. What is your political party affiliation?  JT: I’m a Republican. I really don’t get politics too much. Joe Triana 29  June 4, 1999  AR: Why are you a Republican?  JT: Why am I a Republican? It used to be for the people, now they’re against the people. I don’t know. Politics for me, I don’t like it. It’s dirty. Politics for me is dirty. There are a few far-in-betweens which really come out and help and you have a politician that really would do the job. I would say most of them really are just out there doing la-la-la, rah-rah, this and that, next thing you know, whoever contributes the most, that’s who gains the most and from there on forget about everyone else. That’s fine because you have politicians that will help you. I’m basically not too much into politics. I’m affiliated with Republicans but I don’t even follow the issues.  AR: How do you think politicians in your neighborhood relate to the needs of the community, specifically in your neighborhood? Well also, politics in relation to the City of Miami since you work here.  JT: Okay. That’s not a good question. Where I live, Hialeah, we have a mayor, whose name is Martinez. He’s been there for a very long time. He’s been elected to office for several terms now. The man’s been elected there because he’s doing something good. And it’s true, I agree. Like I said, far-in-betweens. People who will help out the community. He’s one man that does it. City of Miami, don’t get me wrong, we’ve had our good mayors and we���ve had our bad mayors. I’m working here. I’m an employee of the city. This is my career here. And basically, I’ve liked some, I’ve disliked some. I’ve disagreed with some of the issues they’ve had because it affects everybody. Me, as an employee, it affects me too. Right now we have a mayor who’s pretty good. And the politicians here like commissioners and that, they help out. We have ones that weren’t that good, but now it seems like we have some that are good. I stand by that because this is my life, I work for the city. So far it’s working. It’s helping the community, they help the community. And they help the public service. The police department, fire department, Joe Triana 30  June 4, 1999  and every other public service agency who’s out there. They’re out there to help, which is good. We were a couple of years under the rug, there. But now slowly we’re coming out again. It’s good, we’re seeing something. [Unclear] Did I answer your question?  AR: Yeah, you did. I want to return to some of your job experiences. We’ve talked a lot about your experience in this neighborhood. When you didn’t work mounted police, when you worked on the beat, what neighborhoods did you primarily work in?  JT: Basically, I worked the Little Havana area. I spent most of my years there in Little Havana. You know, [unclear] not in Cuba. The language barrier is no problem. Even though you’ve got to be able to speak English, it’s behind the job. But still, you have some officers who don’t speak Spanish. [Unclear] they could be in Little Haiti, which they have, and sometimes I would have problems. And I feel how some of those officers that worked in my area feel. I didn’t know how to speak Creole. Sometimes, a little French and Spanish talk to them, communicate in sign language, but I got through. Primarily, I worked in Little Havana for most of my patrol, street patrol.  AR: How would you describe Little Havana as a neighborhood or as a community?  JT: Well, over the year it changed. We had the influx of the 1980s, the Mariel Boatlift. We have a lot of people that came on that boatlift. Not most of them, but a lot of them were criminals, because Fidel Castro, there, he took the opportunity, he went to the jails and he emptied out the jails. The people who went down there to pick up the families said, Hey look if you don’t take these ten or twenty people on your boat your family is not going. They were bringing on the boat who knows what. There were criminals and mental cases, right out of the mental hospitals. He was clearing out everybody. The dirt was taken out of this country and just sending it over here. So they would end up over here because down there the only place they know is Miami. That’s their first stop. So you can imagine, we have these hardcore criminals that make believe they were harmless, Joe Triana 31  June 4, 1999  political prisoners was the term they used, but in actuality they were a whole bunch of hardcore criminals down there: murderers, rapists, and all sorts of thing. And they would come on and they would infiltrate here. And then slowly as they were getting to know how the system worked here, they would take advantage of the system, and then they would go do their own things, drug dealers and all that. But as the years went by working there, either they killed themselves off or they moved out. That’s the way it worked out. Back then we used to have, what are called emergency calls, with the lights and sirens on; every five minutes we would go to a shooting or stabbing or that sort of thing. And it involved, mostly, that kind of particular person. You could see it. Most of those people, you could see they went to jail because when you look at their bodies, they were like a newspaper on their bodies of tattoos. They have all sorts of things. They have life stories written down on their arms, from being in jail. As years went by, some of them got to know the system. Some of them changed for good, found themselves a job, lived a decent life, changed the way they were. And basically, years extended, I see the change and gradually you have a little bit of everything. You have a mix of everything in Little Havana. You have some upper class neighborhoods, middle class neighborhoods, and you have some low income areas. That’s part of the city. We’re becoming a big city. Miami, a lot of people are moving down here, it’s becoming a big city and that’s the way it is. Big cities have problems. We’ve got all sorts of people in Miami and all sorts of problems.  AR: Do you have a sense of what the biggest problems are in Little Havana right now?  JT: Right now, the biggest problems, I would say, it’s not drugs. Surprisingly, no, because it’s gone down. There’s been a change. They moved down or they said, Hey let me change my ways and work or something like that. But, you have your crime. You have your burglaries and your robberies and all that, but it doesn’t compare. You have a little bit of everything like any other big city. No major problems, like anywhere else.  Joe Triana 32  June 4, 1999  AR: Little Havana has also changed a lot in terms of the nationality of the people that are moving in now. It’s a lot more diverse now. It’s not just Cuban. How would you say that has impacted on the society?  JT: Like in the mid-Eighties you have Central America, you had the conference there. Nicaragua, El Salvador, and all those other countries and they started moving in. And they’re still moving in here. [Unclear] getting people from South America. Pretty soon we’re going to have a big Columbian community here, which we had already, but we’re going to have a bigger Venezuelan because of things going down in the country. They impact us culturally. That’s the good thing about culture, because you learn more about them. You learn how they are, which is good. But sometimes the mix of all those people, they bring over the people who are not, I would say, progress or the well-to-do of the country: teachers, or medical professors, professionals. I would say, [unclear] bring the people who can’t survive there, who couldn’t do anything. Those are the people that come over here. You have your criminal elements that would come here. That’s what happens. They’re just bringing over their cultures. And they’re all different because in Central America, their type of lifestyle is really, educational-wise, not so much education. Farm people and all that. What they do is Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, they’ll be drinking on the corner. They bring that custom over here and then we have to adjust to that and tell them, Hey you can’t drink twenty-four hours a day the whole weekend, it doesn’t work here. Maybe in your country you can do it, but not here. Or beating up the wife. It’s a custom. They get a little bit out of hand, the wife gets a little bit out of hand, you smack her a couple of times. But, hey, you’ve got to adjust to the laws here, you just can’t go around beating your wife. It doesn’t work that way. It’s different here. You come from a different country, but it’s different here. You get in trouble for that. We explain it to them. And each culture brings their thing.  AR: What are some of the specific cultural characteristics in terms of positive contributions and negative contributions that you see different groups coming in? Joe Triana 33  June 4, 1999  JT: I touch on, like I say always, the good thing about different cultures coming in here is learning the way of the lifestyle. The simple things like their music, their food. Because when you have a festival here, like a Columbian festival, Nicaraguan festival, Jamaican festival, they bring in their music, they bring in their food, the dress, the way they dress. That’s brining in the culture, that’s the good thing. That’s the insight. The bad part about that is like I just explained to you. Their laws are different than our laws here, talking about laws. Maybe you don’t see it, but we do because we deal with it. It’s the way they carry themselves and their family. The way they discipline their kids or they discipline their wife or whatever, the way they act in that sense.  AR: Which nationalities would you say have a harder time assimilating or integrating?  JT: Right now, we’ve got Mexicans over here. A lot of the people that come over here don’t have papers. Mexicans, Central Americans, we’re talking about Nicaraguans, El Salvadorians, Panamanians, Columbians, Venezuelans. What is difficult—excuse me, let me adjust myself. What was the question?  AR: Which groups do you think have a harder time assimilating?  JT: Which group? In particular which group?  AR: Yeah.  JT: You know, I really can’t say which group. I’d say all of them, because it’s all new to them. In particular not one group is better than the other one anyways. It’s all of them. They’re all human and they come here. I see, in a sense, they’re brought up one way then they have to adjust and learn another system. It’s difficult on all of them.  Joe Triana 34  June 4, 1999  AR: Do you see people coming to Miami and then staying splintered or do think that people come to Miami and tend to gel into a Hispanic or a Latin-American [group]?  JT: Well, there’s the people who have more education. Those are the people who blend in and fit into the system, find a new job, do this and that, because they have a higher educational background than the other people. You get a farm worker that comes here, what the heck do you do? He only knows how to do farming. He’s not going to survive here. How is he going to blend in with the other people? That’s when you have your conflict with the other people. You can’t work with the system. Unfortunately, he’s isolated in some way and that’s when you have your problems with that individual person. That’s the one you see normally standing on the corner drinking. Or maybe the drugs [unclear], you know, that’s where they get involved with drugs. That’s the way—my experience with it.  AR: I guess I was wondering if, um, let’s say you have those elements that don’t fit in. You have Nicaraguan elements that don’t fit in, or Venezuelan. Those elements that don’t fit in, do you see them staying as distinct groups or do they gel—?  JT: Let me get back to that question, I guess I never answered it correctly. Let’s see, do they gel? That’s what I said about education. That they gel into them because they’re more equipped, or better prepared to confront whatever is put against them here. Maybe that’s the gel. Those are the ones that gel. The ones that don’t split there cannot. They’re the ones that their country, might come from the countryside, lower class, they just come here because they figure a better chance economically-wise, they come here. But, they really don’t know what they’re getting themselves into because the first thing they have to know is the language. A lot of them maybe don’t even know how to read and write. They figure here to get a job you have to first speak the language, you have a lot of things, and it doesn’t work out for them. And all they do is they come here and they send them out to pick fruits out there for three dollars an hour or something like that. If they Joe Triana 35  June 4, 1999  don’t spend a living, they’ll move somewhere else. In fact, they won’t stay here in Miami, they might move up to New York. If they don’t go to New York, they might go to California, or they might go to Texas, or the Midwest. So, it’s like a cycle. In reality, it’s not only here, it goes all over with these individuals. Going back to Mariel, Mariel’s [unclear] moved down. I met some of those guys at Mariel, they did more traveling than I did around here in the United States. Have you ever been to here? I was over here a month ago. He went across the nation to the other side of the nation in less than two months and lived there and went back and forth all over the place. That’s the way it is. I guess it’s the way, in their country, the way the culture is, which is completely different. It’s a culture shock. So that’s why gelling, like you say, the ones that are better educated or more aware of what they’re heading for are better equipped to confront whatever is ahead.  AR: Do you think Little Havana is as tight-knit as Hialeah or, say, even Union City when you were growing up, or do you think it’s a more fragmented community?  JT: Fragmented. Because I’ll tell you something, back then when the Cubans came, when they were settling up north. [Unclear] Union City because, we started talking about the conflicts. They didn’t know what kind of class of people we were. It was very difficult for the people that came there for the first time. Because of the language [unclear]. I remember my father when we used to go rent an apartment. They have For Rent there. He would go there and he would go talk to the landlady and she would be from a European background or whatever. She would say, No, it’s already rented, take the For Rent sign off the window, next thing you know two days go by, you pass by and the For Rent sign is still there. That happened to a lot of Latin people, Cuban people, that went up there back in those days. So, now I guess it’s the same thing, almost. Because you don’t know how these people portray themselves. Their culture is completely different. You hear, I shouldn’t say you hear, but you see a lot of this. That’s why a lot of these people get isolated and they don’t give it a chance. [Unclear]. Like I said, compared to up in Union Joe Triana 36  June 4, 1999  City, the time back then when I was growing up, to now it’s completely, I shouldn’t say different. It’s almost the same.  AR: So you feel that people coming in now are having to face these problems and discriminations?  JT: I had to go through the same thing. I had to face the same thing.  AR: Do you remember any other incidents growing up that are strong in your mind of feeling discrimination personally or seeing your parents discriminated against?  JT: Back then, like I said, when we were up there, the language barrier. We didn’t speak English. You go to a place and you don’t speak English and they would look at you [scoff] and continue.  AR: And you experienced that a lot?  JT: I was young, but I could see it. Not only with my parents, but I would see it with older people, I used to go to school with(?). I’d see older Cubans [unclear]. And now it’s basically the same thing. These people they’re coming over, and unfortunately, it’s like that. Like I said, you’ve got to get yourself used to a new system, you’re prepared, you’re welcome. That’s the way it is.  AR: You said your family and other Cubans were stigmatized coming to the country, did you sense that that stigma changed as time went on, as you spent longer in the country?  JT: It changed because they’d see what kind of people we were. That’s what I said when I told you about the neighborhood I grew up in, the kind of people. We were accepted because they saw what kind of people we were. That’s the way it is. Gradually, they see Joe Triana 37  June 4, 1999  how you are. Like I said, I gave you an example of being a drunk twenty four hours a day and a family who works twenty four hours a day and they see it’s a good respectable family, who they choose or who they didn’t choose, necessarily. I don’t think it’s like that.  AR: Would it be fair to say that you have these two issues, class and race, do you think it’s fair to say, then, that you believe that class outweighs race in terms of the way people perceive others? That if you’re a particular race but you’ve fit into to a certain class, you comport yourself in a certain way that you can overcome the race problem easier?  JT: It’s a combination of race and class. It’s a little combination. It has to with the way you portray yourself. [Unclear] Say you have an Anglo over there, blue eyes, and a black man over here. You see, that guy there is no good just because he’s black. [unclear] without seeing what kind of person he is, hardworking and all that. It’s a little combination of both. That’s the way the cultures, too. Other cultures are developed more than other cultures, other countries are developed more than other countries. You have a Third World country compared to the United States. Sure enough, if you grew up here, you went to a school system here, you have kids or whatever, you’re not going to move to a Third World country because you don’t know what a third world country is going to be like. The kids are not going to get the same education as you get here. You’re not going to have the same living as you have here.  AR: I guess we could go to conclusions then. Do you feel there are enough public spaces: parks, beaches, museums, etc. in your neighborhood and your community? And I guess we can talk about two separate communities. I’d say one, Hialeah the community you live in and two, the community you work in.  JT: Believe it or not, both of them are great. I could talk for both cities. They have many pools and parks. The county, they have allotted areas for parks because they know, Joe Triana 38  June 4, 1999  people, you have families and kids that need parks for recreation. Pools for recreation, too because down here, you’re talking about climate-wise, the climate. Summertime, you’re surrounded by water. You need pools down here. Now, compared to where I grew up north, we didn’t have sufficient pools. The only pool I talked to you about is the pool up in Bear Mountain. And then we used to have a pool, I remember the other city was Hoboken. The YMCA in Hoboken, it was a beautiful pool, mineral water, it was beautiful. Parks up there, up there weren’t that many parks.

The date is July 14th, 1999 and we’re beginning the interview at 1:27. The topics of discussion will be public space issues, the Little Havana neighborhood, other Miami neighborhoods, and any other issues that come up as a consequence of that discussion. So, thank you very much Commissioner for doing this. We’ll start off with the basics. When and where were you born?  Bruno Barreiro: I was born in Clearwater, Florida in 1965. My parents came over from Cuba in the early Sixties and they settled in Clearwater, Florida. That’s the place where they had their first jobs. After that, after I was born, we moved to Miami-Dade County.  AR: What did your parents do for a living in Clearwater and also what did they do before in Cuba?  BB: My father was a nurse in Cuba and when he came over he worked as an orderly in nursing homes. My mom as a housekeeper in Clearwater, and my mother was a teacher back in Cuba. Since then my dad has gotten his registered nurse license.  AR: How would you describe your relationship with your parents and your childhood growing up?  BB: We’re very close. My parents, and I, and the family had a very close family. Not a big family, but close.  AR: Do you have any siblings?  BB: I have a brother, a half-brother, from my father’s. My brother is six years older than me and we get along very well.  AR: Were you guys close growing up? Did you do stuff together growing up?  3  Bruno Barreiro  July 14, 1999  BB: We were close. We grew up together. Every summer he would spend with us and the family. He’s my half-brother from my father’s side. But, every summer he would come over and live with us at our house and we grew up together.  AR: When did you leave Clearwater, what year? And where did you move when you left?  BB: We left right after I was born, from Clearwater, and then moved here to Miami-Dade County.  AR: Where in Miami?  BB: In Little Havana.  AR: Little Havana. So you grew up there?  BB: My first couple of years we spent it on Fifth Street and Eleventh Avenue. We had an apartment there.  AR: So, how would you describe growing up in Little Havana? What was the neighborhood like? You childhood impressions?  BB: It was an immigrant community. A lot of Cubans were moving in at that time. My parents were working, both of them full time. My dad started a medical clinic and I remember going with him to work every morning and spending the day with him, all day.  AR: I’ve talked to a couple of people who, I guess, moved to the neighborhood at around the time that you did and they mentioned that it was kind of a community in transition, that there were sometimes tensions: ethnic tensions, or language barriers that existed. Do you remember any such experiences as a child?  BB: Not many. My parents tended to work with a lot of people from Cuba. And my dad, not knowing English fluently, worked with Hispanics. I had a very good childhood. I have good 4  Bruno Barreiro  July 14, 1999  memories of it. I remember when the clinic would close I would help my mom clean the clinic. We would come in the afternoons when it was closing and we would help clean everything, the floors. In the sense of tensions between other [unclear], I never saw that. My dad got along very well with the landlords and they were very helpful. They helped my dad a lot in the beginning of his professional career here.  AR: And what was the school experience like coming here?  BB: In school, I went to Fairlawn Elementary and prior to that I was put in some day cares. And Fairlawn Elementary was very nice. There was a lot of transition, a lot of young Cuban children coming in and going into school. I remember, I didn’t know English until I went to kindergarten. And when I went to kindergarten my teacher was speaking to me in English, I go, bueno, what is this? That’s why I started learning English. And it was very interesting, but it was challenging. And we adapted with television, with music, with everything around you. And the youth were able to adapt fairly rapidly.  AR: That’s actually a question I was going to ask you, because coming here from an early age also from Puerto Rico, my father’s Cuban, I remember not speaking English, too. And I remember learning it, I don’t want to say the hard way, but I remember not being able to speak it. So I was going to ask you about that. Were you teased a lot at school for not knowing English?  BB: There were a lot of us in those years going in that didn’t know English. I think we were a big group. I wasn’t a separate case in the school that everybody knew English and I was the only one, there were a lot of us going into kindergarten at Fairlawn that didn’t know. So, we all coped and learned it.  AR: How would you describe the sense of community in those early years in Little Havana?  BB: I think a lot of people cooperated with each other. A lot of families cooperated. Sometimes they had to help each other or you’re supervising their kids when they had to do special, they’d have babysitters. There was a lot of cooperation back then in the early days.  5  Bruno Barreiro  July 14, 1999  AR: Do you remember anybody in particular who cooperated with your family or anybody who your family helped out?  BB: Yeah, there were. There were friends of my family. There were a lot of friends that they knew each other back from Cuba. They sort of kept the same relationships here and they helped each other out. Whether it was trying to find jobs or trying to do their daily chores.  AR: Let me ask you a question about the neighborhood in terms of safety. When you were growing up did you feel it was a safe neighborhood, did your family feel it was a safe neighborhood?  BB: Yeah, it was definitely a safe neighborhood. We felt that way.  AR: So you felt you could walk around at night, let’s say, and not worry?  BB: Yeah. My mom didn’t have a car and my dad, well my dad had a car, but my mom didn’t. I remember walking around and it was fine. It was safe.  AR: You mentioned that you spent a lot of time at work with your parents, and obviously at school, but what did you guys do for leisure growing up, as a family?  BB: I remember going to the theater, to the local movie theaters. And we would also go down to the pier, Bayside, back then. There was a big marina there. Sometimes we would go to the beach. Family outings. So we would enjoy some of the facilities that were there.  AR: Going abroad, let’s say to the pier, what is now the Bayside area—actually we should take them one by one. What were the experiences of going to the pier, what sort of activities would you do there, what people would be there?  BB: We would go just to watch the amount of people going out in the boats. Obviously we didn’t have the means to have any of those things. But we would just go to enjoy and see some of those 6  Bruno Barreiro  July 14, 1999  facilities. We would go to the beach a lot on weekends. I remember going to South Beach and I remember going to Crandon Park.  AR: And these were primarily family outings?  BB: Family outings.  AR: Would it just be the nuclear family or would you go with extended family or friends from the neighborhood, from the community, that sort of thing?  BB: Usually the nuclear family. But, sometimes we would go along with friends. You know, whoever was available or was interested. We didn’t have a big family so it was probably limited to four or five people.  AR: Did you watch a lot of television as a kid?  BB: We watched TV, we had a TV. My family permitted us to watch TV.  AR: This may sound like a trivial question, but in some ways it’s not. What types of shows would you watch as a family, and also individually, what were your favorite shows?  BB: Individually, sometimes I would watch cartoons as a kid, as a small kid. Later on when I grew up, regular sitcoms. Then later on, sometimes I watch novelas with my family. My father’s aunt would come to Miami, they lived in St. Petersburg, she would come every year for a couple months and I remember watching novelas with her.  AR: I did that, too, with my mom. It was a bonding moment in a lot of ways. Did you ever go to any parks as kids?  BB: We went to parks to play sports. I used to go a lot to Robert King High Park. Later on, after we lived for a couple of years at Fifth Street and Eleventh Avenue, we moved to a house on Sixty-eighth Avenue and First Street. And Robert King High Park was off of Flagler and Sixty-7  Bruno Barreiro  July 14, 1999  seventh and I went there a lot. After school, I would enjoy playing sports. They had different programs: basketball, tennis. Then they built a racquetball court, a one-wall racquetball court, and I remember playing racquetball. So I enjoyed that park.  AR: So could you describe, again, the sorts of people that were there in terms of age groups, ethnicity, class?  BB: Middle class. Immigrant families. A lot of Hispanics, a lot of Cubans. I remember the park director, Shorty, he worked in the City of Miami Parks and Recreation for many, many years, thirty years at least. And he was very good, very helpful with us. A lot of kids from working families.  AR: How late did you go there in your early years in terms how old were you when you frequented the park?  BB: I went to the park even through my high school years. There was a park that was close by. I played a lot of sports in my school like basketball and track and if I wasn’t doing that after school, a specific sport and we didn’t have practice, I would sometimes go to the park myself or with friends and play and enjoy their facilities.  AR: You mentioned that they had, early on, programs. These were mainly sports programs?  BB: Yeah.  AR: Were they year-round?  BB: Year-round. Different teams. Whatever the sport that was in season, whether it was tennis or basketball or flag football.  AR: Did they consistently maintain these activities throughout your childhood and into your high school years? There was no change in terms of availability?  8  Bruno Barreiro  July 14, 1999  BB: We saw it diminishing. Back towards the end of my high school years I saw a lot of the programs diminish. But I was also getting involved more in high school activities that kept me away also. But I saw that.  AR: Do you have a sense of why they were diminishing? Did you have a sense at the time of why and do you now looking back on it have a sense of why?  BB: I imagine it should’ve been probably funding that wasn’t available. That’s what I imagine, but I’m not sure.  AR: In terms of parks when you were growing there as a kid, again I asked you this about neighborhoods, but did you see them as safe places, places where you can go pretty much any time of day?  BB: Yeah, they were definitely safe. The parks were safe. There were attendants all the time, whether it was a park director or an assistant, there was somebody there.  AR: How about policing? Do you remember policing as a child?  BB: There was not much policing. I don’t think it was needed because you had the park personnel.  AR: And the sense of security, did that last throughout your high school years or did you also notice that to be changing?  BB: No, it stayed more or less within the same realm. It was secure throughout my high school years. I didn’t see a major shift.  AR: You mentioned that the parks were frequented mostly by a lot immigrant kids, I presume mostly Cuban immigrants. Was the park ever used by any other ethnic groups? Are they the Anglos or African-Americans?  9  Bruno Barreiro  July 14, 1999  BB: There were. There were some different nationalities. There wasn’t that many African-Americans per se, but there were some Americans. But it wasn’t a large amount.  AR: Did the groups tend to do activities together, play together?  BB: Yeah, we all played on the same teams. It wasn’t like they had different sports and we had different sports.  AR: That’s interesting because I’ve been interviewing a couple of people about some other parks, and I haven’t dealt with Robert King High Park at all actually, but some of the other parks. And they’ve described, specifically in Gibson Park in Overtown, some very clear divisions in terms of what activities are played by which groups but we can talk about that a little bit later. We’ve dealt with parks, we’ve dealt with beaches. How about zoos, museums, or any other public spaces that you can think of?  BB: My parents took me a lot on weekends to different—you know, I went to Seaquarium. I went to the zoo back when it was in Crandon Park, the old zoo. My parents took me to different locations. Obviously they weren’t frequented but I did have the opportunity to attend, to go to some of these places.  AR: How about public libraries? Did you go to those with frequency?  BB: Yes. There was a fair amount of libraries. I think it’s still there, the branch, it’s on Eighth Street and Sixty-eighth. I went there and I remember every once in a while I had to do a major report and had to get something that wasn’t there and I had to go to the main library down on Biscayne Boulevard. But that was very rare. I attended, did my homework.  AR: Was it mostly for school or did you go there also for leisure?  BB: No, mostly for school.  10  Bruno Barreiro  July 14, 1999  AR: Do you remember if they had any activities offered through the library that you may have partaken in?  BB: I think they had reading groups. I didn’t participate that much in those programs but I remember that.  AR: Well, wrapping up, then, this sort of segment on your early experiences, what would you say that these spaces: parks, beaches, zoos, museums, but specifically parks and, I guess, secondarily beaches. How did they affect your outlook on things, your life? What would a world without these places have been like, do you think?  BB: It definitely gave me an opportunity to meet friends, and to meet my neighbors, and experience different aspects of life. Whether it was the zoo or the beach. But, I think it was healthy also, the parks. I’ve always been into sports and I think it’s a very important part of life to be able to unwind from the work. They’re very helpful. Now when I meet kids, I tell them to get involved whether its sports or hard activities, I encourage them.  AR: Do you have kids of your own?  BB: No, I don’t.  AR: So do you use parks now?  BB: Yeah, I go walking a lot with my wife. I live on the beach, so I walk a lot on the beach. And I enjoy that.  AR: How would you say that now, beaches and parks, do you feel that they are the same place as they were when you were growing up? Have you noticed any change?  BB: I think, unfortunately, some of the parks weren’t given the proper attention from the government. We saw a lot of gangs taking over parks and a lot of crimes being committed at parks. But, recently, I’ve seen a minor change towards cleaning them up, and starting to bring 11  Bruno Barreiro  July 14, 1999  families back in, bring sports, organized sports with directors, park directors. I’m seeing more of that. But I think it still needs a long way to go.  AR: Could you be specific as to where you see, in terms of the project anyway we’re dealing mostly with the parks in Little Havana and in Overtown. Can you sort of target the areas that you think have gotten worse and which ones you’ve seen improvement in?  BB: I think the park on Eighth Avenue and Fourth Street was really bad at one point. Jose Marti Park was bad. The area around the Orange Bowl, the park at the Orange Bowl, was bad. But I’ve seen them being turned around. I see Jose Marti is being cleaned up. You’re seeing more kids enjoying the facilities. I think the one on Eighth Avenue and Fourth Street the one where, unfortunately, the baby kid was shot by a gang drive-by a couple of years ago, but after that, seen more activities there. Groups coming in and forming baseball teams and using the facilities. I also think we’ve got to start gearing the parks toward the culture of the people surrounding the parks. For the Cubans, baseball fields were excellent. But you’re seeing a lot of, in the Little Havana area, a lot of South Americans, some different South American countries. And their primary sport is soccer. So I think we need to make sure that soccer fields are in place so they could use those facilities. Because if not they won’t be able to do their recreational sports, their sports that they like to do. And I’ve been asked by a lot of communities to see if we could do that, if we could somehow change the planning of some of these parks.  AR: Do you think there’s the political will for that amongst, I mean, you have that vision, but are there other people that share that vision and are aware of that need in terms of tailoring these parks to specific communities?  BB: I don’t know. I have it, I’m looking at it, but it has to be brought to the attention of the City of Miami Parks people. I’ve been trying to do that.  AR: What initiatives have been taken? I mean, you already mentioned that there’s been some improvement already at places like Jose Marti Park. What initiatives do you see that have led up to that improvement and what initiatives have been taken that might push things in a different direction in the future? 12  Bruno Barreiro  July 14, 1999  BB: We’ve been targeting the gangs in the neighborhoods to get them off the streets. And that relieves the ability of them to go into parks. We’ve been working with the NET office so the police has a presence and they pass by the parks and they frequent the parks. Some initiatives have been, like Jose Marti was gated up so at night it’s closed so people don’t come in and vandalize the facility. We’ve been working with some organizations like the Orange Bowl to encourage some of the minor league baseball, peewee leagues, to keep them operating. Working with different groups.  AR: I want to come back to some of these later but first I would like to jump for a moment, correct me if I’m wrong, I read on your webpage that your district includes both Little Havana and Overtown?  BB: Yeah, part of Overtown.  AR: Part of Overtown, okay. I wanted to ask you a little bit about both of those communities now as neighborhoods. Obviously you grew up in Little Havana so you probably have a stronger understanding of this community as a neighborhood. But, I’d also like your insights into Overtown. How would you describe both of these different communities as neighborhoods in terms of community life, their greatest strengths, and also the greatest obstacles that they face, the greatest needs?  BB: When I talk, in Overtown specifically, the section that I have doesn’t have a lot of youth. It’s a lot of public housing projects and geared towards elderly. So there hasn’t been that huge demand. But, they have requested passive parks, those types of facilities. I’ve been trying to talk to—well the City of Miami has already gone through and they’re in the process of opening up Lummus Park and bringing that back. I think that’s going to be a very nice passive park that everyone can enjoy. We are talking to different groups and organizations, encourage along the river, the Miami River, like a boardwalk or a river walk, and that would encourage more people to use those facilities and enjoy the river. We’ve been working on that project.  13  Bruno Barreiro  July 14, 1999  AR: Somebody brought it up to me when I mentioned this project that cities like Fort Lauderdale or San Antonio have great riverside spaces and I was specifically going to ask you about that, about why Miami doesn’t have, we have a river, so why don’t we have those spaces? Could you give me a sense of why historically you think that this has not happened?  BB: Well, the facilities on the Miami River, first of all it’s a working river. But also the properties along the Miami River have been privately owned so they haven’t been opened to the public. They’re private businesses or private homes. What we’ve been encouraging is to try to get some of those facilities to either turn them over to the public, or if they’re private, encouraging a program to see if we could create the river walks along the river behind private property so people could pass through and enjoy the river in its entirety. That’s a project that’s going on with the Miami River Commission that I sit on, and we’ve been trying to make that happen.  AR: What are the prospects do you think?  BB: Very good. There’s a lot of plans on the table and now we’re trying to get the funding, which is always an obstacle. But, I think we’re going to be able to accomplish it. We’ve been working also with Trust Republic lands to do these types of projects.  AR: This may be an impossible question to answer, given the way things go, but is there a timetable for any of these projects?  BB: We expect the City of Miami should have a piece of the river walk down by Lummus Park within a year or so. That’s what we’re working on, that project. And at the county, if we pass the transportation plan, there is a portion in there for greenways which also encompasses river walks and there will be funding there for those projects so it’s a good possibility there.  AR: Great. I was interviewing somebody from Overtown and they made the point, and I found it interesting, that parks are needed in Overtown, parks are important, but there are so many issues that are important as well: housing, maintenance of neighborhoods, policing, and she was talking about how all of these issues, including parks  14  Bruno Barreiro  July 14, 1999  [Tape Breaks]  AR: July 14th interview with Commissioner Bruno Barreiro at his Little Havana office, the year is 1999, and this half of the tape we’re starting at about two o’ clock. So I was asking you about that greater need.  BB: There is a lot of need. In housing for, say, the county, there’s been a lot of dollars to create housing, but then the maintenance of those facilities, there wasn’t funding for that. And we’ve been working on revising some of those plans to include maintenance. It’s a combination of things. That’s just one area in particular, housing. But also job creation is vital, job training. We’ve been working on different family social issues.  AR: Do you get the sense, because the few people that I’ve interviewed in the neighborhood, have expressed frustration, a great deal of frustration, because so many different plans have been created over the years and they see very little progress made. Could you speak to that in any way? Why has that been the case and what is being done differently now, do you think, that could address those needs? When you mentioned how parks should be tailored to the different communities, one of the things they mentioned, and I was very interested to hear you mention something similar, is that Gibson Park has these baseball diamonds. They don’t play baseball though, they like football. And they don’t have any facilities to play football. So, not only is it that that there isn’t any movement, but sometimes they feel that what is provided historically hasn’t been tailored to their needs.  BB: That’s a big problem. We’re trying to work with that. You have to take into consideration the demographics of the neighborhoods when they go to build a park or refurbish a park. You know, you can’t put ice skating rinks in South Florida. We’ve got to work with what we have. I’ve been working with that. We saw the Parks Bond that was recently passed a couple years ago. We’ve seen a lot of improvements in parks due to that. People do consider it a major part of the quality of life in their neighborhoods. Do they have parks? Do they have adequate parks? Do the parks meet their needs in particular? In Overtown they like to play football, they like to play basketball and they’ve got to take those concerns into their planning.  15  Bruno Barreiro  July 14, 1999  AR: And do you see that being done more now, and if not what are the obstacles to achieving that?  BB: You see more of that occurring. You’re seeing that neighborhoods, neighborhood associations are getting involved with the parks department and making sure that happens. You’re seeing a lot more activism from the neighbors. Never to the extent that you want, but you’re seeing a little bit of that.  AR: How about, jump over to Little Havana, in terms of, what’s Little Havana like as a neighborhood? Again, what are its biggest obstacles? What are its strengths? And how does the community hold together? Especially in light of the immigration over the last ten to fifteen years which has brought so many different new groups into the area. So how does that community hold together in those regards?  BB: I think the issue that Little Havana is a lot of rental, it’s like ninety-five percent rental, is a problem. We’ve been trying to encourage more homeownership in the area, homeownership developments, that would make people try to improve their neighborhoods. They would buy into the entire quality of life issue in our neighborhoods. You tend to see a lot of immigrants first coming into Little Havana, that’s the area of Miami-Dade County where a lot of them come into first, and then once they are able to get a steady job, they move out and they buy a house somewhere else. We’re trying to reverse that and see if we could encourage them to stay within.  AR: What sort of incentives are you trying to offer?  BB: We’ve been working with CBDG funding and non-profit groups to encourage homeownership developments: townhomes, condominiums that they can buy and afford.  AR: Is it working? Have you seen a change?  BB: It’s in its early stage but you see a lot of developers planning these types of facilities and starting to get the funding for them. I think within the next couple of years you’re going to see a lot of that, little projects coming to fruition, being built. 16  Bruno Barreiro  July 14, 1999  AR: Again, both neighborhoods. In terms of safety, how much of a concern is that and what steps are being taken, both in Little Havana and in Overtown, to address the issue of safety, of crime, of policing?  BB: The issue of safety, I think the key there is to work with neighborhood police officers, the NETs, to make sure that they are attentive to different hot areas within the two neighborhoods. They’ve been doing their part, but they’re short in funding and staff. But we have to encourage that, that the proper funding is allocated to these neighborhoods. These neighborhoods have been, for years, the backbone of the City of Miami and we can’t let them continue to go to turn our backs on them. We pour all our money into, whether it’s Downtown or Coconut Grove, we’ve got to pour our money into these neighborhoods. It’s unfortunate, but we have to continue the battle of the issue of the gangs, youth gangs. You have drug dealers coming in taking advantage of these kids, some of them come from broken families, and they’re in a difficult situation.  AR: So how does one go about targeting or eliminating this problem? Is it just having police units that can concentrate on that issue?  BB: Yeah, police units and proper staffing of the parks. You have people there constantly at the park, full time, that’ll turn around.  AR: Do you think there’s a—and this will be the last question I ask, or the second to last—I’ve felt the tension between Overtown and Little Havana communities. I guess mostly I’ve sensed resentment from Overtown residents, I can’t say I’ve felt the same resentment from Little Havana residents. But a lot of Overtown residents have heard, say, that Little Havana gets priority on certain programs or it seems to them. Whatever the case, there appears to be a rift between the two neighborhoods. Why do you think that is? What do you think causes that?  BB: I don’t think there should be any rift between both neighborhoods. Both neighborhoods have been getting some help from different governmental agencies, so I don’t see them in competition, I don’t. The issue here is to bring the economic development, bring homeownership into these areas. 17  Bruno Barreiro  July 14, 1999  AR: Would you say the initiatives in one community have been more successful than in another? Do you think the initiatives for creating homeownership in Little Havana and the same type of initiatives in Overtown, do you think one has been more successful than the other?  BB: No, I can’t judge that right now. But I don’t think it’s more successful. I’ve seen projects in Overtown being planned and gain financing through the county or city. I just don’t.  AR: Could you mention one?  BB: There’s one, it’s called New Hope on Sixth Street, Northwest, and Sixth Avenue or Seventh Avenue. That’s already been basically leveled. The property is cleaned out and they’re working on that. You’re seeing other projects coming on board. You see also a redevelopment agency that they created in Overtown, which has had its problems but I think they’re getting new funding and new administration and that’s going to be helping that area. I’ve been working to try to get them for Little Havana but it hasn’t occurred yet, the redevelopment agency. So, we’re working on it. Hopefully the residents don’t see each other being pitted against one another. The issue here is to make them both work and work on both areas. If anything, both of them should be looking to fight the funding against other neighborhoods which have traditionally received the funding and try to lower it back into their neighborhoods. If they ally, if you could work together.  AR: The people I have spoken to basically have said that they do see a need for that. There are probably barriers set up due to historical realities that may or may not be changing now, but they do see the need for that and there’s just the matter of breaking down those pre-existing barriers. So I think the will is there. I know you have to go so I won’t keep you any longer, but thank you so much for participating in this.  BB: Thank you for considering me as part of the project.

The date is July 13, 1999 and we are beginning the interview at 10:08. The topics of discussion will include Ms. Caporelli’s experiences in the neighborhood and her perceptions of public space and other topics that may come up as a consequence.  [Tape Breaks]  Thank you very much for doing this. First I’ll start off asking you some questions about yourself: where you were born, where you were raised, etc. to get a context for the questions we’re going to be asking later. So, first things first, could I ask your date of birth and where you were born?  Jane Caporelli: I was born in Providence, Rhode Island in August of 1955.  AR: Were you raised there?  JC: Yes, I was.  AR: How long were you there?  JC: I moved to Florida in 1982.  AR: Why did you move?  JC: I had a job offer. I got tired of the cold weather and I really wasn’t going to be here this long, it was going to be an adventure and it just turned into more than an adventure, I guess.  AR: Did you move down with family?  JC: No, I moved by myself.  AR: Actually that’s interesting, too, since most of your growing-up years were in Providence, Rhode Island we’ll want to be getting a sense of what parks and public spaces were like up there in contrast to here. Anyway, how would you describe your family life?  3  Jane Caporelli  July 13, 1999  JC: I am the oldest of eight children. Most of my family still lives in Rhode Island. I have four sisters and three brothers. I grew up in a family of school teachers. My dad is a contractor, my mother was a school teacher. All of my aunts were school teachers or nurses. We’re very, very close, my sisters and my brothers and I. Two of my sisters are school teachers, one is a principal of an elementary school. And two of my other sisters: one is a marine scientist and the other is an aquaculturist. My brothers are all contractors or carpenters. We grew up in a very large-- I’m the oldest of twenty-three cousins. We grew up in a very close family. You know, being Italian on one side and Irish on the other, it was a lot of family. My parents are still in Providence. We spent our summers in Narragansett with my grandmother. It was, I guess, upper-middle class. I went to public elementary school, Catholic all girls high school, and a State university. So it was, I guess a regular-- My mother and father made sure we took art classes, and all that good stuff. We sailed on the bay and did a lot of good things.  AR: How would you describe the neighborhood you grew up in?  JC: We lived in an old neighborhood. It was a mix, predominantly, I would say, Italian. We grew up on a street that was a dead end and there were a lot of kids so we were always outside. Kind of in a suburb that hadn’t really been developed yet. We had great woods in the backyard. You knew that if your mother wasn’t going to be home, that the neighbor was, so there was always somebody there that was looking out for you. And we just were in and out of each other’s houses and there were always somebody to play with when we were kids.  AR: What did you do for leisure?  JC: Like I said, we were outside a lot. We had a tennis court, so we would play tennis. In the summer, we would go to the playground or there was that one day a week that my mother-- we would have to walk to library to pick up books for the week, which for some of my other sisters it was a big chore, for me it was quite a delight. We did what kids do I guess.  AR: You mentioned going to the playground. Was this a big park area or was this sort of a neighborhood-- ?  4  Jane Caporelli  July 13, 1999  JC: Actually it was a school grounds that the town had a playground where the kids could go. And we’d go on field trips and go to the movies and do crafts and that kind of thing. There was a park down the street from my parents house that had been a private estate that we used to go to quite a bit because we could cut through the woods to get there. It was on the way to the library.  AR: It had been a private estate and was made public?  JC: Yes, it’s owned by the state, or the city. I guess it’s a city park.  AR: Did they have organized activities for children?  JC: No. Like I said, it was a private estate and there were still some of the buildings from the private home. It was owned by the Metcalfe family, which were a big textile family in New England, and they had given it to the city along with some of the other parts of their home [unclear].  AR: So were there any other parks in the area?  JC: Not in the immediate area. We spent a lot of time at Roger Williams Park, which is a city park and has the zoo in it. We also went to other parks like Goddard Park when we were together with friends. Growing up in an area where there were no boundaries as far as our yards went – we had huge woods in the backyard-- that was like having your own private park, I guess.  AR: Your recollections would be mostly of those situations then. How often would you say you went to actual state parks like Goddard or Roger Williams?  JC: My mother used to have what she would call mental health days. Those were the days that we would go to Roger Williams Park because there were historic homes in the park, or we would go to other historic homes. Or we would go to the smallest national park which is in Providence and it actually has a park ranger. I think it’s four acres large. But those were her mental health days. We would go to things like the park, or we would go to the zoo, or we would go to the 5  Jane Caporelli  July 13, 1999  museum, or we would do things like that. I think it was more for her mental health than ours. But it probably gave us a better appreciation for things like that than most kids had.  AR: Was this frequent, like once a week?  JC: No, I would say that we did it maybe three times once the weather got warm before school would get out. One of the things that we used to do if one of us got poison ivy it was a mental health day for everyone, we had to go to the beach because saltwater would help that. But those are what she called her mental health days.  AR: One thing that’s of interest to me is you said that it was a very mixed neighborhood and the Italians are probably predominant. Could you elaborate more on the different groups that made up your neighborhood, the ethnic mix?  JC: We grew up with African Americans, there were a lot of Cape Verdeans and they were just our friends, so you really didn’t think about them being different.  AR: So there were never any ethnic clashes?  JC: Never. I mean, I heard stories about when my parents were kids, that in Providence the Irish and the Italians would have their clashes similar to what we go through here in Dade County but that was years and years before.  AR: Did you see traces of that sort of conflict in older people growing up in your neighborhood?  JC: No, not really.  AR: You mentioned beaches. What were the beaches like up there?  JC: Beaches in New England are a little bit rockier than they are here. Certainly you don’t go in the water until August because it’s so cold and they’re a little bit rougher. But, the beaches to me were a place I could go to get away from everybody else. They’re very different than here. I don’t 6  Jane Caporelli  July 13, 1999  know that I could move that far away from the beach now, because the ocean is very important to me. It has been as we were growing up: my dad sailed, my parents met at the beach, my father was a lifeguard, my mother taught swimming. So it’s always been kind of one of those constants in our lives, I guess. But they’re very different. There are town, state, and city beaches in Rhode Island.  AR: What are the differences in terms of the experience of going to the beach?  JC: Not really much, except you have to pay some [unclear]. We could walk to the beach from my grandmother���s house and now my sister has a home that is within walking distance to the beach. And as soon as her tenants move out, my mother [unclear].  AR: When you mentioned going to the beach to get away from everyone else did you go there by yourself usually?  JC: Sometimes. Now I go and I take my niece and nephews and we walk on the beach or my mother and I would walk on the beach in the mornings. It used to be a ritual, on August 14th or 15th and, grandma forgive me, that was the one day, as my grandmother would get [unclear], I had to go swimming because it was the Holy Day of Assumption. I don’t remember why, I know I was a kid. She and all her little old lady friends would go to the beach and no matter what they had to go in the water. I guess because it was my connection to my grandmother and that’s kind of why it’s a place I can go and think.  AR: Aside from those private moments, did you also use the beach with friends?  JC: Oh God, yes. When we were teenagers. We were out the door! You get up, you have breakfast, you put on your bathing suit and you’re gone. You come home for lunch or maybe have lunch on the beach and then you came home and had dinner, washed the dishes, and went back to the beach. There was a large group of us and most of us are still friends now. And I’m going back 25 years, 30 years, but it was different there, it was a whole different place. You could do pretty much anything you wanted because your parents felt you were safe.  7  Jane Caporelli  July 13, 1999  AR: Safer than your neighborhood back then?  JC: Well, just safe. The beach was a different place.  AR: What were beach activities?  JC: We tanned. [Laughter] I mean, we were teenagers and we hung out and we listened to music. I mean yeah, we played volleyball and made sand castles, but I think we just kind of hung out.  AR: Was it the place that mostly you went to? I mean you mentioned your grandmother and the little old ladies.  JC: No, there was a mix. We would all sit—I mean it was really pretty funny, you’d be fifteen years old in a bikini that you thought was just fine and your grandmother would put a towel on you so you wouldn’t get cold. It was eighty-five degrees. But it wasn’t a big deal to sit with your grandmother or sit with her friends. We always had lunch, so that was a big part of it, but they always brought food. You watched whosever kids were there and were watched by whoever was there so it was a different kind of place.  AR: You mentioned museums as well, that’s another type of public space that we’re interested in. How would you describe the museums there? What sort of education do you think you got from going to museums?  JC: There were a lot of house museums in Providence. A lot of house museums owned by John Nicholas Brown and other things. When I was a kid I took art lessons at the Rhode Island School of Design. And we would go into the Rhode Island School of Design Museum quite often. They have a very different collection. They have a collection of mummies which my sisters and I couldn’t wait to take our nephew to see the look on his face when he first saw them. They also have a collection of art which is changing, and they have a permanent collection. They also have a collection of historical things from Rhode Island. They have installations from people’s homes that were important in Rhode Island history. They have a collection of china. They have a collection of costumes that maybe belonged to Mrs. Metcalfe or people like that. The John 8  Jane Caporelli  July 13, 1999  Nicholas Brown House is a house museum and they have wonderful things from the history of Rhode Island. So I think I got an appreciation for old things, if you will, just because I could go in belonging to the Providence Preservation Society you could go in and out quite often. My dad as a contractor did restorations of some of the homes on Benefit Street. He also did a farm when we were a little bit older that is owned by [Unclear] Trust. I guess we got an appreciation that those were special places.  AR: And important places, too. Would you say that you were singular in this appreciation or would you say the rest of your siblings going to these places also want to go do the same thing?  JC: No, we all do. My sisters and I travel together quite often, and although we may all be attracted to different parts of the museum, we all know that it’s no question that we’re going to go. We will go to New York and go to the Metropolitan and one sister will go to the Egyptian stuff, and another sister who lived in Africa for several years will go to the African exhibit. I prefer the medieval and the religious works. So we all know that it’s not a question that we’re not going to go, it’s just where we’re going to go in the museum. I think we all have that. My brothers maybe not so much, although they will go, but they probably don’t make a point of doing that. But I think my sisters and I all do.  AR: Why the girls and not the boys?  JC: I don’t know. It’s really kind of funny, they always worked with my dad. My father had his own company and they were probably practiced carpenters by the time they were twelve. And I guess it��s just because they will go and they will look at the architecture of a place and they will look at the way it’s built and they will look at the woodwork. So it’s just a different interpretation of what we’re looking at. I can remember going to a museum with one of my brothers not all that long ago and he was looking at the frames on the paintings. He was looking at the different kinds of woods they used and the way that they had been carved. He’ll walk through a building and he’ll look at the woodwork because he appreciates that. I probably don’t as much but I think it’s something he got from my dad. My sisters and I probably got the looking at the picture itself from my mother.  9  Jane Caporelli  July 13, 1999  AR: That brings to mind the thought about how people are socialized and how often times this can break up among gender lines. Do you think the activities that went on in beaches and parks, and during leisure activities, what were the differences between gender, boys and girls? Basically would your brothers do different stuff than you guys did than their sisters?  JC: It’s probably not the gender difference so much as the age difference. I am twelve years older than my youngest sister, although she did spend a lot of time with us when she was a kid because I was sixteen and she was four. She was probably a very old four because she did spend a lot of time with my friends then. It’s almost because we were so much older, the five older ones who were very close and then there were the three younger ones because there’s a four year difference. I think it’s more that than gender difference. My brother Michael would do things with us. You know, we’d all play softball and we’d all play Monster from the Black Lagoon. I think it was more the age difference between the three younger ones. I know as my mother always said she got tired. We would take my younger brother and sisters to places like that. And I think that was the difference, it wasn’t so much a gender difference as an age difference. We all did the same things, my brothers can wash a [unclear] better than I can. My brother Michael is the best baker you ever—and he’s a contractor. He’s taught his little boys to bake pies. So, I think my parents raised us pretty evenly when it came to those kinds of things, but it’s more of an age difference when we look at things differently.  AR: One other thing I wanted to ask about this appreciation for art, architecture, museums. How unique would you say that was to your family as opposed to the rest of the kids you hung out with? Would you say that most kids had that experience?  JC: I would say that my cousins and I did. It was pretty funny, my aunt Jane, whose my mother’s oldest sister, has seven children. So at any given time there would be twelve or thirteen children in the car and people would count. If you pull up next to someone they’d count and put up signs of however many there were of us. So we would all spend a lot of time together and we would all go to those things. I don’t know about kids in the neighborhood so much. I can think of friends of mine who grew up together and whose parents lived next door to my parents and we would do a lot of that together. I think my cousins were brought up that way, because my grandmother had an appreciation for things that were beautiful. I don’t know, I don’t remember them coming with us 10  Jane Caporelli  July 13, 1999  to do that stuff, but I know my cousins did because it was important. There were four oldest girls, my sister and two of my cousins and I and we would spend time in New York with my aunt. She worked for Cornell at the Nursing School. She taught at the Nursing School. And we would go to museums and we would go to the theater and we would go to the opera. So I think the four of us have that special bond where we would do that and we would occasionally still meet in New York and go to the theater and do that kind of thing. So I know that was important to my cousins, but as far as the kids in the neighborhood, I don’t know.  AR: You just brought to mind something else about New York and I’ll ask about that later, but one thing I wanted to ask about growing up in Providence. How do you perceive the neighborhood changed over time? Did it change over time, how do you perceive that it did?  JC: My parents’ neighborhood has changed in that it has become developed. It used to be you couldn’t see trees through the houses because there weren’t any. We had pretty much freedom through all of this area. There’s been a lot of housing, a lot of people have moved into the neighborhood. Like I said, you could never see anything. You could go to the field to the neighbor’s house because they had a swimming pool. You have to cross a street now to do that. So that’s the difference. When I grew up, my dad gave us a donkey for Christmas when I was six. And Flipino(?), which was the donkey’s name, had pretty much free reign through that whole area. He actually died in 1982, so he was pretty old when we got him. But, that��s something that wouldn’t be possible today. My father has goats, I think he fancies himself to be a gentleman farmer. Actually they were goats that were rescued from a zoo when it was being closed and they have the goats to people. He wouldn’t be able to tie them up places like he did with the donkey. He has to kind of keep the dogs in the house, they can’t have free reign in the yards. So that’s really what’s changed.  AR: How about the sense of community?  JC: There’s always been a strong sense of community in that area because it’s an older neighborhood. The elementary school is within walking distance. We went to a different high school that most of the kids in the neighborhood because my parents wanted us to go to a parochial school. I think that when something comes up, there is a neighborhood. They just had a 11  Jane Caporelli  July 13, 1999  whole thing with a zoning issue and it wasn’t a difficult thing to get everybody involved to do that, there was always a very strong PTA. It’s the kind of town where I will always be Caporelli’s daughter, which is very different from Miami. I will always be somebody’s granddaughter or somebody’s daughter. I guess there is a very strong sense of community.  AR: So it’s maintained that throughout the years?  JC: As far as I’ve seen. I mean I’ve all been away a long time, but we all went to a zoning hearing a couple summers ago when I was home. My sisters and I and my dad, it was about a road closure, and it surprised me the people that I saw there that I used to see at every other one when I was growing up. It was different.  AR: Interesting. One last thing about the neighborhood, popped in my mind because of the mention of the donkey and the goats and whatnot. Was there a lot of wildlife in the area?  JC: Skunks. I mean, not really. Just the normal stuff, you have a raccoon and rabbits. We lived reasonably close to an Interstate, not right there but… You have to understand Rhode Island isn’t as big as Dade County. Yes, if you go out to different places – which you can get anywhere in Rhode Island in an hour, you could get to the end of Rhode Island in an hour – there were deer and there were those kind of things, but not really where we lived.  AR: Very briefly, you said you went to New York periodically. What were those experiences like for you?  JC: They were wonderful. We would go to the theater, and go shopping, and go to the opera, and my aunt would take us to the ballet and Radio City and we’d always have to go to Central Park for lunch one day, which my sisters and I still do religiously. It was like being in a magic place. Because my aunt lived there, it was a whole different-- New York is just a great city.  AR: One of my favorites, actually. I guess we should move on to Miami then. Your coming here in 1982, what was that like? What was the experience, what is the first impression the city makes on you? 12  Jane Caporelli  July 13, 1999  JC: Well, actually, when I moved to Florida I had a job and I lived in Davie for a year because I didn’t know where I was going to be, I didn’t know if I was going to be in Broward. I was coming down to train and then I was going to be in a store. My background was retail, I ran department stores in [unclear]. So I lived in Davie for a while, about a year and a half. I trained in a store, here I am twenty-whatever-I-was, kids in New England heard very little other than Italian, and I went to work in a store in the Mall of the Americas which was Midway Mall at the time, and I had salesgirls who didn’t speak English, and I didn’t speak Spanish. And it was very funny because someone who became a friend, the woman who I was training with, tall and blonde, the exact opposite of me, her parents were missionaries and she spent a lot of time in South and Central America, so she was fluent. So here’s this blonde, blue-eyed, all-American girl who customers would come up to talk to us, and they would speak Spanish and they would expect me to answer and she would be the one who would answer and I would just stand and smile like an idiot. But it was like culture shock for me. I mean, I was up in Broward, which in the Eighties was very, as my father would say, “white bread”. Very white, Jewish, you didn’t hear lot of other languages. I would go to Westchester every day and it was like going into another country. It was culture shock. It was a very difficult first year when I first moved here. I made some very good friends, fortunately, but it was a huge adjustment. And the traffic. The story I tell to kind of give an idea is the second day I was in the store, one of the girls that worked for us went out to get coffee, and I had had espresso as a kid, I mean my grandmother always made espresso, but I’m trying to make a good impression, this is my second day at the store and she brings a Cuban coffee in a cup with these little pill-cups, and I had no idea what those were for, I just thought she had just forgotten the sugar, I thought she’d just forgotten the cream and I drank it and I’m thinking this is really kind of strong. I think I was up for days. That was the culture difference, I thought she had just forgotten something, and not wanting to say anything I just drank it. Of course, that is one of my favorite things now. It just was always kind of strong, it’s kind of heavy. That was the difference. It was a big difference for me.  AR: You lived in Davie for about a year. Where do you live now and how long have you lived there?  13  Jane Caporelli  July 13, 1999  JC: I went from Davie to Kendall, because I was working in the Gables at that point. Then I moved to Miami Beach and I lived in Miami Beach for nine years. I now live in a neighborhood called Edgewater , I live on the bay off Biscayne and Thirty-third Street and I’ve been there for almost five years.  AR: How would you describe these neighborhoods, comparing them to Providence?  JC: The Beach and where I live now are neighborhoods. Davie wasn’t a neighborhood, I lived in a golf resort. I lived in condos [unclear]. When I first moved to Kendall, it was still strawberry fields. And it was inexpensive and it was a nice apartment and I thought it was reasonably close. But it wasn’t a neighborhood, it was just a lot condominiums and little shopping centers.  AR: So when you say no neighborhood, what do you mean by that?  JC: There was no sense of community. If I didn’t know my neighbors it wasn’t a big deal. My friends were elsewhere. I guess the difference is, and I saw a big difference from when I moved to Kendall and to the Beaches, you go into the drugstore, there’s a pharmacy on Washington Avenue and the other pharmacy [unclear] or you’d go, and that was the difference. You’d go into Publix, the Publix used to be on Biscayne, and you’d see the guy that carries your groceries out every day and he knows what car to go to. People say hello to you. You didn’t walk in Kendall, there was no place to walk. There was just no sense of neighborhood.  AR: Did you find that distressing?  JC: Yeah, because there was no roots there, I didn’t feel that I lived there. Yeah, I went home and I guess I just was there.  AR: What did you do for leisure in those early years?  JC: I left. I left Kendall. I would go to the Gables or I would go to friends or I would go over to the beach. I worked a lot. I ran stores, clothing stores. So I worked a lot. There really wasn’t 14  Jane Caporelli  July 13, 1999  much to do at home. [Unclear]. It was starting to be very built up and it was just not a person I wanted to be.  AR: Could you dwell a little more on Miami Beach and then Edgewater? We’ve already talked a little bit on how those are neighborhoods, but how are they different from Providence?  JC: I think the Beach is a little bit more like Providence because it can be a pedestrian city. I don’t know, I’ve lived in the Beach through the transitional period when it wasn’t a really safe place to be. Now it’s such a cool place to be but you don’t want to be there half the time. As most people who move away, they make their own little nuclear family wherever they are. I made some very good friends on the Beach. I don’t know how I can compare them to Providence. I guess, because I spent most of my adult life here. Yes, I was involved in things in Providence. I did volunteer work, and I belonged to preservation societies, and I took classes with them and I did all of that. I guess the pedestrian feeling is about the same in Providence as it is on the Beach.  AR: You mentioned the safety issue. What were the realities of living those nine years in Miami Beach? Did you feel unsafe?  JC: No, I didn’t feel unsafe. When I first moved to the Beach I lived on Fifth Street, which was one of the few blocks that had been restored. There were still a lot of transients, a lot of street people. So it wasn’t that we felt unsafe, it’s just there were areas that you wouldn’t walk, which you would now. Yeah, occasionally you’d go out and have to ask someone to get out of the doorway before you open up your office, because I was working for a non-profit at the time. I don’t know that I ever felt unsafe. We had all the usual stuff, where the car was broken into and those kind of things.  AR: Did you use parks while you lived in Miami Beach? Which ones and could you describe them?  JC: Different ones. We’d go to Lummis Park. We’d go to the beach, we’d walk, because we did walk. Actually when I lived on the beach I didn’t have a car for a while, so I did walk everywhere and use public transportation. Certainly the beach was a big part of what we did. We’d go over to 15  Jane Caporelli  July 13, 1999  Flamingo Park and play tennis. After, as my friends say, my dog found me, I spent more time in those kinds of places because it was recreation for her. South Point Park, because I did stuff with the city for a while, was an important part of – we’d do events there. But I did spend time on the beach and in Lummis Park.  AR: Could you give me a sense of what -- let’s start with Lummis Park – your experiences there and how they’ve changed over time? I understand Lummis Park has gone through a pretty big transformation over the last--  JC: We’re not talking about this Lummis Park, we’re talking about Lummis Park on the beach. Which is the green area between Ocean and the beach.  AR: Okay. Well, could you give me a sense of what that park was like? And again you could contrast that to the parks in Providence, in terms of the people that were there.  JC: When I first moved to the beach, there were homeless people in Lummis Park. That’s basically what it was. It was still, I mean, the hotels on the beach were still the ones with the big porches, and all the chairs, and the senior citizens. There were very few restorations done. It was a still a place where people said, “You live in Miami Beach?” You know, it was a different place. So really, you kind of walked through the park to get to the beach. And that was really it, because it wasn’t a nice place to be. Now it’s a lovely area. So I think that was the difference. Flamingo Park was always a nice park, we always went there. Either to play tennis or to do other stuff, or just watch the tennis or something.  AR: If you have any memorable experiences at any of these parks that you’ve mentioned, could you--?  JC: I could remember, yes I saw Cab Calloway during Art Deco weekend. Luciano Pavarotti on the beach was amazing. Memorable, that’s a hard—did you have a wonderful Sunday afternoon that was just the perfect weather and the perfect company? Yeah.  16  Jane Caporelli  July 13, 1999  AR: I know it’s a very broad question. I’m just trying to get a sense of life at these parks. And if any really bad or really good experiences stood out in your mind and how you would characterize these as either negative or positive experiences: why were they positive, why were they negative?  JC: I don’t know that I’ve ever had a bad day at the beach. I can’t say that there is any specific day that stands out in my mind of Lummis Park or of Flamingo Park. I would say that they’re very positive.  AR: Do you think that they help build a sense of community here?  JC: I think so. When I first moved to the beach, I don’t think the City of Miami Beach took care of their parks as well as they do now, because the population was not young it was elderly. They probably didn’t get the usage out of the parks like they do now. They’re nicely maintained now, they’re taken care of. It’s nice to see people rollerblading or sitting or doing whatever in the parks. I think that they do. I know that whenever they’ve had an issue with dogs and parks or something, it’s been an easy thing to get people together. But, yeah I think that they do, I think they help that. We live in a neighborhood. Living on the beach, there wasn’t great space. You live in apartment buildings, and maybe there was a little six foot square piece of grass out in your front yard. We live in South Florida, it��s always warm, it’s always sunny. Why would you want to be inside? So you have to go to parks to do that, to get out of your condo canyons and your high-rises. We don’t always have that luxury of having a yard like I did growing up. So that’s a whole different thing, there’s more of that here than in other areas.  AR: So do you think there are adequate spaces?  JC: No, no I don’t.  AR: Do you sense that the ones we do have are threatened?  JC: You go to Lummis Park, you go to the one in Miami and it was locked for seven or eight years and that’s a shame. Maybe it’s not going to be a park where little kids are playing softball but there are a lot of seniors in the neighborhood who sit in their apartments all day long, when 17  Jane Caporelli  July 13, 1999  they could sit outside for a little while and not feel threatened, feel that they could be outside and they could be talking to their neighbors, which they may not do being in the park with the doors closed.  AR: Aside from the fact that some of them are closed, unused, or have been, how else would you say they’re inadequate?  JC: I don’t think a lot of them have the kind of activities for children that they should have. They only do stuff in the summer when kids are around all year round. I think that if a lot of parks like Jose Marti or Lummis had things for after-school, then maybe our kids wouldn’t have part of the problems that they do have. I can look at places like Lummis or Jose Marti and understand why the fences were put up, but also understand why they shouldn’t be there. And I think that the children in this neighborhood have not a quarter of the park space they should have. The majority of their parents came from countries where they didn’t live in cities, they lived in rural areas. These kids have no place to play. The new housing they’re putting up is blacktops. They have little, tiny two foot square spaces outside of their sliding-glass doors. So, they need a park that’s functional and well-kept. Maybe they don’t need to go just to hang out, maybe they need to be challenged and they need to have structured activities for them, which I don’t know that a lot of parks in Miami have that. I haven’t seen it.  AR: I was talking to Ana Carrasco who works over at Centro Mater, and she was talking a little bit about Jose Marti Park and she seems to think that it’s improved over the last couple of years. Would you agree?  JC: The park itself has improved. [Unclear] uses it a lot. Her kids use it a lot. They use it every day. There is the children’s playground there that the Kiwanis put up, that is used a lot. The pool is there. The pool that used to be open all year is closed for part of the year now due to the city budgeting problems. Unfortunately, that is the first thing that is affected by the budgets is the parks. The park has gotten better, it absolutely has. And it will get better. They have plans to put a community center in it with programs for children, but that’s been ever since I could remember. I’ve been in this neighborhood for seven years and it’s always been, “well, the plan wasn���t right” or “the community didn’t like where it was going to be” or blah, blah, blah. And the kids that 18  Jane Caporelli  July 13, 1999  could have benefited back then, seven years ago or eight years ago or however many years ago it was, are now the kids who I throw on in our pool on a regular basis, because they’ve gotten older. And where they may have been helped by programs like the Y’s program they have in the park now, it’s only been there for three years, maybe that could have made a difference in their lives. If you don’t give these kids something to do, a constructive activity, then they’re going to find something destructive.  AR: What were the problems with the park before it started to improve?  JC: There were always a lot of homeless. Unfortunately, this neighborhood was kind of the first port of entry. There was always somebody sleeping on a bench, or using the water faucet to bathe, or do something. That’s cleared up a lot. The NET, along with the Parks Department, has been very effective in that.  AR: What about crime?  JC: There was crime. Yeah, there was always prostitution and drugs and all that stuff. And unfortunately I think that this neighborhood, until the river gets cleaned up, will always have a problem with that. If nothing else, they will always have that perception. The Miami River always has a terrible perception in people’s minds. But, most of it was crime of convenience, I think. I don’t remember that we’ve had real serious crime here. But you’re in an urban area and there’s still a lot of homeless here.  AR: So, working here, you’ve never felt threatened?  JC: No.  AR: Was there ever a problem with youth gangs in Jose Marti Park?  JC: Not so much in Jose Marti, but as in Riverside a little bit further up on Sixth Street. I know that there are gang problems. They’re not violent gangs in this neighborhood, as far as I know, 19  Jane Caporelli  July 13, 1999  and I think that if they were that I would know it. But, no, not really in Jose Marti. More in some of the other parks, yes.  AR: Riverside?  JC: Where the baseball field is and over in Henderson. They’ve always had problems in Henderson, but not so much here. But I think it’s probably because the pool is here and because there are park workers here on a regular basis. So, I think that makes a difference.  AR: Has policing changed at all over the past seven years?  JC: Yes.  AR: At Jose Marti, how about in the whole neighborhood?  JC: We have been very fortunate. I think our former police chief, [Unclear], has amazing vision. He has really done an amazing job of policing in Miami. And we have been, fortunately, the recipients of some terrific community cops. We worked very hard to get the Neighborhood Enhancement Team in the neighborhood not on a commercial street; they are right around the corner. So we have code enforcement at our fingertips, we have the police there. They made the mistake of giving me all their beeper numbers. I think that we haven’t had a lot of police turnover in this neighborhood. We’ve had the same cops in the neighborhood for thirteen, fifteen years. They know the neighborhood and everyone knows them. They go the extra mile. I have seen a big difference in this neighborhood. It’s cleaner, it’s different; I don’t know that I can pinpoint it.  AR: How about in terms of ethnic relationships, how would you say the neighborhood functions in that way? Is it a cohesive community or do you perceive a lot of ethnic strife?  JC: It’s difficult to get the people who live in this neighborhood involved in anything. The majority of them are low income working class. They are not necessarily Cuban as it was several years ago. They are from other Latin American countries, predominantly Caribbean and Central. There’s a large language issue, well there is for me. I don’t speak Spanish and it makes it very 20  Jane Caporelli  July 13, 1999  difficult. But I don’t know if coming from countries where they were afraid of authority, or where the authority was less than benevolent is an issue. Or if they are all working so hard that they just don’t have the time to deal with it. I sit on a neighborhood community board, Axiom, which is Community Action Agency’s local board, I also sit on their county board. And just to get people involved in issues, just to get them to come to the meetings is next to impossible. So that’s hard.  AR: You mentioned immigration is one of the things that does enervate people to some degree. Do you have a sense of what other issues are important to the community?  JC: The largest outcry I’ve ever seen here in this neighborhood, or here in Little Havana, whether it was East, West, or Central Little Havana, was when they were going to close the police station. Because obviously crime is an issue, because then there were a lot of elderly. Unfortunately I missed a lot of meetings, most of it was in Spanish. But that was really the only time that I’ve ever seen a large group of people who have been involved in a community issue or problem. There was also a time when they were going to put homeless housing in this neighborhood, and unfortunately we have the largest number of licensed or unlicensed homes of that sort in this neighborhood, more concentrated in this neighborhood than a lot of other neighborhoods in Miami. There was some public outcry on that. But we really had to deal with it, we had to make an issue of it for people to become involved.  AR: Obviously, the face of Little Havana is changing yet again, it has been changing over the past ten years, fifteen years with now more Central Americans or South Americans coming in and it’s not just Cuban now. Do those communities function well together? Do they tend to cooperate, in your perception, or is there infighting?  JC: That’s a hard question for me to answer because I haven’t seen it personally. I’ve heard that this ethnic group wants to set up their own YMCA, or this ethnic group wants to deal with this. That’s a hard question. I know that we have little problems like when the Overtown pools aren’t working and the kids from Overtown come to the pool, the latins don’t want the black kids in their pool or vice-versa. There’s those kind of problems, but I think that’s a kids problem. I can’t say that it’s a big ethnic problem. That’s hard for me to answer.  21  Jane Caporelli  July 13, 1999  AR: It’s interesting that you bring that up because that was going to be my next question. I’ve been interviewing a couple of people, Sabrina Baker-Bouie who works over in Tacolcy, if you know her, or Norma Jean Walker. Both have lived or worked in Overtown and they spoke of a resentment between Little Havana and Overtown. A lot of times it’s manifested because of political issues. One community there’s a perception that Little Havana gets more attention than Overtown and Overtown gets slighted. Do you have any insights in terms of that rivalry?  JC: When the Empowerment Zone came up, and when they were dealing with community issues as far as the Empowerment Zone comes, they were still packaged together, we had meetings here in East Little Havana and they were at the Community Action Agency’s offices on Flagler Street. They were pretty well publicized, but there were only, I want to say, seven people at that meeting. And the majority of them were county workers, who were involved in the process, or what have you. I also went to the one at Caleb Center, because we are now in the Empowerment Zone, this hotel is right in the middle of it and, I think that for what it can do in this county, will be amazing. I am interested in the process. And because we didn’t have that kind of turnout in this neighborhood, I wanted to see how another neighborhood dealt with it. There were a hundred and fifty, two hundred people there who were saying we’re tired of not getting the services that we deserve. I’ve seen it in other things where the black community, or representatives of the black community, who were involved in community issues have said that the Latin population, and they’ve said predominantly Cuban, are very cliquish. They deal with their issues and they really don’t take on anyone else’s. I saw it when there was the whole issue with the Haitian immigration problems and because CAA is very involved in that kind of thing. You didn’t see any united forces, which would have been amazing, which would have been a force to be reckoned with. But you didn’t see that. So, maybe it’s not so blatant, but I’ve seen that. I’ve sat in a meeting with some of the women who I sit on this other board with who don’t speak English, probably understand enough to get by but don’t speak it. And the African-American community, and these were people from Goulds, and Liberty City, and South Miami, and Perrine, those areas, saying how cliquish the Hispanics were. Well, these women couldn’t even defend themselves because nobody would translate for them. And they were like fish out of water. So it was kind of a weird, of course I’m that gringa who sits over there, but I haven’t seen it in a blatant way, but yes I’ve been in conversations.  22  Jane Caporelli  July 13, 1999  AR: That is interesting. And when you were talking a little earlier, just to make sure I have you on straight, you said that there was a large response at the Caleb Center meeting from the African-American community and none here. And yet, from the people I’ve talked to, it seems that despite that outcry not much is done. At least the community feels that not much is done anyway.  JC: Basically what they were saying was that we haven’t gotten anything and we’re tired of it. We’re tired of it being passed over to somebody else, and I can understand that.  AR: And why do you think that is? Why do you think that happens?  JC: I don’t know because they’re certainly vocal. This is certainly a vocal community. I can remember back when one of my aunts lived in what we’d now consider to be public housing. She lived in an old row house, which has now turned into public housing. And I can remember back, it wasn’t an African-America community, it was just a low income. People saying, what would they do with it? Why give them anything, what would they do with it? And is that still the perception we have? I don’t know.  AR: Yeah, Sabrina Baker-Bouie and Norma Jean Walker talked a lot about that in our interview. It’s interesting.  JC: We tore the African-American communities’ heart out when we tore up Overtown. When we ran 95 through that, certainly that was well before my time, but we all saw that in any community we grew up in. We all saw 95 come through the heart of the community. And when we ripped that out, when we did that, we destroyed a thriving middle class neighborhood commercially, and private housing. So, did we ever do anything to make up for that? Is that where all that started? Is that where the civil unrest started? Granted it all happened at a time that the United States was at war and we were having civil unrest here in the United States, it was a whole different thing and you’re too young to remember that. But, was it all at the same time and did we just say, “this is progress?” And really, is it progress? You destroy a community and then what do you do? Then you just let everybody else in so that the communities are polarized. You drive through 23  Jane Caporelli  July 13, 1999  Overtown, it’s certainly not what Overtown was thirty years ago. Nothing is what anything was thirty years ago. But, is Overtown beyond coming back?  AR: It’s absolutely tragic.  JC: Well, if you read in the paper the other day about the Forty-niner’s from Booker T. Washington, which was the graduating class of 1949, fifty years ago. I’m very friendly with Enid Pinkney, who I’m sure is going to be one of your, Enid Johnson Pinkney who is the president at Heritage Trust and she was the president of student council. And I guess they were one of the last years that Booker T. was a senior high and it was the black school. They are an amazing group of graduates from that class, they’re amazing people. And that was their community. So you wonder how things would be different if that hadn’t happened.  AR: I was very impressed, a few years ago, I was at the [Unclear] Center. I went to the black archives there, and I pulled one of their old school pamphlets outlining all the programs and the mission of the school. It was such an incredible focus, and such a wealth of education. The way that all the programs were structured was incredible.  JC: But there was still that—Enid tells the story about how, because they do a big commemorative service every year at the cemetery, which is my favorite part of Dade Heritage Days. She tells the story about how it was kind of a full circle, because the Miami Women’s Club donated money to the commemorative service and years ago she was at Booker T. Washington, they went to a program at the Women’s Club, but they wouldn’t let them have lunch there, because they were black. So they would have to walk back to Booker T. for lunch, and then walk back to the Women’s Club. That’s beyond my comprehension. She also tells the story that when she was installed as the president of Dade Heritage Trust we did it at the Gusman, and she said that as a little girl she used to walk by the Gusman and wonder what was inside because she wasn’t allowed inside. So, it’s kind of a different thing than what we grew up with.  AR: Something that was stuck in the back of my mind, moving back to parks. You mentioned that sometimes Overtown kids would come over and use the pool here. Do they come a lot?  24  Jane Caporelli  July 13, 1999  JC: Only when their pool is broken.  AR: One of the things that Sabrina Baker-Bouie was talking about was that a lot of groups from this neighborhood, from Little Havana, go and use the baseball fields in Gibson Park. There’s that constant clash there, there’s that constant resentment there. And I was just curious—  JC: The kids from this neighborhood, at one time, when they were bussing them, and I’m not sure if it was kindergarten, first, second, third, went to Frederick Douglass and the kids from Overtown went to Riverside. And then four, five, and six were at Riverside and then the little kids were at Douglass and the big kids were at Riverside. So the kids from each neighborhood would go into each neighborhood. You would think that there would be better communications between them because they were in each other’s neighborhoods, but that doesn’t seem to be the case. The kids, they do a lot of, I don’t know if its POW, or Explorers, I know the Y does it too, they use the basketball courts here. So the kids come in and out of here, they have games here. I’ve never seen or heard that there’s been any clashes here. I always thought that the playing fields were [unclear] fields, but I guess not.  AR: I imagine, like you’ve mentioned, the language barrier is one that’s very hard to overcome.  JC: Most of the kids in this neighborhood learn Spanish as a second language. English isn’t even thought of at that point.  AR: So, not necessarily. You think there could be better communication. You think it’s feasible, it’s just not happening.  JC: I don’t see why it wouldn’t be feasible. Kids are kids. Kids grow up thinking that everybody’s the same and they only learn all those negative things from people around them.  AR: So you wouldn’t venture a guess as to why it’s not happening?  JC: I don’t know.  25  Jane Caporelli  July 13, 1999  AR: Is there anything else you wanted to say about Riverside Park or Henderson Park?  JC: I just think it was a shame when they took half of the park for the mental health center. I think the Y’s tried very, very hard to instill programs in them. They do an after school program at Henderson, where they do a healthy kid kind of program where they get physicals at [Unclear] and they also do soccer or whatever it is and we also do a gardening part of it. We’ve done a summer camp program at Jose Marti with the kids in the neighborhood, because there really wasn’t any organized camp. It was just kind of whenever they dropped in. And the Y does an amazing camp, they do a wonderful job with the kids. And Riverside they really don’t deal with, that’s mostly the baseball teams usually use that. There was a game problem at Riverside. For some reason they don’t touch the kids when they’re playing baseballs, it’s like those are off limits. I don’t think we have enough parks here. I think we can have better programming in them. Parks should be open to anybody that wants to use them, not only those who can afford them. And they should be easily accessible. In this neighborhood, there’s a lot of non-car-owning families, they should be able to walk to a park. There should be little pocket parks all throughout this neighborhood. In an ideal world I’m sure that’s how it would be. But it’s not. We have to build on every square inch that we can, and that’s distressing.  AR: What do you think the barriers are in terms of improving—right now, specifically, elected officials – Do you think there’s a growing awareness amongst politicians on the importance of parks or do you think they are obstacles?  JC: I think in some instances they are obstacles. I know that we’ve gone to some about increasing park space and housing has always been out there. “No, we need the space for housing.” I think to a point they are. I can understand on one hand where you need to increase the tax base for a city that has financial difficulties, but I can also understand on the other hand where building more housing isn’t the solution either. Maybe we under-utilize the parks we have or maybe we don’t use them properly. But a park should be both just open, green space for somebody to go and sit on a picnic blanket if that’s what they want to do, but also to be able to throw a Frisbee, or bring their kid in the morning in the summer and know that there’s going to be a program for them and they’re going to be safe, and they’re going to be challenged, and they’re going to have fun, and they’re going to increase their social skills. And that’s what a park should be. It should be a lot of 26  Jane Caporelli  July 13, 1999  different things and we don’t have enough space here to be all those different things. When the kids play soccer in this park, there’s really not a whole lot of space to do much else. So I think that we don’t have enough park space to be able to do all that good stuff.  AR: So is it a problem, then, that you think realistically can be addressed in those regards? Is it a fact that we should have to live with that we don’t have enough space to do these things, or is there something that can be done about that?  JC: I’m sure there is. I don’t know how to go about it. The Trust Republican(?) does amazing things in the neighborhood groups that all really trust to put land in Trust Republic use. They are here. I don’t know that that’s the mindset in Miami. We’re a metropolitan city with a small town attitude. I don’t know. Yes, some of the public officials certainly have been an obstacle, I think. And I don’t know how you change their thought process. All I know is some of it’s changed to a point.  AR: Is there anybody in specific that’s been a problem, or is there anybody in specific that has been helpful?  JC: No, a lot of people have been helpful. Certainly. Jimmy Morales certainly knows what parks are. Katie Sorenson. “Art” Teele has a wonderful vision as far as that goes. Joe Sanchez, I think that coming from a law enforcement background understands the importance of programs for kids. So, I think there are certain ones that, yes, do understand that. There are others that, I don’t know, they don’t really get it.  AR: Not getting into specifics of names of those people who don’t get it, but why don’t you think they get it?  JC: I think everyone has their own agenda. I think that some of our commissioners—Some maybe immigration is their big agenda, or maybe building housing is their big agenda. Maybe that’s the only way to get the homeless off the streets is to put them in housing. You’ve got to fix the issues they deal with on a day-to-day basis. I don’t know.  27  Jane Caporelli  July 13, 1999  AR: You mentioned that [Unclear], he has made big strides and you see it continuing, you’re relatively optimistic about the future of Jose Marti Park, if I’m not mistaken. Would you have the same sentiment about Henderson Park or about Riverside Park?  JC: I don’t go to Riverside Park all that often. I think it will be a whole different issue when the school is done up there. When they finish, when they redo it and enlarge it it’s going to be an elementary school, so I’m sure the park will be used more. It’s just basically a baseball diamond and a little park space around it. Henderson, I think since the Y has done this after-school program, the tennis courts are still there, not all of them, I think it’s had different use than it had been previously.  AR: Different in terms of greater diversity of program?  JC: Henderson had a lot of “hanger-arounders”, a lot of homeless. And I think with more use, there’s a lot less of that.  AR: Now, that’s a sense I’ve been getting a lot from people, it’s kind of a catch-22. People don’t use parks because they’re perceived as places where there is negative activity, but once people start using them, the activity is not there. I asked you if you felt the commissioners or the politicians were more aware of parks and spaces. Do you think the community in general, it’ll be a two-stage question, the Little Havana community in general, and then I’ll ask again the same question for the [unclear] Miami community in general is more aware of parks, it is of late.  JC: We had a neighborhood group in this neighborhood called Vecinos en Accion, Neighbors in Action, who took a very positive stand on cleaning up the neighborhood, cleaning up the park and doing that. They kind of faltered along the way in their own internal issues. I think this neighborhood, it’s really nice to see the kids playing in the park. Parents have been probably made more aware of the parks because of the Y summer camps. Like I said before, the involvement in this neighborhood, I think that if people on Twelfth Avenue didn’t have to walk all the way to Jose Marti, if there was something a little bit closer to them, it would make a big difference. As far as Miami as a whole, we are an outdoor community. I think that people have become more aware of their parks in the past few years more than they were before. Maybe they 28  Jane Caporelli  July 13, 1999  have more leisure time, maybe the people who are on the fast track are finally having children and having a place to have them run. I think that you see more people in the parks. Like you said, it’s a catch-22. People were saying, well Lummis Park, it’s open and it’s not open, it’s terrible and it’s this and it’s that, but would they be the ones to go to Lummis Park on a Tuesday afternoon? You know, because it’s dangerous there. If more people are there, then the ones we don’t want there are going to think twice about being there.  AR: I was talking to Joe Triana about a month ago, one of the police officers over there, and he was talking about how he feels that people feel it’s a much safer neighborhood now and that the mounted police has made a big difference.  JC: I think that whole concept has made a difference. I think the community policing and group policing has made a big, big difference in Miami. Just to be able to put an angel police officer. It makes a whole difference just enough knowing that there’s a continuity and they know who’s supposed to be on that corner, or they know who’s supposed to be someplace. It makes a big, big difference. It really makes a difference.  AR: Let me see how much time we have left. A little bit. I’ll ask one last question or two. We’ve talked a lot about parks in terms of the neighborhoods, in terms of Miami. What other public spaces of that nature do you think are important to Miami that maybe we do have, and you see as helpful, or we don’t have, in other words museums, beaches, libraries, zoos?  JC: I think the public library, Miami art museum, and the historical museum were a wonderful idea to put them all together in a plaza. They’re not people-friendly from the street. Bayside is not people-friendly. It’s a wonderful waterfront and it’s a nice family place to go. I don’t know that we’ve developed Bayfront Park the way we should. It’s a shame to drive by there at night and see the gates locked up and without [unclear]. Those could be wonderful places to spend time.  AR: How do you make something like the library, museum in that plaza more people-friendly?  JC: I don’t know. It’s the walls, it’s just all walls on the street level.  29  Jane Caporelli  July 13, 1999  AR: The architecture of it?  JC: Yeah. There’s nothing street-level to make it attractive. The only thing street-level are these service entrances. I think that’s a problem. You walk by and see the signs but you don’t really click in what it is.  AR: And how about Bayside? Same thing, the layout of it?  JC: Just the layout, just the layout. Through the water it’s wonderful, but when you go through the street-level it’s really not an open, friendly place.  AR: Any other thoughts on that last question?  JC: No.  AR: Well, thank you very, very much for doing this Jane. I really appreciate it.  JC: You’re welcome.

The date is July 8, 1999, and we are beginning the interview at 11:56. The topics of discussion will be Ms. Walker’s perceptions of Overtown, having lived and worked there, and how they relate to public space issues and other issues that may come up. So, OK, thank you for being here, for doing this. I’m going to put this closer to you.  Norma Jean Walker: I still live in Overtown.  AR: You still live in Overtown? Great. OK, so, I guess let’s just start off at the beginning. Could you give us your date of birth and where you were born?  NW: OK, I was born October 4, 1947 in a small town called Hillyard, Florida. It’s about thirty-two miles from Jacksonville, Florida.  AR: OK, and were you raised there, or did you--?  NW: I was raised in Hillyard. I came to Miami when I was eighteen years old in 1966.  AR: What did your parents do for a living?  NW: Well, my mother was a domestic engineer, you know. Back then they called them maids. And my father was a, worked in railroads. He was a railroad worker. He went from town to town, you know, working on the tracks and repairing what was broken, taking up the cross-ties and putting them down.  AR: So, and why did they decide to move to Miami?  NW: Not my parents. Only me.  Norma Jean Walker  July 8, 1999  3  AR: Only you?  NW: Only me. I had two older sisters here, and I left, I went to college. And I just, didn’t complete my first year and I came to Miami.  AR: How would you characterize your childhood?  NW: Very happy. Very loving, you know, a very loving and caring family. Lot to do. Very spiritual, we had a lot of spiritual things to do. We had fun. We had ball in the road. My mom played ball with us. We went to church every Sunday. We went to school. Never missed a day from school, unless we had to be really, really sick. And during the summertime, there was no summer school. We had, our summer school was fun. We didn’t go to school just to make up grades, because we had to do it year-round when school was out. And we did very well. I graduated, in my class, I finished number three, and we all finished high school. Mom and Dad had three children, two boys and a girl.  AR: So, could you describe the neighborhood that you were raised in? What it was like?  NW: Well, it was like, a lot of land, a lot of houses that [were] was, like, far apart, not like in Miami where it is so close together. It was like, you may see a house here, and you may go like, for example, like five blocks, another house right there, and then you might go another five blocks and see, like, three houses together. But there was a lot of land. We had a field; in the field we’d plant vegetables every year. Like one neighbor would plant corn. We did, like, the peas and the greens and different things for the, during planting time. But it was a lot of land, a lot of fun. It wasn’t, no congestion, there was no street bus, you know, like you catch the bus and go downtown. There [were] was no taxis. Nothing like that, you know, it wasn’t anything like that.  AR: So there was really, I mean, there was no, were there parks and, or it was so much natural space that--?  Norma Jean Walker  July 8, 1999  4  NW: It was natural spaces. We played ball in the road. The road was big enough to play ball, and there was no parks. I can’t remember a park when I was growing up.  AR: [laughing]  NW: Nope. We had to go twelve miles from my hometown to another town for school because it, during that time, it was segregation, it wasn’t integration. So we didn’t go to school in the same town where we lived at, because [it was] all-white schools, and during that time, blacks didn’t go to all-white schools. So we, all the surrounding areas from the small cities, we caught the bus and went to a school in Callahan, Florida called Pine Forest Union High School.  AR: Growing up there, was there, you mentioned it was segregated of course, was there a lot of tension, or did the ( )--?  NW: No, no, no. Everybody knew everybody. Every white person knew every black person. There [were] was some people that [were] was very, very prejudiced and it showed, and they would show it. And there was some that didn’t even care. They knew whose child you was, who your mother was, because the town was small, so everybody knew whose child belonged to who[m]. One thing we didn’t do, we couldn’t, like, sit on the stand at the drugstore because that still was not integrated yet. We went to the grocery store, and we shopped where everybody shopped, you know. When you got on the bus, you know, when the Greyhound bus came through Hillyard to go to Jacksonville, we sat in the back of the bus. [unidentified noise] But otherwise, everything else was OK, you know. There was not like no-- I remember years when I was young, hearing my parents tell me about a cross being burned in one lady’s yard, you know, in our town. When a politician ran for office, they would have, like, a big fish fry, you know, in this big open field, and they would have music, and we would all come out, you know. And they would encourage, blacks always voted. There was a heavy turn-out back then, allowed to vote. There was a very heavy turn-out, and, it wasn’t like women voted more then men. Who all could vote, voted.  AR: Interesting. And there was never any attempt to control that, or--. Norma Jean Walker  July 8, 1999  5  NW: Not to my knowledge--.  AR: Not to your knowledge?  NW: Not to my knowledge. I’m not saying a lot of things went on behind the closed doors. Not to my knowledge. You know, we had a Sheriff Youngblood for many, many years. He was sheriff, I think, until he got just too old to be the sheriff. You know, of the whole county, Nassau County. So, I don’t think--.  AR: Well, since ultimately we’ll be talking about leisure activity and public spaces in Miami, or in Overtown, could you give me a sense of what—you know, you mentioned that you have a lot of fun—could you describe sort of what leisure activities that you did in Hillyard?  NW: Well in Hillyard, you know, we can play, we can play freely. You know, we can play ball. We can have music. We can take out, we can go fishing. We can plant. We can have nice beautiful gardens. We can have our fence put up. We can visit neighbors. We just could shop. But, and it’s like—and the neighbors [were] was neighbors. Like, you got along. The neighbors knew each other. When something happened, you know, you didn’t have to fight for territory. There was no fighting for territory. You had your land, you paid your tax, that was it. You know, but now it’s not, I don’t find that here in Miami. And since 1973, there’s like been a big change.  AR: I’ll definitely talk about that--.  NW: When I first came here, it was different. It was more like home when I first came here.  AR: Huh?  NW: Well, you know, but now, it’s like, really sad.  Norma Jean Walker  July 8, 1999  6  AR: Was there—institutions were segregated, businesses and stuff—were the neighborhoods segregated in terms of housing? In other words, was there a black portion of housing and then a white--?  NW: Yes, when I grew up--.  AR: So...  NW: Yes there was. There was a black section of blacks, and section where whites lived. And then you, like, we lived on this side of this highway, and when you cross over to this side, there’s a white section, but as you went down, you crossed, like, ten blocks you went into another black section, you know. It was, like, quarters. You had, like, this end, this end, you know. One quarter they called it Turpentine Quarter because they ( ) turpentine to make different stuff with. And they had a Sawmill, where they did a sawmill, and they did, you know, mill grinding and stuff.  AR: Did the children of both communities play together?  NW: Of course we played together.  AR: Whites and black kids?  NW: Yeah, we played together. Because, remember now, that many women back then would baby-sit.  AR: Right.  NW: So, a lot of time they bring the parents, the children to the parents’ house. And either the child, the mother went to the child’s house. If that white child’s mother had to work later, or come in late, the mother would bring the child home to her house so she could fix dinner for her children, and they’d play together. Norma Jean Walker  July 8, 1999  7  AR: OK, well let’s for now—let me come back to Hillyard later-- for now let’s move to Overtown then, when you first moved down. Could you describe what the neighborhood was like?  NW: The neighborhood was very friendly, very close. Everybody looked out for each other. It was like a neighborly neighborhood. I came to Miami and I became a waitress, and everybody knew you. Your customers knew you. You knew what your customers liked. And, you know, when they came in for their meal, you got to know them, you know, to bring a glass or water or not to bring a glass of water. You knew to bring some, like, corned beef and grits. But people [were] was very friendly. And your neighborhood where you lived at, nobody broke in[to] your house, and they’d look out for your children. When you had to go to work, they had a babysitter right there in the building. But now, it’s that, you can play in the park, the kids play ball in the road, then come home. I remember Gibson Park, it wasn’t Gibson Park then, it was called Dixie Park. And it was, you can go play, live the hump. We had, what you call, Overtown come alive, I mean they had the classical parade on FAMU ( )--.  ?: [in background] ( ).  NW: You had, Second Avenue was booming, you know. We had fun. We had the clubs everybody could go to, like you had the Sir John, you had the Rocking Palace, you had the Classic Lounge—small lounge on ( )—you had the Stone Drugstore. You had different kinds of cafeterias, restaurants. You had the Ball Fish restaurant. You had the Chinese restaurant. You had, I mean, it just was, you had doctors in the neighborhood. You had your own doctor. You had a GYN, Dr. Henry. You had a dentist there. You had a medical doctor. Your had Dr. Checkov, he was of another descent. He wasn’t black, but he was, like, a friendly doctor. We had a clothing store there. We had Jack’s Clothing Store. We had a tailor there. We had a grocery store. We had so many things where, it was like, you didn’t have to go out of your neighborhood. All of the money stayed in the neighborhood, and people that lived in the neighborhood, worked in the neighborhood. So you didn’t have to go out of the neighborhood to make money. Those who worked down in Miami Beach, they’d have a car to get in and back, but basically we stayed in the neighborhood and Norma Jean Walker  July 8, 1999  8  worked. I worked in the neighborhood, so I got to know everybody. We had a fish market neighborhood. But now, it’s like a big change.  AR: You know, you describe a very vibrant community, which I also heard described--.  NW: Very, very economic. We had money. So, if you didn’t have to pay bus fare, so you are going to save $2.50 a day. So that money, instead of going out of our neighborhood, could stay in your house, where you pay rent, you know. And the landlords were much better. They [weren’t] wasn’t like slum landlords there, they just want the money, the rent is higher for less, you know, investment. And plus, you’re don’t get a lot of care. They don’t come back and repair the plumbing. They don’t want to cut the trees. They don’t want to fix the lighting. They just don’t want to do anything. They don’t want to paint the building. They don’t want to fix the ( ) when they fall out. So it’s like that’s why there a good name for them is slum landlord.  AR: Were the people who owned, were the landowners back then, did they live in the neighborhood?  NW: No, they took a tenant within the building and they became the manager of the apartment building. So anything that went wrong, they kept it clean. They kept the yard clean, they kept the apartment taken care of. If the toilet stopped up, the manager would come out there that same night and do it right then. He had his agenda of what he had to do.  AR: I’ve read, listened to your description, and also reading Marvin Dunn’s description of, in his book on blacks in Miami of Second Avenue, of their very vibrant life. Could you give me a sense of what it was like on a typical day, not a typical weekday, a typical weekend on the streets? The sorts of activities that went on the--?  NW: Well, during the day I remember when, as I remember it, that people went about their business, going to work. If you went down Second Avenue between Tenth Street and, I remember very well, between Sixth Street, that’s where Jack’s Clothing Store was, and the Norma Jean Walker  July 8, 1999  9  tailor’s, and different shops, and a poolroom where the kids, where the guys shot, you know, were shooting pool. But what I do remember was that one lady that was a worker at Jack���s Clothing Store, her name was Farrah Stein, she would stand outside and have a sale sign, you know, what was on sale. And Mr. Jack, who was a white man who owned the store, was very involved with the community. He would be out there too, you know ( ). Miss Maple was his nurse. And she would, like, come out there every night and day, and, you know, she would, “Look, you going to go in there, you’re going to have to wait no whole long time.” And we had a doctor’s office who was on the Second Avenue also, he was, like, take your, medical doctor, you saw it is, like, GYN also. Dr. Henry was our GYN doctor. He delivered my second child. And we had Dr. Miro. We had, Dr. Davis was a dentist, and he was, his sister was right there on Second Avenue when she lived in Coconut Grove, but he brought all his expertise to the Overtown area. Right on, and during the day you had the cab stand. You didn’t have to go, like, wave down and call for a cab. You just walked to Eleventh Street and that’s the site of the cab stand, and you get the jitney stop, and the cab was right there. And right around the corner was Frenchy, which was the ice cream store, where they sold the best homemade ice cream and sausage sandwich, you know. And the businessmen came out on the sidewalk, and they, “Hi, how’re you doing?” You know, you had Clyde Kitlin, who was still [in] Overtown, and you have Moore’s Garage, and you have the little baby Cohens, and Mr. Cohen would come by and wave and speak. They would come open their place in the morning so if anyone needed a cold drink, or a cold soda, or cold ice cream, or whatever, a nice hot biscuit and grits, it was always available. And they made you feel so welcome when you came in. They wanted you to come, not just get your money, you know, you felt welcome. On Second Avenue, like, a guy would tell you in the morningtime, 4:30, hurry up and get to work, you know. There was no danger. I didn’t feel any danger as I walked the street to work on Second Avenue, and I would have to be at to work at 4:30, and I, although I lived a block and a half from work, I didn’t feel no danger, because all the customers, all the guys on the street knew me, all the ladies knew me. And, it wasn’t like, you had to be afraid to walk down Second Avenue. There was just so much love, you could feel it, you know, and it was so vibrant. Everybody got ready for their class. Everybody got ready for Christmas, you know, everybody got ready for anything, you know, and even during death, during that time, everybody got together and made sure that each Norma Jean Walker  July 8, 1999  10  family was supported, that that family had what they needed, that that child had what they needed. Every neighbor watched out for each other’s child, you know, it wasn’t like, people didn’t prey on the poor as much as they do now. Come in your neighborhood and just prey on you, you know. Sell high products and not good products, you know, and just move out. It was more like a family, you know, like just closer. And now it���s not that feeling, it not that, there’s no feeling in a lot of areas of Overtown. As if though you had, you know, you can apply for a job, you can’t apply for jobs in Overtown now. There’s no job service. It’s as if though the politicians forget about Overtown until it’s time for election, then they come in—not all of them, but not the ones that run for our district, for their own districts themselves—but a lot of them will come in Overtown and promise you the whole world and once you elect them you never see them again. Like, there’s no accountability from the city and the county when it comes to HUD. The housing are all abandoned, HUD housing, like, you got like, a hundred some HUD apartments abandoned, and the county and city are not being accountable for it. And they move black folks out, down to Homestead, different areas when you need somewhere to go. They just like, dismantled the whole community, and they’re not responsible for keeping the city, maintaining the community. Where in the past you would find that people kept the streets swept, the trash picked up, light bulbs in, but nowadays they don’t maintain, don’t trim the trees, you almost have to, like, just call ninety-nine people before you get an answer. And then you get like a, what you call those, Band-Aid answers. When it rains, streets flood, you call ninety-nine times, they don’t fix it, you know. It’s that, even, the people in the community become frustrated and begin to move out to a better neighborhood, what they call a better neighborhood, which Overtown is a very rich, great neighborhood. And I realize that a politician would know it’s rich, but they just want to keep it that way, so they can come in and benefit from the profit once most of the blacks have moved out.  AR: I definitely want to come back to that a little later. I want to explore a little more the Overtown of back then. You mentioned a couple of things, of events. One is the classes--.  NW: The class is around December, around December-time, with FAMU, which is the college, and another college would come to Miami and play in the Orange Bowl. And the Norma Jean Walker  July 8, 1999  11  street be, the street on the Second end would be so packed. The Dorsey Hotel was there during that time. We had all the clubs, you know, we had Lane’s Guest House, they had the Carvel Hotel where they stayed. We had our own black hotel. No more. It’s been promising for years to come back to Overtown, nothing yet. You know, the Dorsey House had been remodeled, restored, but it’s falling apart again. There’s a lot of rich history there and for, like Dorsey Library’s all closed down. It’s like there’s so much in Overtown where it would take not much money, people willing to do, but there’s some reason that when money’s allocated for the Overtown area, it never gets there. There’s always a hold-up, which I feel that when the money’s allocated for the rich history that we had in the past, it should be like, when you allocate $10,000,000, you should have a year to spend it, because you know, we’re going to use it. It’s not like we’re going to say, you know, we got $10,000,000 we’re going to decide what we’re going to use it for. We know what we need it for. We need housing, we need better streets, we need better lights. And you see, Overtown’s a very black area now because they keep it very dark, even around the community’s center. You have to go out of the community just to be certified for food stamps. Now they decided that they may bring it back, you know. We’re not accessible. People [who] don’t look like us, could come into Overtown and get a business overnight, and stock it overnight. People who, in the past, when I first came, it wasn’t that way. You had people that owned the building, owned the building, let us work the business. We worked and there was pride in who was working. The men who was porters, who worked in the dock, who worked in the airport, and there was waiters in restaurant, they dressed in black and white. You took pride on going to St. Clair Cafeteria in Hialeah, working, and coming back home. You took pride in it, you know. And the role model is in your home. But now, when you have a man who can’t find a job, or no one will give him a job, and he [has] have children, his wife [has] got to go to work or be on public assistance, you know, what this is. So, it’s like a lot of things [were] was taken away. It’s taken away, so you know, so that we can’t have any. You know, it’s easy to get business back. You had an empty building, you had a business. Now, no. What I find about Overtown in the government and the ones who do, as far as the business section is concerned if I may, that they have no problem bringing a liquor store in Overtown. They’ll do it real quick. Anything that will help, like computer centers, job programs, they brought a bank. We finally got a bank there. The shopping center in Overtown is like a big joke, you know. Norma Jean Walker  July 8, 1999  12  People who get business don’t live in Overtown. They don’t even live at all in Overtown. But they get the business faster than people live in Overtown.  AR: Could you give us a sense of how that mechanism works? Why it is that it’s hard for people that live in Overtown to get businesses and just sort of give me an idea of what the barriers are?  NW: Honest opinion, and I say it now until the day that I leave this earth, people are placed in Overtown to help us, but they are placed in there to help us, but they are not helping us! They are placed in Overtown, but they are not working for the Overtown. You understand?  AR: And why is that? Because--?  NW: Because that’s, I feel that’s the plan. I feel there’s a plan that people send people into Overtown to hold position in Overtown, to be leaders in Overtown. So-called directors of different agencies. And they sit there, so nothing will happen in Overtown. Because if you’re in Overtown, and you have an office in Overtown, you ought to make sure that everything is kept maintained and clean and safe. It shouldn’t be a no problem for you to come right out and cut a tree if it’s in the middle of a light. Or fix a light bulb. You shouldn’t have to call no fifteen times or bring the person out, you know, and show him the light, and it still don’t get fixed. That’s what I had to do several times. Several times! And it takes a while for it to get done. And the garbage can runs over, and the lot be overrun. If you ride through Overtown on a rainy day, you’ll see the flood. You’ll ride through and say, now why is all these buildings abandoned? Why does it look this way? And you got an office in Overtown, who is doing code enforcement. So who is doing the code enforcement? And, then you complain, and you go to meetings, you go to community meetings, you complain, you raise your hand. They have studied us to death. Overtown needs not to be studied any more. [pause] Overtown needs no, it’s been studied enough. What we need to do is take the money that you’ve been studying with and just start rebuilding the buildings, you know, build some homes. And see, government is very smart, but ladies like me are very smart too. Home ownership is very important, and they know that. So once they don’t Norma Jean Walker  July 8, 1999  13  build homes in Overtown, there’s no home ownership. And if we had like, I say, about thirty-five more homes in Overtown, single-family homes, it’d be a big difference and the government knows that. So they start doing inferior housing, they don’t put them in Overtown.  AR: Do you attribute that to, what, to racism, to economic interests, to--?  NW: I attribute it to people who work in Overtown, just really don’t care. They’re not working for the community. Because if you got a community behind you, and you’re fighting for better lighting, better business, and your people are behind you, all you got to do is well look, I got this lady who wants to open up a laundry, a dollar store, or whatever. We want to help her. But you can’t. The lease is like for thirty days for the shopping center. Now who’s going to put $2000 worth of materials, I mean merchandise for a thirty day lease? You won’t find another community. I have, I ride down Thirty-Sixth Street. I ride in the Hispanic community, and I see what they got, look at the shopping center own by the ( ) Center. Look at that shopping center and look at Overtown’s shopping center.  AR: And, so do you think it’s—I’m trying to phrase the question—so you think it’s a lack of interest?  NW: It’s a lack of-- it’s the wrong people working in the community.  AR: Yeah.  NW: You understand what I’m saying?  AR: Yeah.  NW: You have to take ownership in what you’re doing. If you go into a community to work, you must go into there wanting to make a difference. If you’ve been there for a while, and you’re not making a difference, then something is wrong. If you got residents like me Norma Jean Walker  July 8, 1999  14  complaining about the same thing as a simple light, speeding up and down Third Avenue—most of it done by police officers—and you complain about it, and no one never helps you, what do that say to you? It does not get to your desk. It may get from your desk to the garbage can, but it doesn’t get anywhere else. And, our commissioner for our area, our politicians for our area, for Overtown, are doing all they can. But they are being fought, and they are being knocked down left and right, and they are being fought. And if we the community stand behind them, but then you got an agency in Overtown who’s not standing behind them. The business got to stand behind them. The business doesn’t look like us. So they’re being benefited, they get the insurance, the get the bulk buying. Overtown, the black businesses have a hard time getting it. And if a black guy stands on a corner, or drive on the corner, they arrest him, they harass him. If other guys come to our community, if a different color, they won’t stop him. So, it’s like a catch-22, you know, you do if you don’t. And people that work in Overtown, I say it constantly and I say it again, and I will say it forever, they’re not working for Overtown. There’s some people in Overtown, and they are working for Overtown, but it’s like three.  AR: Who are they? Who would you say?  NW: Well, I say that Sabrina Baker-Bouie is one of them. I would think that Miss Bouie would make a, she was making a great impact in Overtown. We had a marketplace the first Saturday of every month, we had a big marketplace on Ninth Street, the first Saturday of every month, where everybody came together and sold their goods like a marketplace. Residents got used to that. We had fun. We had rides for the children. And since she left, no more.  AR: She did describe--.  NW: We had a flower garden. We had a community garden. We had people doing tutoring. We had parents getting together. A lot was going on. But now since she left, the Eighth Street has grown up. Dr. Dunn, Fourteenth Street is still pretty. And Gibson Park, which is a Norma Jean Walker  July 8, 1999  15  big park in Overtown, one of the biggest parks in Overtown, it’s that, when it’s used by other people that don’t live in our community.  AR: Yeah, Ms. Bouie mentioned that to me--.  NW: The Nicaraguans come in. The Hispanics come in. They play soccer. They play ( ), they play volleyball, they take advantage of the park. They sell anything they want to sell. They have cars all down Fourteenth. But the minute, the minute that the blacks have something in Overtown, the police officers get out of their cars, and tell you to turn your music off. You can’t have parties, you can’t enjoy yourself. I think it should be a limited time they turn it off, and how loud it should be, but they like stand [unidentified noise] ( ) and look at you in a way to intimidate you.  AR: And they don’t do that with Hispanics?  NW: No. They got out of the car and talk to the players, and have fun, and drink stuff, I think soda, you know. [coughing]  AR: Are there, could you give me an idea of—let’s talk about Gibson Park—are there any programs there for the community?  NW: No.  AR: None?  NW: There’s none. And I remember when I first came, when I was first going to Gibson Park, they had a karate class there. I took karate. They had the--.  AR: This is when you first came here?  NW: It was like in the seventies. Norma Jean Walker  July 8, 1999  16  AR: In the seventies?  NW: After seventy-three, something happened. I mean, something began to happen. You know, that people just didn’t care anymore. You had great park management. One was Emmanuel Washington, great park manager. You had our sensei Jesse Beat, great karate teacher. We did, we had arts and crafts, you know, we made pyramids and stuff. The kids, after-care. Barbara was there, you know. We had Karen ( ) who was a great native of Overtown. She was involved. We had aerobic dancing. We had tennis. We had fun. The park was filled with young black children and their families, you know. Like, I was in the park taking karate, and my sons was outside practicing snatch-rag or whatever, you know. But now it’s that Optimist Club is like a big, it’s the Optimist Club but it’s not like, I don’t know, something is missing. Something is missing.  AR: Do you have any sense of what is missing?  NW: What is missing is that it’s hard to get things for the children to have, like the uniforms. We should have uniforms. Make sure they’re acceptable to the park. And, could I just ( ) for a second?  AR: Yeah, of course. [unidentified noise] OK, so back then in the seventies, and before seventy-three, you had these things?  NW: We had a football team. We had football teams in Overtown. We had Bugtown. We had Swamp City. We had Twenty-Second Avenue. Twenty-Second Street where they played football. And every weekend, somebody had a big football team. Where football players [unidentified noise] and the park was booming, just booming. We had Stone Drugstore with Dr. Sidney Cox the pharmacist, where he had the ice cream and the punch. And it was just booming, we had fun. I mean, people had somewhere to go, you know. And, it seemed like all that love was there, you know. We had furniture stores in Overtown that during the night after the riot, a lot of them got burned down the night of the riot, but you could still see that something was trying to happen again. But Overtown coming alive, it Norma Jean Walker  July 8, 1999  17  stopped. You know, money became so short, and I don’t know what could have happened just that, people kind of like, someone gave up hope. But many, many of us still have hope. And every time you want to build something, this piece of land belonged to this person and they want to sell it to this person for this much money, you know like, and that’s why you can’t build. When we went about building an open building for a business, they find us a code wrong. But the Arabs could walk into Overtown and open a building and sell anything they want to sell. And it’s fine. And, there’s something wrong with this whole place, too.  AR: Yeah.  NW: There’s something wrong. See there’s no accountability. Nobody is being held responsible here for what our community should be having. Our residents, our children. So, if I skip into the community and say what I feel, it’s like, OK, we’re going to do it. When the city manager comes into, when our meetings, and says, “OK you going to take care of things.” I say, “I’ll hold you to it.” And he said, “I know you will.” And he still don’t do it, you know what I’m saying? So, it’s that, they bring false hope, but they share hope while they’re sharing, but they’re really bringing you false hope. It’s like a Band-Aid to pacify you, OK you be quiet for a little while, and you’ll be OK, and I think we’re pretty tired of it.  AR: So, you, let me see how much longer, I was going to ask another question, I think we have a little more tape. [pause]. Well, I have a couple questions I want to ask you, we only have a little bit of time left though, um, hmm. Well, let me ask you about this, parks, back then in the seventies. You considered them, did you consider them safe places--?  NW: Safe places, accessible, fun, well-lit.  AR: Yeah. And now?  NW: Now, dark, not accessible, but maybe when they weren’t to be. One summer the pool was not open, next summer the pool opened. Nowhere to walk. You want to remodel the parks so we can walk around our park, go for a walk, like a walking club, you know. We Norma Jean Walker  July 8, 1999  18  would get together and walk and exercise. [pause] Nobody sits down to their desk when you’re giving these ideas in Overtown and says, let’s do this! They take Williams Park and make it a park where the senior citizens or the young people want to go for a walk, like at Moore’s Park. And you can go to community, you can just raise your voice and just share that, how you feel about that, and it’s the same old thing.  AR: Do you see any hope, any improvement?  NW: If you move some of the people that’s [are] working in Overtown out of there, yes. But if you put somebody in there who really want to see things happen. Some people don’t want to see things happen, and I think that’s there intention to be there, so nothing happens!  AR: Yeah.  NW: If you make a man or a woman, empower them, they can buy their own Christmas toys for their children! They don’t need to go out, ride around in police cars and fire trucks and give them toys. It’s good to do it, but if you give them a job and hire them, empower them, you won’t need to [do] that. What you would say that this family moved into a home. Or this family’s child made the honor roll. Or this father got employee of the month. They want to see, we don’t want to see, well, we gave this child some toys because the father lives underprivileged. We’re all at risk. The whole world is at risk.

He is a World War II veteran and worked as a pilot for Eastern Airlines. Mr. Trainer’s interest in public spaces goes back to the 1980’s when he started an environmental protection group, the Greater Panama Area Conservation Society (G-PACS). He describes his childhood in the small town of Panama City, his flight training in the army, the changes that occurred in Panama City after the war and his efforts to preserve the historical sites and public parks of his native town.

Today I am going to do an Oral History of Mr. Trainer and I’d like to get started if that’s ok with you?  Edward Trainer: Sounds good to me.  JP: First of all, could you please tell me when and where were you born?  ET: Well, I was born on July 6th, 1924 in Panama City, Florida. My family lived in a small two room house near the beach, and from what I remember my mother telling me is that I was born right there in that house.  JP: And how many years did you live there?  ET: I believe that we lived there for fifteen years, or at least until I dropped out of high school to get a job to help with our monthly bills. Then we moved to across town to a larger house that had a pond in the front with ducks in it. I am positive that we lived there until I came back from World War II.  JP: How large was your family?  ET: There was my mother and father, until he left. There was me, my older brother James Patrick, and my younger sister Patricia Ann. So together that would make five and that lasted until my father left in ’36.  JP: Why did you feel that keeping your little sister in school was more important than keeping yourself in school?  JP: I don’t mean to digress, but do you remember playing around the area you grew up in as a child?  ET: Of course I do….. My older brother and younger sister and I used to go to the beach and hunt and swim and do everything normal kids should do. We were always outside because we had such a vast unexplored area around us. I honestly believe that the 3  Edward Trainer  December 3, 2000  outdoors were one of the single most important determinants of my passion to keep the environment the way it is so kids in the future can observe it the way I did.  JP: Were there many public parks and open spaces to play in around you?  ET: There were not many public parks that we went to. The only one I can recall was about two miles from my house and it was dedicated to the veterans of the Spanish-American War in the late 1890’s. We only went there because it had a crystal clear lake [where] we would hunt turtles in. In terms of open spaces, I wish you could see the land we had all around us. There was not a house within 1000 feet of us and even then, we were separated by woods. There would be days that would go by where we would not come home because we were out hunting and camping out and just being kids. But, when you look at it here in Miami, it is very disappointing, the public parks are no less than pathetic, but I guess you need to go somewhere and that’s all we’ve got.  JP: Did you like the fact that Panama was a small town at the time?  ET: I love the fact that it was a small town. Everyone knew everyone, and that was the way that it should be. However, we all know that we cannot control growth and things happen that are out of your control. South Miami used to be a small town and that was something that I liked about it. Now it is still somewhat small when you compare it to the surrounding areas. But, Panama City changed after the war and it could never go back to being a small backwoods town again.  JP: Did you know that you wanted to make Miami your home when you first arrived here?  ET: No I didn’t. It wasn’t until I met my first wife, Jane, did I realize that I wanted to live here.  JP: As we have talked before, I am aware that it was around this time that you really started to feel your views about the environment and decided to do something about it. 4  Edward Trainer  December 3, 2000  ET: Yes, well, what had happened was that I returned to Panama City because my mother and her husband were killed in a car accident. They had willed me their home there and all of their possessions. Still no one had heard from my brother at this time and my sister would have rather died than come back to Panama City. I was the only one who kept up contact with my mother and she rewarded my love with their estate. When I took my family to Panama City for the funeral, I was disgusted with the development that had taken place since I left and I decided to do something about it. I went to the next City Hall meeting and voiced my opinion about the development of the open spaces. They did not like what I had to say, they threw me out of the meeting and I thought that was it. While I was walking to my car, a mob of people that were sitting in the meeting rushed up to me and congratulated me on the voicing of my opinion. We all went back to my house and decided something needed to be done about this development. That night we formed the Greater Panama Area Conservation Society, which we coined G-PACS, and we set out to save what was left of our undeveloped town.  JP: What exactly did G-PACS do in Panama City?  ET: Well, our main focal point was to preserve what was left of our historical buildings and try to get the city to reserve some spaces for public parks that could be dedicated to the many war heroes and other important people from around our area. It sure was a learning experience for me. I never really knew that city government was as corrupt as it was.  JP: What did you see that disturbed you so much?  ET: Well, I don’t feel like going into it that much because it still gets my blood boiling just to talk about it. But, let’s just say that I did not think that the elected officials were playing with a full deck of cards.  JP: Did you ever consider starting a group here in Miami like the G-PACS?  ET: Yes I did, especially when I tried to find areas for my son to play. To see the look of disappointment on his face when I would tell him about my childhood, I knew that he 5  Edward Trainer  December 3, 2000  would never get to see anything like what I saw as a child. Plus, in Miami, it is just not worth it. There are too many bureaucratic bull-shitters that will hold up your progress for the most absurd reasons. I knew that we could accomplish what we did in Panama because there were those there that cared. I just do not see that down here. When I moved to South Miami, Clyde Taylor was the mayor and that man could not tell the difference between a hole and his you know what. Ever since then, I have focused my energies on Panama because that is an area that will change if the people so deem it necessary. G-PACS has worked wonders in its 30 years or so of existence.  JP: Well, it seems that you have a sour taste in your mouth about South Miami and Miami in general when it comes to the environment. But I would like to spend a little time discussing South Miami, the environment around South Miami and the public parks and open spaces there if that is ok with you?  ET: That would be fine with me; I only have a problem with the people in charge, that’s all.  JP: Now you have lived here, I mean in South Miami, for approximately thirty years, correct?  ET: I guess you could say that, but not so much anymore, I usually travel between here and Panama City every other week or so to take care of business up there.  JP: When you first came in, it was around the time of Clyde Taylor as the mayor of South Miami, correct?  ET: Yes, and let me tell you that I thought that every time I went to a city council meeting, I thought I was going to strangle that moron. While the subsequent mayors have done little to help this city, I wouldn’t doubt the fact that this man actually hurt the city.  JP: How is that?  ET: Well, if I recall correctly, I believe there were a few referendums on the commissioners table at the time to refurbish one of our parks, I’m sorry I can’t recall the 6  Edward Trainer  December 3, 2000  name, and there were arguments that we should preserve some historical buildings too. From what I remember, Taylor ignored these issues. For all I know, these places that should have been preserved were torn down and that park, heck there’s probably some shopping center on it today. See, I don’t care to get involved down here because it is an area that is very discouraging for an environmental conservationist; there is simply too much government stalling and not enough action. Take Bicentennial Park, I doubt that they will ever do anything unless the right bidder comes along with the price the county is seeking.  JP: There are a few environmental clubs down here, have you ever considered getting involved down here in one of those?  ET: Son, I believe that those clubs are good at heart and that they have the correct issues targeted. But I think that their actions are a bunch of hot air. I know that I may sound discouraging, but it’s the truth, they can only do so much. When the government steps in, there’s nothing to do that can stop what they want to do. It’s been that way down here for some time.  JP: Are you saying that it’s a lost cause to try and save the environment, i.e. parks, open spaces and historical buildings and homes, down here?  ET: Now don’t get me wrong, I believe that the government has accomplished some good things here in South Miami. See, you have to keep in mind that we are a young city, we really weren’t incorporated until the fifties. But, good things have been done. I recall that parks were purchased; schools were built where we needed them, a library was built, and we still maintained our small town feeling.  JP: Do you like the fact that South Miami has that small town feel?  ET: Yes, I love it, coming from Panama to here is a change, even when I did it in the fifties, but to keep that feeling that you know your neighbors and the people who live around you is important, it gives a sense of community. 7  Edward Trainer  December 3, 2000  JP: now, are you familiar with Ordinance No. 13-81-1107, which is a comprehensive plan for the city of South Miami?  ET: Well, I believe, correct me if I’m wrong, that that designated the north as office and the south as houses and shops.  JP: That’s right, from your standpoint, with your conservationist background, how did this affect the parks?  ET: When I learned that we were switching from a mixed-use area to designated development areas, I felt that it was going to be a good thing. Inside I believed that the city was trying to conserve some of that small town feel that we were famous for.  JP: Did this turn out to be something that, over the long run, was good for the city?  ET: Well, I believe that it did some good things, but I feel that it hurt our parks here.  JP: How is that?  ET: In this small city, we have about, oh ten parks or so. There’s Fascell on Red, Brewer on 56th, Willis on 61st, Fuchs on 81st, Palmer on 67th which is mostly just baseball fields, Murray on 58th…..Heck, I can’t remember the rest of them right now. But, this plan, I believe took some funding away from our parks that those parks badly needed for refurbishment. I can recall, because I would go to a different park each week to read and relax, that they began to slowly deteriorate not long after the resolution was passed. This got under my skin so I wrote a letter to the mayor at the time; I believe that it was Jack Block. I vented my frustrations to Mr. Block about how it was important to keep up the quality of our parks and the roles that they played in not only our lives, but our children’s as well. All I got in return was a mass-produced government letter thanking me for the insight as to what to do with our parks. It was at that point in time that I decided, more or less I was frustrated enough to give up on South Miami.  JP: Had you ever been active in government issues that dealt with parks and open spaces here in South Miami? 8  Edward Trainer  December 3, 2000  ET: Yes, I attended many city council meetings, but I did not voice my opinion, and I guess that that was my fault for not doing so. But, I observed others that spoke and I watched how the councilmen brushed off other people’s comments like they were nothing important. This amazed me because these people were supposed to be like us. I mean, we did elect them from among us to serve us, but when they get to that upper level position, they seem to just ignore the pleas for action. I will say this though: I think that it is good that Julio Robaina is our mayor. It is about time that we got someone into office that represents the many other races that incorporate South Miami. From what our city council had looked like for the past half century, you would have never known that Blacks or Hispanics live in South Miami.  JP: How will Robaina change the deteriorating conditions that you have seen in the parks?  ET: It’s hard to say. I have had good feelings about past mayors and have been proven wrong by their actions. However, Robaina is a working class guy, and he knows that the people who elected him will not do so again if he does not represent them properly. So far, he has done a good job of this, but there is still time left to do better. As far as parks are concerned, I have not witnessed much change, but that is different from the past. Now the parks are not getting any worse, they are just staying the same. I have noticed though, that many of the Blacks and Hispanics like to use the parks around South Miami. It seems to me that they enjoy family get-togethers there and it seems to be a main focal point of their weekend activities. Now with the population of South Miami which I believe is now a majority minority, why aren’t these people complaining about the conditions at the parks. When I used to attend the council meetings, it was amazing, there were only a handful of minorities in the audience and rarely did they speak up. If they would rally around this issue, perhaps we would see some change.  JP: Did you ever consider that maybe they need a leader to organize this feeling into a group effort? 9  Edward Trainer  December 3, 2000  ET: Well, if you are implying that I could lead them, then stop right there. I would have no problem doing so if I were twenty or thirty years younger, but I don’t have the energy to do something like that now. Remember, I still act as a consultant to G-PACS in Panama City and that takes up the majority of my time. However, there are problems that exist in each park that can be solved by a group effort.  JP: What types of problems are you talking about? I mean, if I were to name out a park, could you tell me what the specific problem with that park is?  ET: No I don’t think I could with all of them, but with a few that I had mentioned, I could give it a try.  JP: Alright, say for instance, Dante Fascell Park, what is troubling it?  ET: As I recall, the city got that park through the church here. First, the playground there has dangerous equipment because most of it is rusting. The pavilions that are there are nothing more than huts. Sometimes people cut the grass there, but most of the time the city ignores it as well as the trash cans that are constantly overflowing with trash.  JP: Can you give a historical background on Fascell Park, I mean?  ET: Sure, well, this park was not always called Fascell Park. I believe it was named Red Road Park before they changed it to honor Congressman Fascell. It has always been one of my favorite parks because of its proximity to my house. More so than that, it just has the proper park feel than many other parks do not possess. It just seems that some areas are destined to become parks because of their beauty. Fascell Park is just one of these areas.  JP: What about Palmer Park?  ET: Now this is the park that has the most promise. It is just a few simple renovations away from being a quality area. I believe that if this park is taken care of first, it will serve as an example for other parks here. But now, the city does not keep it clean with the trash. Many times I have been there and been interrupted by a homeless person begging 10  Edward Trainer  December 3, 2000  for money. When I go to a park, I do not want to see homeless people. I have nothing against them, but that is my relaxation time and I wish they would just leave me alone.  Aside from those issues, I believe that the park is in pretty good shape.  JP: Can you give a historical perspective on Palmer Park?  ET: I do not remember too much about this park, I just really started going here in the last decade. But like I said, it really is an example for parks that South Miami should use for its other parks. I remember that they really started some developments with this park back when I first started going there which was about ten years ago. The baseball fields were done over some time ago and the football fields were added about the time I went there. What I’ve seen with this area is that the African-American community prefers this park to others in the area. I can’t give a great historical perspective on this community since I’ve only been going there for only a decade.  JP: So, generally, these parks suffer from not being kept tidy?  ET: Yes, but that is the case with all parks in Dade County. The parks that do not bring in money for the city are ignored and the ones that do are taken care of. I believe that the majority of the parks that are not kept up have more potential to be beautiful than those that are kept up.  JP: Was this a problem that existed two, three decades ago?  ET: I remember that when I used to bring my son to play at the parks, there was a problem with litter that is something that no matter how much complaining is done, it will never change. But I never remembered seeing the amount of neglect to the building structures and playground areas that exists today. That does not just cover one park, rather, it covers all parks in this area. When I make my trips home to Panama, I believe that they have a good system of upkeep for the parks and historical sites there. The city is very active in the upkeep of their parks. But what I see up there is that there is more public use of the park systems there. It is really difficult to compare to downs here in 11  Edward Trainer  December 3, 2000  Miami because there are simply more people here. But the bottom line is that the parks that pay off for the city are the parks that are taken care of.  JP: How do these parks bring in money for the city?  ET: Parking and parking alone. Look at Key Biscayne and you will see exactly what I am talking about. I went to walk my dog there a month ago and I ended up spending five dollars to park my car. Now imagine this place on the weekends and you can see what I mean.  JP: What needs to be done to fix the problems that we are seeing in South Miami with the parks?  ET: Well, I believe that if a panel discussion were held between the commissioners and concerned citizens, many helpful solutions will [would] surface. However, whether these solutions will be put into play is another question that only the commissioners can answer. I would like to help, but I know that it would become too frustrating for me to do so.  JP: Have there ever been any attempts that you can remember to fix the conditions that exist in the parks around South Miami?  ET: Not that I can recall off the top of my head. But I know that my feelings about the conditions with the parks here [are] shared by many of my neighbors and friends. I have had many conversations with many people about this issue. But no, I have not seen any effective groups that have been successful in their objectives.  JP: Are there any applicable solutions to the problems in Miami that you have witnessed in Panama City?  ET: Well, we’re talking about two completely different areas that I don’t think the same solutions would work in. But what we did in Panama to really combat the problem of litter und upkeep was to agree that all members of G-PACS would volunteer to take one park in the Panama area and [the] leader of the park would go out and find a group of 12  Edward Trainer  December 3, 2000  volunteers that would help keep up that park. This worked very well and for some time I was interested in doing something like that down here, but I never found the time to take care of that down here.  JP: What time frame are we talking about here with the G-PACS volunteer group?  ET: Oh, I would say that this would have been around 1990 or 91 or so, but no later.  JP: Well, we’re getting towards the end of the interview, I do know you said earlier that you needed to cut this a little short, but I am interested to hear [in hearing] any of your final comments on what we have talked about.  ET: I believe that not too many people respect what we have here. South Miami is a quaint little town that needs to stay that way. MY feelings on the government down here are not as sour as they used to be, I believe that Julio Rabaino will lead South Miami in the right direction. Hopefully, someone younger will step up and take the initiative to see what I have seen and realize the beauty potential in public parks, especially down here.  JP: Well, thank you for your time Mr. Trainer  ET: It was my pleasure.

Today I will be interviewing Mrs. Doretha Nichson. My name is Ameenah Shakir. I am a University of Miami graduate student. The first question I would like to ask you is what does community mean to you?  Doretha Nichson: When I think of community I generally think of unity; that is, people who have a common interest in the neighborhoods where they live and a common commitment to being a part of that neighborhood. So it is not just geographic things, it is kind of an experience, a shared experience.  A.S.: Where and when were you born?  D.N.: I was born here in Miami in Overtown in 1933, so I am now sixty-seven.  A.S.: Were you raised in Overtown?  D.N.: Yes, my father and grandfather both had businesses in Overtown ( ) and I guess when I was around twelve or so, our house caught on fire. So we had to relocate and we relocated to the projects on 62nd street and 12th avenue.  A.S.: What type of businesses did your father and grandfather have?  D.N.: My father had a jitney, [a] line of jitneys, and my grandfather ran a small store.  A.S.: And for those who don’t know, what exactly is a jitney?  D.N.: Well, jitneys then were not like they are today. They are kind of vans today. When my father had his jitneys it was more a seven passenger car or like a station wagon today, and so it took people - primarily blacks - that live in Overtown but worked over on the beach or downtown where it was an intercity transportation system.  Doretha Nichson  November 30, 2000  3  A.S.: Did your mother work as well?  D.N.: My mother worked in the store and at one point she also had a restaurant in the Grove. So traditionally our family has been self-employed in various ventures most of my life.  A.S.: I know you mentioned that you went to Dunbar Elementary School, but what other schools did you attend?  D.N.: I went to Dunbar, then Booker T. Washington, in Overtown where I graduated; it’s not there anymore. I only went to those two schools. I didn’t move around a lot; we were very stable.  A.S.: You mentioned that you lived in Overtown, in your early life, and I was just wondering if you could give me some of your early memories of Overtown, in relation to the way it is now and the way Miami has grown.  D.N.: Well, the most vivid thing I remember about Overtown now is the fact that the house where I was born and lived, and my grandfather’s store was in that neighborhood, is all- and the church that I went to- were all torn down. We were victims of urban removal and in order to put in I-95 expressway, they took those two streets. So, that memory has to be a personal memory because there is nothing to go back and look at. But I remember my childhood as being very warm, loving, positive experience; our neighborhood was like an extended family. I went to school within walking distance, within two blocks of my house, I went to church, within one block of my house, and my father’s and grandfather’s businesses [were] was right down the street from my house and I knew everybody, you know, in the surrounding ten square blocks. So it was, it was something as I look at young people today and don’t see that kind of experience very much. I really miss it because it is a very rich part of my life, my heritage.  A.S.: Do you feel that your parents’ early entrepreneurship encouraged you to become an entrepreneur?  Doretha Nichson  November 30, 2000  4  D.N.: I do believe so; my mother and grandmother and a friend of hers had-- went into business together and had an employment agency where they placed domestic workers, and my mother at one point sold insurance, and I had those same experiences. I had my own employment agency here in Miami and I also was an insurance agent in which I ran my own insurance agency. I don’t believe that I consciously attempted to follow in my mothers’ footsteps. I think that was coincidence because I only thought about it after the fact, but I do believe that that sense of making your own way, making something happen that you’re interested in, creating something, trying to make something out of nothing; I believe that is a part of my background in the experience with my parents and grandparents, and although I have had positions as an employee, I have always gone back and forth from one business venture to another all of my adult life.  A.S.: What was your first experience with racism? I know you mentioned earlier that your father ran a jitney service and took people to Miami Beach and your mother had a restaurant in the Grove; what were some of your early experiences with racism?  D.N.: During that period of my life, I didn’t even know the word racism because I lived in a segregated community that was self-sufficient, so I didn’t encounter other people. I went to a segregated school; I didn’t think of it as a segregated school, it was just my school, my neighborhood school. I didn’t have any significant contact or interaction with white people at that time; there weren’t a lot of foreigners in Miami, the way they are now, but I was not aware of the segregation and discrimination and so forth growing up as a child. Certainly [not] in my early years, and so, I don’t feel that I was seriously impacted by it, but I thought I was living the life. I thought it was great, I didn’t have any complaints, until I got to high school, and I think in high school I sort of became more aware of the fact that there were people out there doing things that I couldn’t do and going places I couldn’t go. And so, I… but again didn’t feel negatively impacted. I don’t remember being concerned about it, quite frankly, until I remember, when I graduated from high school, I went to school in Virginia and I do remember when we moved to Liberty City and I had, therefore I had to commute to come to high school in Overtown—Booker T, and of course we passed other schools in order to get to Booker T. Then that’s when it really, I think, impressed me that I couldn’t go to Doretha Nichson  November 30, 2000  5  those schools we were passing. I think Jackson is one that comes to mind at the time; that was a white high school and probably there are other things that I have just put out of mind because they weren’t important to me at the time. But I’m certain [there were] signals and symbols that I was aware of…going downtown to shop for example, we couldn’t try on clothes in Burdines, and that kind of thing, but I am not much of a shopper. So I’d stay home while my mom did the shopping. I remember stories that my parents would tell but I didn’t personally experience, about my dad having encounters with who[m]ever and close calls. We had family and property in Georgia; during the summer we used to drive back and forth and they had to make special arrangements as to where to stop to go to the bathroom and we would take our food with us because we couldn’t stop on the road. And I would hear stories about sheriffs and law enforcement officers in Georgia giving him a hard time because he had a big new car and that kind of thing. Now they would call it racial profiling or driving while black, but back then you were running the risk of getting lynched and my mother and grandmother were always, when they were talking about it, they were being anxious about his safety. That was one of the reasons he allegedly, that he worked for himself, because he didn’t take a lot of, he wasn’t tolerant of people not respecting him. And one story that I heard was that at one time he was a chef on a ship at sea and the reason they sent him away was because they didn’t want him to get killed because he was having some dispute with white folks and so forth; they figured it was better for him to get out of town.  A.S.: You mentioned earlier that Overtown was a self-sufficient African-American community; how did that compare to moving to Liberty City?  D.N.: As I remember it, when we moved to Liberty City that sense of self-sufficiency moved with it; there became more and more black owned businesses because the population was there to support those businesses. And it was a black community; it was not mixed. Liberty City has always been pretty much the same as it is now as far as demographics, but the funeral homes, the medical professionals, the legal professionals, the stores, the neighborhood convenience stores, you name it-- your first line of resource to get what you needed was from someone within the community, you know, small sphere, and you only went outside of that to buy large ticket items, as they say, things that a small store wouldn’t Doretha Nichson  November 30, 2000  6  carry. But for the most part, back in those days, there were just numerous black owned businesses of all kinds, so you expected that to be your experience; it wasn’t something that you had to struggle to accomplish.  A.S.: Did your father and grandfather at that time still have their jitney service--well, your father’s jitney service?  D.N.: Yes, my father had his jitney service until he died in ’63. He had a service station, on the corner of 14th street and 3rd avenue of Overtown, and that was also the sight where he stored the jitneys, and he had other drivers, and so he had his own medallion for jitneys. And he wasn’t a driver, there were other people driving for him; so he was, although he did other things from time to time, he was in that business for most of my life and up until he died.  A.S.: Did your mother still have her restaurant in Coconut Grove?  D.N.: No, she was in, she and my grandmother were in a serious auto accident driving down one time, and because they were in the hospital for an extended period, the restaurant closed, so after that they didn’t open it up again. It was after that that she started working with the insurance agency.  A.S.: What type of restaurant was it?  D.N.: It was called B’s Home cooking; there were people who used to come for breakfast, before they go to work. I don’t know what their lunch time traffic would have been like, but I remember that one of the reasons they went so early is so they could have breakfast ready for the people who would come and get breakfast and then go on to work, and I think they had a big Saturday weekend business. I was small, so I don’t remember the details just other than them talking about it, but it apparently was successful business while they were running it. Since it was family-run, the family members, primarily being my mother and my grandmother and my great aunt, but when they weren’t able to do it, there was no one to take care of it, because my dad and grandfather were busy with there own businesses. Doretha Nichson  November 30, 2000  7  A.S.: In Coconut Grove, at that time in the West Grove, there were a lot of Bahamians. I guess those were mainly the people who frequented the restaurant, or did people from South Miami or other African-American communities?  D.N.: I wasn’t aware of South Miami; I don’t know what the black population of South Miami would have been like in those years. This was, this was in the forties, and there were a lot of Bahamians in the neighborhood surrounding Overtown as well. I didn’t know that I was eating the same food, the same things they were eating, using the idiomatic phrases and slang and so forth, but I think it was more the neighborhood. It sounds like the kind of business that people would was not necessarily travel to, but it was near home or near where they worked or when they where going from one place to another, and I suspect that it was largely a close distance.  A.S.: What were some of your early experiences of living in Liberty City?  D.N.: Well, we lived in-- the projects were squared off with an inner courtyard that came with playground equipment, it was really family-oriented, children-oriented, and I remember the people in that particular square. There was a music teacher; I took piano lessons, and of course I knew all of the families. Everybody knew each other and the children played together. It was, I don’t remember, I would think most of my memories were more related to school, than to were I lived, because as I said I went to Booker T and there was just so much going on for me with school, and I was active in different clubs and that kind of thing, of course. I wasn’t dating because I wasn’t allowed to date until I was sixteen. So, church and school really established the context of my early experiences during those years, and I was home just because I wasn’t at church or school, or if there was no one home for whatever reason I would always leave school and go over to my grandparents who still had the store in Overtown. So, I don’t remember any-- anything more than the fact that I thought it was a thriving community. I mean, there was always something going on; there was a community center up at Liberty Square, I think it’s called. And everybody took a lot of pride in maintaining their lawns, and it was required that if you didn’t have a lawn mower, as most people didn’t, you would go up to Liberty Square and borrow one from up there because you Doretha Nichson  November 30, 2000  8  were absolutely required to take care of your yard and keep it looking nice. And this sense that people have about housing projects, the negative image that people have of housing projects, was not something that we were conscious of because they were new and well- maintained and the people living there, it was just like you were living in an apartment, and so I wasn’t aware of that stigma when I was living there; I only became aware of that after we left. When we say people live in the “projects” it’s something like, carries that image like “Good Times” where everybody was kind of down and out which is, I guess, would fit into the description now. But I remember it as being a great place to grow up… I don’t have any memory or experiences that gave me a negative feeling of it; we weren’t there for a long time because they only allowed us in because we had the fire, and I don’t know what the criteria was, but at some point we moved out and moved back into our own home, and we started another store over in Brownsville. And that store, I think he bought it-- that store had housing behind it, and so we were in the residential part and then somebody ran the store, so, for those years that we were there ().  A.S.: So how long did you live in Liberty City?  D.N.: Well, by the time, maybe about six years, because it seems to me when I went to high school, shortly after I went to high school, we moved out there and when I graduated from high school, we were no longer living there, so, without having some confirmation from my mother, I’m not really sure, but that is the way I remember it, that when I graduated from high school we weren’t living in Liberty City, but we were living in…  A.S.: Did you have other siblings?  D.N.: My father married again and had another family so I have half brothers and sisters, but I was in high school by that time so we didn’t grow up together.  A.S.: Was that experience traumatic for you, when your father remarried, or how did you adjust?  Doretha Nichson  November 30, 2000  9  D.N.: I am sure it was, but well, it was, but I don’t remember the specifics of what went through my mind at the time. I was-- I think I was more traumatized by the separation of my parents than I was by the fact that my father subsequently remarried. And when they separated my mother and I moved to Lincoln Terrace on 62nd street, but it was just a year before I graduated from high school and went away to college, so I wasn’t there for very long, and I was, and our family remained close. I was never aware, and I think the reason it was so traumatic was is because I didn’t see it coming, and even after the separation my whole family-- my mother, my father, and my grandparents, and my aunts, and cousins and all the relationships—continued. The extended family stayed tight, even though they were no longer married and living together, and so his remarriage didn’t come-- and I was way in college and so I didn’t deal with that very much.  A.S.: Where did you attend college?  D.N.: Hampton, and at that time it was called Hampton Institute.  A.S.: And what was your major at Hampton?  D.N.: Accounting.  A.S.: Do you feel that you majored in accounting because both of your parents were entrepreneurs?  D.N.: No, I didn’t think about it that much at the time, but when I was in high school, Ms. Shannon, Marion Shannon, was one of my favorite teachers, she was my bookkeeping teacher. She had gone to Hampton--that is why I went to Hampton--and I enjoyed bookkeeping, and I was good at bookkeeping and secretarial, secretarial skills or whatever they called the courses back then, secretarial science, I think they called it. So, I didn’t have any strong career choice like somebody who wants to be a lawyer or doctor. I decided to major in something that I was good at and would enjoy doing and so that is why I picked Doretha Nichson  November 30, 2000  10  accounting, because I knew I would be successful at it and it was something I had an affinity for.  A.S.: How would you compare the community of Hampton Virginia to Overtown or Liberty City?  D.N.: I never saw the community of Hampton, the campus was the community. I think the only time I saw Hampton or Richmond was when I was traveling and went to Richmond to get on the train. So, traveling from the campus to the train station and back, I don’t remember Hampton as a community at all; everything we needed was on campus, and so I was deep into that college experience.  A.S.: So after you left Hampton, did you return to Miami?  D.N.: I didn’t-- I left Hampton when I graduated in 1950, and I didn’t come back here to live until 1970. During the summers, because my mother does not have other family and she and my father were by this time divorced, when I was in my second year in college she moved to New Jersey, so when I was having college vacations, campus vacations, I began to establish a community life in New Jersey where my mom lived, and when I graduated I got a job in New York, so I would come to Miami to visit my father and my grandparents and my family, but I didn’t live here again until 1970.  A.S.: What made you come back in 1970?  D.N.: Well, in the meantime, once I graduated from college and got a job, my mother did not like the winters; she would come down in the winter and come back in the spring. She would come back right after Thanksgiving and would come back after Easter, or something like that, and as she got older, she began to seem not to want to keep coming back and forth and she was trying [to] decide which place did she want to live, but because of the winters she decided she wanted to come back to Miami. I had always been very close to my mother and lived with my mother most of my life, and so after I got to the point where-- first of all, I got Doretha Nichson  November 30, 2000  11  divorced in 1973 and I was thinking about leaving New Jersey and my first choice was California, San Francisco, but my mother didn’t want to go some place where she didn’t know anybody. She said if she moved at all she wanted to come back to Miami, so I said, “Okay, it’s back to Miami we go.” So during one of those times while she was down in the winter, I would come down for a long weekend to start getting the lay of the land to see what was down here for me to do, and I finally got a job offer and I came down.  A.S.: Who were some of your early role models?  D.N.: Mrs. Walton Robinson Young; she was one of my teachers at Dunbar and I think she was some sort of () and Ms. Shannon, of course at Booker T., Ms Harris at church, the ministers and ministers’ wives, () things they would see and talk about and they encouraged me to explore different things but… Actually, my father was one of my role models, too, because I always respected his sense of responsibility for himself. He took care of his family and his parents, and he didn’t give excuses about other people wouldn’t do this for him, other people wouldn’t let him do that; he seemed to find a way to do what he wanted to do and be successful, and that is what I always tried to do. And he was a quiet man; he and I didn’t talk a lot about any of this. These things are things that I have thought about as an adult, but when I was growing up he was just my daddy. I was always taken care of and never had a sense of lack or need, and while I became, as an adult, I became aware of his foibles and weaknesses like all humans have, but it never got in the way of his being responsible. And I think that is something that is important, that is take responsibility for what you do and be willing to look at the consequences and live up to responsibility to others, so in that respect he was also one of my role models.  A.S. You mentioned your neighborhood where you grew up was destroyed, and in recent times they are talking about rebuilding the Scott Projects. I was just wondering, you being a person who had a community that was established and now it is no longer there, how do you feel that will affect people that live in Scott Projects?  Doretha Nichson  November 30, 2000  12  D.N.: Well, I think for anyone who has a strong attachment to their neighborhood and [has] have a strong attachment to the people in their neighborhood, because I saw my neighborhood in Overtown, as I said, as an extended family. I remember who lived where and who did what and that sort of thing. If you have that kind of attachment, then I think it tears at the roots of your sense of self to have that physical structure destroyed. Obviously you get over it, but it does, as you can see, it is the first thing I thought about; because having been away, when I came back in 1970, although I had probably read or heard people talk about the changes, one of the things that I did was get in the car and drive around and see some of the old sights, and that’s when it hit me: I drove up and down trying to find 5th place, which is where I used to live, and the street no longer exists. There was no other street named 5th place; they didn’t name another street that until much later. So here, I can’t find, I saw the school and I saw what came next, and I said, “I know I am not crazy, I know that there is supposed to be something in here between.” I think that, that same thing might happen to young people, too. I think that the older people will adjust more easily; the young people who are growing up there, if they have that sense of attachment, and I don’t know that they have that, then there is going to be a time, especially if they leave for awhile and that’s what they remember when they left. So while you are away you’re thinking of home and you’re thinking of home the way you left it, and so I think that would feel a wrenching. But, beyond that, it may be a blessing because sometimes we don’t move forward because we don’t have to. When something picks us up and puts us down some place else it’s a time to grow, to stretch and discover new horizons, to do a lot of things. So although those things happened as I was growing up and as I was moving, as I look back there were no negative consequences to me or my family that I am aware of; other than the fact, it just seemed unfair. I am not aware of the details, economic details, of what kind of settlement we got out of being, having us vacated, I doubt very seriously that it was anything that approached equity for our home, but that’s history, and we got new property, we had new homes, and went on with our lives rather successfully, I feel, from the point of view of what we were able to do considering the different things that happened, and so that’s all a part of life. Change is a part of life and while it may feel negative when it is happening to us sometimes, or as we look at it sometimes, it’s not necessarily negative, so that is the way I would look at Scott [Projects]. Ten years from now I know I can’t drive over to 62nd avenue and 12th parkway and see the Doretha Nichson  November 30, 2000  13  structure that I used to live in. I know in my mind the same I know in my mind about Overtown, what that was for me, and I assume and really believe that whatever comes after that will be a positive experience for whatever generation comes next, and people who leave it, if they don’t return, move on to something that represents growth for them.  A.S. Do you feel that the people that are being displaced from Scott Projects will be accepted in the other areas they will have them living in while they’re rebuilding?  D.N.: If they want to be I think they will; and not, I would not term it as displacement, because they’re living in housing subsidies. Housing project, I think, is intended to give a person a leg up so that they can move on to be more. () And so, that should happen at some point, anyway, it’s just happening now, not by the person’s choice of timing, but by circumstances. But if all the systems are in place—and I am not suggesting that they are, they almost never are—but if all the systems are in place and the individual has the drive and the confidence, too--because it’s not happening overnight, there is some warning, there is a period of time to get ready for it. If I were that person or that family, I would insist on those systems responding to me in whatever I needed so that I could take the, so I could take and raise the family to this family change, making the best use of it and go on to something that… I am happy that there are programs for people to move into home ownership, which I serve on one of those boards, so I know that there are people in place, people in the Hope VI project in Scott. We ‘re looking at that as a population to serve and move them into home ownership at some point and try the programs. All kinds of things may be possible, but we have to look at it as an opportunity, not, rather than feeling like a victim; and I hesitate to say this because I don’t want people to… I’m not criticizing people; I am simply saying that that is what it takes. When you have reached a wall, then it is to decide—what’s going to give me a leg up to get over the wall, or around it, or look behind and find resources that I didn’t know I had before, and using it or whatever, rather than standing and crying and beating on the wall, that’s just not a way of dealing with problems; to the degree that people can do that, they will be fine.  Doretha Nichson  November 30, 2000  14  A.S.: You mentioned that you work on a committee that is interested in helping or is helping people to find homeownership. What are some practical ways that you are doing that on the committee?  D.N.: Well, the Neighborhood Housing Services; I am member of the board of directors and we are, our revitalization area is the North Central Dade Area. So, the staff there [has] have loan programs and home education buyer programs and we have systems in place to help people know what’s available, see how they qualify, and take advantage of it. I used to be the chair of that board of directors; I am not now, but our, the resident’s role has always been to help publicize the program, make sure that people get the services that are available, and to attract other resources that are needed for increasing homeownership or giving aid to revitalization projects on the way. And that was what attracted me to that organization and what I tried to keep the focus on, and not to lose sight of the fact that a lot of these government programs—(speaker breaks off because a pager is sounding) would not… so I was just talking about the work of the neighborhood housing centers, and that was primarily the focus from my perspective, was making sure that people knew about this effort. And the second thing we did quite a lot of, we do quite a lot of, is creating and organizing home owner associations and block-clubs and things of that kind so that the residents of an area get involved in planning and maintaining the standards of the neighborhood; that is probably the most challenging.  A.S.: Why would you say it is so challenging?  D.N.: Well, the revitalization area of the neighborhood area that we are looking at is primarily unincorporated Miami Dade, and it’s hard to get people to take responsibility for an area when they feel they don’t have any power or leverage with government. Because so much of what it takes to keep a neighborhood attractive and keep up the standards relates to what municipal government services, and unincorporated Dade in this area, it’s been a continual passing, so people lose, they either lose interest because it takes too much time and effort and they don’t see the results that they think they should get, or they don’t care to start with. They don’t feel a sense of responsibility; it’s somebody else’s responsibility to keep the Doretha Nichson  November 30, 2000  15  yards clean because they are tenants, not homeowners. And there has been a lot of turnover in this particular area of homeownership, so it’s just, you don’t have an amount of people that have been living here for a long time you don’t see progress, or they don’t feel an investment in community. People have so, especially young families, have so many demands on their time and energy, they don’t want to go to homeowners’ meetings and PTA meetings, and so it has just been a constant challenge to keep the neighborhoods fulfilling that responsibility, not just as a homeowner but as a resident, because no matter who owns the house it is your yard, so that, we do have special efforts to do that for them.  A.S.: So is your organization responsible for the upkeep of these people’s yards or is it like when you lived in Liberty City, you were required to keep your yard clean?  D.N.: You know that was one of the conditions of living there—somebody from Liberty Square project staff, maintenance staff, would drive around and see that the yard wasn’t cut and if the grass wasn’t cut, then I don’t know if you got a fine or whatever, but people paid attention to it so there must have been some consequence, and you couldn’t have an excuse, that well, I don’t have a lawnmower, because you could, you could borrow one from down in the main office. But also people loved to have beautiful yards, shrubbery and flowers, and because the places all looked alike, one of the ways you personalize was by what you did, what you did with your yard, and I have noticed that there are some people now who do that same thing. As I drive around I see there are some yards that have just beautiful shrubbery and flowers and plants and so forth and somebody is obviously taking taken care of them, and then there others where the grass is cut, and that’s all, the grass is cut, but that is typical; even if you are living in a regular neighborhood, you know, you are going see people having different ways of maintaining their property, and, but it is always the responsibility of the person who lives there. Where we get involved is where there are vacant lots; it’s always a problem keeping them clear because most of them are owned by people who don’t live here and you have to find them, you…but no, we don’t take responsibility for maintaining, but what we try to do is--peer pressure is always helpful. So if you have a neighborhood association and they meet and they talk about standards and they talk about the people who don’t live up to them, then you are more likely to get a sense of responsibility out of that than Doretha Nichson  November 30, 2000  16  if the neighbors argue and you talk to them. And so having a neighborhood organization is a real plus, then, making sure if there, if there are resources that are needed or from other places, then we try to place groups into those resources, and that’s what it’s all about.  A.S.: So how successful have you been in achieving homeownership for people that live in the projects?  D.N.: Well, rather successful. We have, I believe, in the last executive directors’ report, I think they maybe did over fifty this year, plus another number of people who are in the pipeline; meaning that they have been thinking of this as an option, they have taken this class, but they have to do some other things before they can qualify, like get their credit cleaned up so that they…but over the years, this is an organization that is twenty- two years old, so over the years, I’m sure that there are a lot of people who have benefited from this program. There are even areas of West Little River that this organization has placed, been responsible for building new housing, as well as helping people get loans for buying housing, so I think that it’s made a significant impact upon homeownership in this area and in some of the neighborhoods in the southwest as well.  A.S.: What partnerships do you have with banks or with other companies that help you to provide this homeownership?  D.N.: The structure of the NHS is a partnership between financial institutions and the residents of the revitalization area and government. We have representatives from all those groups on the board so, and so, they, the reason they are there is that it takes that combination of resources to make it happen. If it were just a resident group than we would have to keep trying to get cooperation and support from the financial institutions and governments; by setting the organization up, and it’s a national network, it makes it real easy by setting the organization with that collaborative structure. It’s built into the process, so we have banking partners that are prepared to be a part of the deal, where this combination of some subsidies, some private money, some of the residents’ down payments, when the loan officers put the whole package together they’re able to, especially with the special interest rates that we get, Doretha Nichson  November 30, 2000  17  the government subsidy tax credit… I don’t understand all of the legalities of it, but when they get through putting the bid together that’s what makes it affordable. The term that they use now is affordable housing, that’s what makes it affordable, because otherwise this person, if they just went into the bank on their own, than they don’t need it, if they can go into the bank on their own and buy the house, they don’t need a program like this. It is for the people [for whom] who there is a gap between how far they can go financially and what the financial requirements of the financial institutions [are] is, and this program helps close that gap, and also the training to the prospective homeowner helps them not only to acquire the house, but to be more successful in managing their finances so they can keep it, and also maintain managing the property. I think it is a very positive program.  A.S.: Did the fact that you always lived in your own home, was that one of the motivating factors for you to be involved in this program?  D.N.: Actually, I was, I came into awareness of this program and started working with it in a collaborative effort when I was working at the community college for a community organization, and because the neighborhood organization was one of the things NHS does, and serving the same community that I was trying to work in. We had a collaboration between the college, the church that had an outreach program, and NHS, because we were trying to do some general community improvement, an improvement moving toward incorporation, so that is how I first came in contact with it, and subsequently, we had a grant for outreach specifically geared toward forming more homeowners’ associations, neighborhood block clubs, various kinds of organizations, so that was my primary interest. The fact that they were into homeownership was kind of secondary and it just kind of factored together.  A.S.: What other community activities do you participate in?  D.N.: Well, I’m involved in a senior citizens’ ministries and we have a weekly fellowship program that is here on Wednesdays, and also we take meals to … we are building a larger program shortly; we will be moving down to Arcola Park so that I can’t expand it here. Doretha Nichson  November 30, 2000  18  “END OF SIDE A”  “START OF TAPE 1, SIDE B”  A.S.: We were talking about your community activities; what do you feel encouraged you to become so active in the community?  D.N.: Well, community service has always been a part of my approach to life generally, so when I get involved in church or my neighborhood that generally leads me to looking for an area of service so [cough]… that’s why I get involved in community activities, to find a place to make a contribution to making things better for us, all of us, and it generally works off of something that I am already involved in like this business, because my mother is an elderly person, I am an elderly person for that matter, but because I am involved with older people I become aware of their needs and things that I think could be done better and so that leads me to getting involved in activities.  A.S.: Do you feel that parks and other forms of recreation are important in community?  D.N.: Definitely parks are places where people can connect, and I think that when people connect they begin to care about their common interest more, and so a park, a neighborhood park, is a place where children and adults can find common interest and common activities and get to know each other, so I think having neighborhood parks is very important to any community. You tend now more to see in this area more development of regional parks which brings people from all over into that park. It doesn’t accomplish the same thing, I think, that the community park is, what in the old days in the forties, maybe the corner drug store or the local movie house used to be someplace safe where young people can hang out and do the things that young people do as a part of there childhood and adolescent experience.  A.S.: How do you feel the tearing down of Scott’s Projects will affect people that live there?  Doretha Nichson  November 30, 2000  19  D.N.: Generally I think the people who live there will see it as a, many of them will see it, as being negative because it will be disruptive to their lives, but I am hoping that they will be helped to see that it can be positive and that it could be a change that will take them some place that they want to go in life, such as owning their home or moving to different neighborhoods or whatever can happen. I think it is important to the people who are working in that process to make sure that resources and the information and motivational experiences and so forth are available so that people can find a way to make it a positive experience. I think it will be good for the people who move back into that location and for the ones who have to move somewhere else; I don’t think they will have less of a positive experience but just a different experience.  A.S.: You mentioned earlier that you worked in a job in New York after you graduated from Hampton University, at that time Hampton Institute, and later went on to work with the model city program. Can you give me a little more information on that?  D.N.: Right when I moved back to Miami,1970, my first job, the job that I got that allowed me to move back, was with the model city program that was in its first year, I believe, and that was the first time that I began to be involved in community organization. It was a good way to come back to Miami because it required me to get informed real quick about what was going on, and I had been away for twenty years and I saw it as a way of, positive way of, community development in that it looked at all of the aspects of municipal activities, physical environment, housing, economic development, parks and recreation, health and social services; all of those aspects that make for a positive community development, and approached them from a comprehensive planning point of view and simultaneously. Various programs in the past dealt with one or the other, at one time or the other, and therefore it was hard to see an end result that we were looking for, so there were some positive things that came out of the model city program, although generally the program project did not result in the proposed end result for a number of reasons, but like anything else if you look for it you can find some good in it. The community got organized to take responsibility for itself and, not that we weren’t, that program required community participation, and we have seen that continue in a number of governmental agencies, so I think that the model city concept, Doretha Nichson  November 30, 2000  20  without necessarily coming from government, would be an idea that the local community should continue to use, and should look at the total community rather than just dealing with one aspect or one target group or one economic group, but look at the community and the people as a whole.  A.S.: How has your work with the north central Dade area been similar to other incorporation efforts in Miami?  D.N.: Well, it’s similar to the, I think it was around 1984, that there was an attempt to incorporate the new city that only came north to 103rd Street, and I said similar because it was a comparable socioeconomic community in the same general part of the county, it, and that didn’t, it failed as an effort, but it laid the ground work, and they started that effort again in 1990 and moved the boundaries to 135th street, so I think that we have more in common with that effort and with the destiny effort than we have with any other of the municipal incorporation efforts in the county, which have otherwise been affluent communities whose obstacles have been primarily getting around metropolitan Dade county, where as in our area we have other kinds of considerations to deal with, such as the tax base and tapping the leadership and finances to mount a campaign to get around Dade county, which destiny was not successful in doing for a number of reasons, but generally I think the incorporation movement county-wide is going to gain momentum, if we could ever get past the, get the front page of the Herald back, that’s been captured now for months and months between the "Elian business" and the "campaign business;" it’s hard to get local governments’ attention on anything else, but I am projecting that next year that is going to be a major issue.  A.S.: What do you feel is the legacy you will leave?  D.N.: Well, I’d like to leave a legacy that affirms that we can do anything, that anything is possible, and we’re not defined or limited by other peoples’ definition of black people or African Americans, and that our ultimate destiny is not in anybody else’s hands and that we will not accept the limitations that may be projected for us by race or income or any other limitation, but that we acknowledge that we do have personal power and cultural power and Doretha Nichson  November 30, 2000  21  that we will know that all things are possible. And to the degree that I can help infuse that consciousness in young people and young adults and act from that consciousness as we deal with government and other institutions; that’s what I would like to blaze a trail for in terms of things that I have gone through.  A.S.: What books have you read that have increased this consciousness?  Pause  D.N.: I like reading Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, Maya Angleou, Oprah, because I think these writers have that consciousness and they build their writings in a way to get that message to their readers. In the group of spiritual authors, I read Eric Butterworth early on; I read an Autobiography of Ayogi that really put me on this path and the Norman Peale Think as Though You Are Rich that was re-authored by Dennis Kimbro with more of a black perspective. I think it is just a powerful book of ideas and strategies so I tend to look for the kind of authors and books that keep me properly motivated along those lines and that I can use to encourage other people to get the message across.  A.S.: How do you feel Miami has changed in terms of diversity; what are your memories of diversity in Miami?  D.N.: My early memories in Miami…the diversity that I was aware of was within the black community, and that there were people who came from Georgia, South Carolina, and places like that, and there were Bahamians and that was it, and that was the diversity, and of course then there were the white people, so that was when what I grew up, but now the diversity in south Florida is just beautiful experience. I can remember times when I walked in areas, say over on Miami Beach, for example, or some other places where there was shopping and heard three or four different languages and I love language and I love traveling, so I am very cultural, world cultural-oriented, and I think that’s beautiful, and to the degree that our young people can realize that, they realize in that kind of environment and capitalize on it, would just be a tremendous experience. Unfortunately, that’s not where the focus is; the diversity Doretha Nichson  November 30, 2000  22  that I hear focused on a lot has to do with having people overcome something negative. I don’t think of it that way, I think of it as being in the middle of something positive and just having to be aware, it… I don’t see anything negative about having a lot of different cultures in the same place because I don’t think that it takes away from any of them; I think that together they make something better.  A.S.: Do you feel that segregation has helped or hindered; integration has helped or hindered African-Americans?  D.N.: Integration has helped because integration, well, desegregation has helped because that is the removal of the legal participation in the unjust act of segregation, and so tearing down the walls of discrimination by removing the legal parts of it, the “civil movement” is very positive, because that is supposed to be the inalienable rights of all Americans to live in a free and just society, and so the first step to do that was to take the legal barriers. Desegregation, I think, has pretty much been accomplished; integration has not. We do not live in an integrated society, racially, culturally or socially or in some part economically; but you can make laws about segregation, we have not effectively legislated integration, and I don’t think we will. And so, the attempt to continue the civil rights movement along the same lines as it was in the sixties, I don’t think can be successful because civil legal obstacles are not our primary obstacles to deal with right now, so I think it is important to make a distinction between integration and desegregation and accept that we are, really, are not in a segregated society; there is no law that keeps black people from doing whatever it is they want to do, and using those same tactics is not going to win us any new battles in my opinion  A.S.: What if any other [Recorder is turned off and then back on].  A.S.: Earlier we discussed your parent’s involvement as entrepreneurs in Overtown and Coconut Grove; do you know what their motivations for coming to Miami were?  D.N.: I think in those days, and we are talking about the earlier thirties because I was born in 33, so late twenties, early thirties, I think, on my father’s side, my grandparents came from a Doretha Nichson  November 30, 2000  23  farming community in Georgia, and I think as I spoke before, my family was just kind of built around the idea of economic independence and self sufficiency and for whatever reason, they saw their future being brighter in a city rather than if they continued in a rural area, and I believe that my grandfather came down to work on the railroad they were building in those days… I am not sure, but I could ask my mother, but I think I remember, and that’s what brought them to Miami. Some of our relatives went to Jacksonville, and so on my mother’s side, the reason she was here, I think her family had lived in that same area in Georgia, the Thomasville area, but she had an aunt who was a teacher at Mays and so when her father died, her mother came to live with us. My aunt was living down here and that [is] how my mother first came to Miami, and my mother and father met in Miami; they didn’t meet in Georgia, although they are both from there. I think, maybe, because they had common interest from coming from the same place and moving to the same church they eventually got married, but that’s how they got to Miami, as far as I know.  A.S.: Why do you feel that black entrepreneurship is lacking in the Liberty City area now?  D.N.: Well, this, I think, is one of the offshoots of integration. Businesses started to fail because the people had the freedom to shop and get services beyond the segregated business community, segregated community… they went elsewhere, that they used to get within the neighborhood, so a number of businesses started to fail and people were less motivated to start new business because the marketplace wasn’t there, as strong. Unfortunately, we didn’t re-invent a new economy and therefore it takes a lot more aggressiveness to start a business in a place like Liberty City. One of the things created by segregation was that you had a mixed economic community; you had blacks who were low-income, blacks who were low and moderate-income, and blacks who were affluent, and so you wouldn’t just have to have businesses that just catered to one economic group. Now Liberty City is for the most part, not totally, but for the most a low-income community, and most of the businesses there tend to cater to low and moderate-income customers, and I think that has been one of the negative things, is that therefore the other people have to go someplace else to find what they need, and the other reason, I think, has been because of the crime that was so rampant, not as Doretha Nichson  November 30, 2000  24  much now, but for a period of time, of businesses were just getting stolen blind, day after day, and you couldn’t make any money. You couldn’t succeed in a business if its customers couldn’t be safe or if they were afraid to come because they thought they couldn’t be safe, and you couldn’t keep your stock on the counters because people were stealing you blind, and those are the things that probably had the most negative effect on black-owned businesses in Liberty City.  A.S.: Do you feel that the fact that you had once lived in Liberty City was one of the reasons you remained active with trying to allow people to get homeownership?  D.N.: Because, no, I don’t think so, I think I was interested in homeownership because I think we live in a kind of society where that is one of the notches on the belt of success and as long as you renting… and also because I think that building assets is a positive way to create an estate, so as long as you’re renting and you are not in a condo, or you’re not renting someplace where you are doing it out of choice, as long as you renting you’re not building that estate, so what do your children have, they also have rent receipts, so it’s called, I think heard someone call it once, real estate, the only real estate is a poor man’s way of creating an estate for future generations and their family, so you get a home that is worth 45,000 dollars and your children get one that is worth 100,000 dollars because of, they have that equity to build on, and some of those ideas, I think, are why… and also people tend to take better care of their property when they own it, they have more of a vested interest and in looking at community improvement, we could see that a lot of the problems had to do with people with transient tenants, and people waiting for the landlord to pickup the trash in front of their apartment building and stuff like that, so I think those are the things that led me to feeling that community improvement goals could best be achieved by improving home ownership.  A.S.: What does the home or house mean to you?  D.N.: A house is a physical structure; a home is an environment, an emotional and social environment, related to who is in the structure. That is the distinction that I make.  Doretha Nichson  November 30, 2000  25  A.S.: Thank you, you have been very informative.  D.N.: My pleasure.  “END OF INTERVIEW”	Text	IPH-0051			application/pdf		IPH-0051_DorethaNichson.pdf		2010-08-23	2010-08-23	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/oralhistory/id/35	35	36.pdf	/oralhistory/image/36.pdf
Interview with Doretha Nichson			Nichson, Doretha	Shakir, Ameenah		Shakir, Ameenah; Prospoer, Jessica	2000-11-30	Miami, Florida	The African American family has traditionally valued the constant interaction of  community. Whether it is professional or social, this sense of community  eventually began to disappear once African Americans began to disperse into  different neighborhoods. In many ways, this phenomenon is related to the larger  development in the United States, where the traditional neighborhood began to  break down as people became less interactive. In examining the present day conditions of the housing projects in Liberty City,  it is hard for one to imagine that these were once considered desirable housing.  The conditions of modern day Liberty City have depreciated to the point that  they must now be destroyed. This destruction will cause the removal of nearly  all of its residents. There have been different reactions to this plan. Some of the residents feel it  will give them a better living facility, whereas others feel that the newly  constructed houses will be too expensive. What are interesting about this  development are the different notions of home. For some a home is a place that  has all of the modern conveniences. For others home is a place where things are  familiar. One must not also forget the role that memory plays in the  conceptualizing of home. Many of the residents that will be relocated by the  destruction of Scott and Carver Homes recall the destruction of Overtown by  I-95. Consequently, there are negative memories associated with moving.  However, the purpose of public housing should be to provide temporary housing.  One reason this has failed is that under the Model City program of the 1970’s  the proposed idea of including the entire community in its own development was  not successful. This lack of economic opportunity created a community that was  not self-sufficient. Even still there were some organizations, which aided in  finding housing for low-income people. One organization in particular is the  Neighborhood Housing Services organization. This organization is in the process  of helping residents of Scott Projects in gaining home ownership. The subject  interviewed, Mrs. Doretha Nichson has worked diligently with this effort.   This interview tries to give an overview of different issues relating to housing  in Liberty City. Mrs. Nichson has lived in different areas of Liberty City and  North Central Dade County most of her life. However, her main goal is to help  others achieve home ownership. This interview also gives some insight into why  home ownership is an important step to empowerment. Another issue that is  discussed is access to public space.   Overall, the interview was fascinating because she is a native of Miami and has  chosen to make her life’s work service to others. She has not forgotten that  community is the idea of interaction of all social classes, working toward a  common goal. She is currently exhibiting this by owning and operating an  assisted living facility.

I’m Cécile Houry and I’m doing an oral history of Mrs. Betty Gibson. And we are at her house 5780 SW 60th Avenue, South Miami.  So, to start with, can you tell me where and when you were born?  Betty Gibson: I was born in Fort Valley, Georgia.  CH: And the year please.  BG: The year? I’m not gonna tell you the year. [Laughing]  CH: You don’t want?  BG: I was born on October the 2nd.  CH: [laughing] Can you describe [to] me your parents, like their names, where they came from, their jobs?  BG: My father, I don’t know. He died when I was a baby. My mom was a very unusual person. She went to Fort Valley for me to be born. I had two brothers: one was fourteen years older than me, the other one was fifteen years older than I was. But my mom wanted all of her kids born in the same place. So she left West Palm Beach, where she was living, and went to Fort Valley for me to be born. She stayed there six weeks, she left Fort Valley, went back to West Palm Beach, stayed at West Palm Beach maybe a year, she left there and went to New Jersey.  CH: So that’s where you were raised?  BG: No. My mom worked at a Jewish resort in New Jersey, but we lived in the Bronx, New York. And I stayed there until I came to Miami. My mom died when I was in sixth grade and I spent a year with my brother’s wife and their little girl, and then they shipped me to Miami to my mother’s brother and his wife and my mom’s sister.  CH: I see. What was your mum’s religion and what was yours and how was religion important in your life? Betty Shannon Gibson 3  November 24th, 2000  BG: My mom was a Baptist in New York. I was going to school to become a Catholic. And I went through that until I came to Miami. And when I came to Miami, the people who were going to rear me, they were Baptist. They belonged to the Mount Zion Baptist Church on 3rd Avenue and 9th Street, and I still belong to that church today. Religion has always been important in my life because it was as though God was there to be the director, along with the teachings that I received from the school and from my parents…because I refer to them as my mom and my dad. But I didn’t call them mom and dad, I called them by their names, aunt this and aunt that. But whenever I talked with people, I would say my mom or my dad.  CH: What are your most vivid memories of your childhood in the Bronx?  BG: Being the youngest child on our street, being the girl on my street, and running away with the other kids. And one day, we rented bicycles, and I was nine years old, and we rode the bicycles to Palisades Park in New Jersey. We went across George Washington Bridge. We went from the Bronx to New Jersey and back. Yes! [Laughing]  CH: Was there any individual, place, or event that [was] were important in the neighborhood at that time? As you [remember] remind?  BG: Here in Miami?  CH: No, in the Bronx when you were living there as a kid.  BG: Well, it’s interesting because as a child, I’ve always been a loner. And, I would go with kids but I was always the youngest. And there wasn’t a theater in our area, but there was the movie. And I would go to the movie like, every other day, and I was alone, and I don’t guess that I was bad in that sense, but I would go to the kids’ movie after school, go to the bathroom, stand up on the toilet, until the kids’ movie was over, and then I could see the adult movie because they didn’t come back and double check to see whether all the kids were out of the movie. And my first time seeing a baseball game was in New York, because if you were in a certain class of education in school, in New York they had classes one-through and if you were in that one class, it told to anyone that you had extraordinarily ability to do things. And that class got to do more things than other classes did. And we went to the new things, we would go downtown, to New York library Betty Shannon Gibson 4  November 24th, 2000  and games and things like that, and I just happened to be in one of those one classes. How? I don’t know, but I enjoyed it.  CH: Let’s talk about your education. So which schools did you [go] went to and what were you studying?  BG: You mean after high school?  CH: Yes.  BG: After high school, I wanted to go to school in Georgia, to Spellman University, but I didn’t get the scholarship. There was a hang there. The scholarship was supposed to be for me and they gave it to someone else. So, I decided to go to the service, but no one would sign up for me to go into the army. So, then my mom and dad said, “We are not going to send you to the army, you’re going to college.” I said, “Where am I going?” They said “You go to Fort Valley State.” I said, “I’m not going to Fort Valley State.” If I had gone to Fort Valley State, I had to live in my home because my uncle lived right next door to college and they said, “Why spend all this money?” So I said, “Well, I don’t have any place to go.” My mom said, “There is a school in Tallahassee and you’re going.” And I went to Florida A&M [pause] and I got my BS degree from there, and I was one of Who’s Who Among American Colleges and Universities for 1959 and when I came out, I came to Miami and I got a job. And I said, “Oh well, goodbye University of Chicago.” I had applied there to go to grad school. Well, some place among there, I’d discovered, “Hey, I’m pregnant, I can’t go to school, I’m gonna work.” So I called my husband and I told him, I said, “Guess what?” He said “What?” I said “We’re going to have a baby.” He said, “What? What are you going to do?” I said, “I’m staying in Miami.” He said “No, you’re coming to Syracuse.” I said “Oh no, I’m not either.” I said, “Because when it comes time for this baby, I’ll be by myself and you’ll be gone.” And that as it turned out, the baby was a week old before he even knew we had her. And after that I went to school government. They were looking for nineteen librarians from the United States to do a study one summer. And I just decided at the top of my head I was going to apply. I said, “I’ll never make it and they are not going to come all the way to Miami.” But I did and I went to school that summer. But my husband was so upset. He said, “You’re leaving the baby. You can’t leave the baby.” I said, “But you know this is what…” He said, “No.” And I told him, “Okay, I will never go to school anymore until this baby goes to college. When she goes to college, I’m going back.” And I did go back. I went to FSU and I went to school there through 1994. Betty Shannon Gibson 5  November 24th, 2000  CH: I’d like to come back on when you moved to Miami. I think it was like, in your eighth grade. And you came from New York, so, what was the difference in terms of segregation between New York and Miami?  BG: I had gone to school in New York and it was completely desegregated. My school was. And when I came to Miami that was my first segregated experience.  CH: How was it for you? Was it hard to understand?  BG: No, it wasn’t hard for me to understand. New York may have been desegregated but segregation was there. And the only thing that was different, there was no place for black kids to go in Miami. Like we could ride bicycles and go places, we could go here and we could go there. That was not open to black kids in Miami. And I was in eighth grade.  CH: In 1954, the Supreme Court ruled segregation illegal in schools. And, how did that happen in South Miami, I mean the desegregation?  BG: There was no desegregation.  CH: You think?  BG: There wasn’t. The schools did not desegregate until 1967.  CH: So they did not apply the rule in South Miami?  BG: Not for education, not in Dade County, not in Florida.  CH: So that did not change, the rule did not change…..?  BG: No, I graduated from Carver Senior High School in Coconut Grove. G.W. Carver, 1955. The University of Miami did not even admit blacks. They couldn’t even go to graduate school here.  CH: What were your first impressions of South Miami when you arrived?  Betty Shannon Gibson 6  November 24th, 2000  BG: “I want to go back to New York.” [Laughing]  CH: Why?  BG: There was nothing here. I was a person that loved to read. And my first thing when I got here was, “Where is the library? I need books.” When I came from New York I brought two suitcases with me, and those suitcases were filled with books that I had gone down to the public library and checked out and brought here because I knew nothing about Miami. So I would read all the time.  CH: When you arrived, were there one or more neighborhoods for black people in South Miami?  BG: In South Miami?  CH: Were [was] there like a particular place where black people would move in?  BG: Sure. Basically it’s still there, but blacks live all over South Miami now. But basically they lived from Red Road, not immediately along Red Road, further around 59th Place to 62nd Avenue, and from US 1, where the railroad track comes, to 64th Avenue and maybe about three streets inward.  CH: How would you describe the conditions of black people who lived in Miami in the 1950s?  BG: In Miami or South Miami?  CH: In South Miami?  BG: In South Miami: hard working people.  CH: And their condition of life, their status in life?  BG: You know, I really don’t know because I’m gonna tell you something: I never knew that I was poor, black, and lived in the ghetto. I didn’t know this until I read ---------- book years later, and they talked about this. Because my family had a car, they owned their home, they had a bank account, we ate every day, and they worked every day but Saturday and Sunday. And I never felt a Betty Shannon Gibson 7  November 24th, 2000  pressure that, “I’m black and I can’t do this, and I’m black and I can’t do here, and I can’t go here and I can’t go there.” Actually I only lived in Miami, in South Miami, from ‘50 to ‘55 and then I went away. I went away to school and I had certain ideas that I adhere to. In college my mom started saving money because she knew I was going to jail because I participated in the marches.  CH: Do you think that in the 1950s, when you arrived, Miami welcomed people, like black people, to arrive or to move in the area?  BG: Did they welcome them?  CH: Was South Miami receptive of people coming in?  BG: South Miami has always been I think a very close community. People who came in, came here because they had relatives. And you could basically say, “These people either came for Fort Valley, Georgia, or Holly Hill, South Carolina.” And that’s how you identify, and most of the people within South Miami, they knew one another.  CH: I see. Was there a neighborhood that was considered better to move in inside South Miami?  BG: South Miami only had one neighborhood [laughing].  CH: That was too small?  BG: You either moved there or you did not move here.  CH: I see. Can you describe for me the black-white relationship in South Miami? How was it?  BG: It was tolerable. It was tolerable.  CH: Yeah? It was not like hardly segregated?  BG: It was segregated but we had a policeman. We had two black policemen, uh, who were very good, so I was told. And people just existed. In my opinion - they existed - and they worked to better what they had and to move up. Because when they started desegregated the areas in South Betty Shannon Gibson 8  November 24th, 2000  Miami, people who had the money to afford, they got better homes and so forth. But they were a lot of those who wouldn’t own one bedroom in South Miami. And interesting thing about it, there probably were about three black families who owned the majority of the property here. Yes, one, Mr. Williamson. That family, they gave the land to JRE Lee School and that entire area down there. They built the church there on 59th Place and they still have multiple interests in South Miami.  CH: In the 1960s, or in the 1950s, when you arrived, [were] was there some black areas that you would go to, like Overtown, Liberty City. Were you going there with your family?  BG: We went to church. When I say I belong to Mount Zion Baptist church, that’s on 3rd Avenue and 9th Street. That’s downtown, the heart of they call Overtown. That church still sits there. 95 made an interruption, because we laughed about it, we said, “Well, we’re shaking hands with the people on 95 as they drive by.” Because when they cut that street in, it cut right into our church yard.  CH: But except for the church, were you going to some stores, or to Bayfront, or to some parks?  BG: There was no Bayfront.  CH: To some parks there?  BG: No, I didn’t go to parks. I went with my family to homes of people they knew, either downtown or in Liberty City, because my mom was in the social club and I used to go with her to their meetings and etc.  CH: In the 1950s, when you arrived, can you describe [to] me the businesses that were in South Miami, and which ones were for blacks? Do you remember? Or one that was particularly important?  BG: [laugh] I know my mother’s sister and her husband owned a little store there on 64th Street, right next to their home. And then, there was another family who owned a store on 59th Place and 64th Street. And then, there was a Chinese or Japanese, one of the two, meat market up there on 64th Street, that was right here in this neighborhood. Now, later Winn Dixie had a store on Red Road Betty Shannon Gibson 9  November 24th, 2000  and I remember that, and we would go, as we said, downtown South Miami to the post office. I remember the post office was down there. The City Hall was down there, the library was there, and the little strip of stores that are basically there now. And then, there was a fruit concentration store and all the schools would come to that concentration store to get juice to sell ���Icees” after school to kids, I remember that.  CH: Was there a particular place for black people where they would meet after the end of the day or during weekends? A popular place?  BG: No. There was a bar up there on that corner. I guess people who went to bars would go probably, but that wasn’t part of my life.  CH: I see. What was the chief form of entertainment in South Miami?  BG: [laugh]  CH: Was there anything, like church picnics or festivals at that time?  BG: I guess the church did that. But see I wasn’t connected to the churches of South Miami.  CH: So you didn’t really go out in South Miami?  BG: No, not really. Catch the bus to go to school in the morning, come home in the afternoon.  CH: Can you describe [to] me the different parks that you had access to in South Miami?  BG: Parks? The only park I know, that is the park that is called Murray Park now. That park was there but it was called Lee Park when I was a child.  CH: And did you use to go there?  BG: No.  CH: Who was going there? Was it more black people or white people? Betty Shannon Gibson 10  November 24th, 2000  BG: No, there were black people, used to go there and play ball and so forth, but I didn’t do that.  CH: Can you tell me who were the important personalities in the 1950s in South Miami?  BG: Black person? Mr. Williamson, Mr. Bowman, Manuel Holmes. Those were the people I knew and I’m sure there were others that I did not know.  CH: And they were doing things for black people?  BG: Yes. Like I said, Mr. Williamson, Marshall Williamson, he owned a lot of land, so did Manuel Holmes and Mr. Bowman. His mother was a very dynamic person, and she worked with the City Hall, and he became, I guess, involved with the City Hall. And Bowman just, they used to call Mr. Bowman “the black mayor of South Miami.”  CH: Really?  BG: Yes.  CH: When you arrived in Miami, the Community Center, which was later named after Sylva Martin, had already been built. How important was this center in South Miami?  BG: What center?  CH: The Community Center.  BG: There was no Community Center in South Miami.  CH: That is now called Sylva Martin Center. It was built in ‘35.  BG: The blacks did not go there.  CH: Oh, you didn’t go.  BG: Blacks did not go there. Here in South Miami? No. Betty Shannon Gibson 11  November 24th, 2000  CH: And did you know Sylva Martin?  BG: No.  CH: You didn’t know her personally, but you heard about her?  BG: Yes.  CH: There was also a Chamber of Commerce at that time. Did that play any important role in South Miami?  BG: The Chamber of Commerce? Not really, not really. And I’m speaking for when I came back here in 1960. Because before that, things that were happening in government, I knew about it and I didn’t know about it, and that did not interest me, because I was a teenager. And like I said, I was a one person, I read a lot, I kept up on the things that were going on, but South Miami was just one small ---------.  CH: I see. The City of South Miami is really close to the University of Miami, which is part of Coral Gables. What impact did the University have on South Miami?  BG: When?  CH: In the 1960s, 50s-60s?  BG: In the 1950s, I know they would loan their track field for meets, track meets. I remember that because the kids would walk from Coconut Grove to the school, and they would give them this day for track meets. And that is about the extent of University of Miami participation. Like I said, they did not accept blacks there. And in the 1960s, teachers went away to grad school for they couldn’t go to the University of Miami. The County paid for them. They went to Indiana, Illinois and so forth, to get masters degree because they couldn’t get them there. And FSU was a state school and they didn’t accept them.  CH: I see. And today, what do you think is the impact of the University on the community of South Miami? Betty Shannon Gibson 12  November 24th, 2000  BG: Oh it’s a tremendous impact because the University is open. They came in with scholarships to get black students because they found out if they participate and get black students, they’re gonna get federal money. That was the basics of what happened in the very beginning. If you had black students, you got more money. And it took a long time for the black universities to wake up and say, “We’re going to let white kids in here, so we can get federal funds.”  CH: I see. In 1960, South Miami Hospital opened. How important was it for the city to have its own hospital?  BG: My baby was born February 23rd, 1960, and I could not give birth to her at South Miami Hospital. South Miami Hospital opened February 1960.  CH: So where did you give birth to her?  BG: Mercy Hospital.  CH: Where did black people go to receive medical care at that time?  BG: Kendall Hospital or there was a black hospital over in Liberty City. So they would go there.  CH: And, were there some black doctors in the area, in South Miami?  BG: No, no black doctors in South Miami. They were downtown at Liberty City.  CH: I know that you moved inside South Miami, I mean you didn’t live in this house all the time. Can you tell me when you moved, and why, and from where?  BG: When did I move in this house? We moved here in August 1974. We moved away from 59th Place where we had lived from 1961 through 1974.  CH: Why did you move?  BG: Why did we move? We wanted to put an addition on our house. We wanted to add a bathroom and we wanted to close in our porch. And the contract wanted $ 15,000 to do that. When we Betty Shannon Gibson 13  November 24th, 2000  purchased the house it was $ 12,000. And my husband said, “No way, are we going to put that much money in this little house, so we’re going to find a house. We have to find it in South Miami,” because he was on the commission, so “You go and look and find a house.” I looked all over South Miami; I did not see a house that I wanted. This was the first house he showed me. We were eating dinner one day and he told me and my daughter, “Hurry up, I want to take you some place.” And he brought us here, he opened that door, and when he did, a million roaches started running all over this house. And I said, “No way, close the door.” And he said, “You’re sure you don’t like it, because you know you won’t hear the park.” I said, “No, I don’t like that house, let’s look.” And we looked, and we looked, and we looked, and we came back to the conclusion, because my daughter had always said that “If we buy another house, could we have a pool?” And he promised her, “If we get another house, we get a pool.” So I told him, “Okay, go on and buy that house.” I said “First of all, get the bank to come.” So the bank came, Security Federal. They came and they told him, “Buy that house, we’ll finance it. Because it’s a deal for what you’re going to pay for that house, buy it.” And we bought it.  CH: I see. Was there a difference between the neighborhood where you lived first and this one or was it the same?  BG: No, it wasn’t the same. There were three other black families on this street and we were like the fourth. The house directly across the street was integrated. [The phone rings] Oh my…., can we stop? [five minute break]  [side B]  CH: In the late 1950s and early 1960s, many Cubans moved in Miami in general, and I’d like to know if they moved in South Miami and then, what was the relationship between the blacks and the Cubans?  BG: I don’t know. I was away from South Miami from 1955 to 1960.  CH: But when you came back, they were still moving in?  BG: I didn’t see any drastic migration of people moving here. No.  CH: Today, there are Cubans living in South Miami? Or Hispanics? Betty Shannon Gibson 14  November 24th, 2000  BG: Cubans in South Miami? That’s something that has been very recent. It hasn’t been a whole lot of Hispanics moving in, I don’t think until maybe the 1980s, that you got large fluxes.  CH: And in that case, what was the relationship when they moved in with the black people?  BG: I did not experience any relationship, because I worked at South Miami Senior from 1971 through 1994. And when we first opened South Miami Senior, we had maybe about 17% Hispanics, that was about that much. And when I left South Miami, the Hispanic population I think was like 79%. Yes.  CH: You know, it is said that black people resented Cuban immigration because they said that Cubans were taking their jobs. Did you hear any sentiments like that?  BG: Of course I heard it, yes! But I didn’t see the tremendous impact here in South Miami. It did not impact South Miami as it did other areas.  CH: Why do you think it did not?  BG: Because there was no place in South Miami, basically, where you were going to work in South Miami. South Miami Hospital was the largest employer in this area, and when they opened, there was an agreement that they would pull people from this area to work in that hospital.  CH: I see.  BG: You know, I have always looked around in South Miami to say, “Where are people working in South Miami?” People live in South Miami-- they call us the bed and breakfast. You live here, but you don’t work here. There are people if they work here and you ask them, “You work in South Miami?” “Yes.” “Where do you work?” “South Miami Hospital.” And of course Larkins came in, and that was another influx. But those who had to go out for the jobs, they felt the impact, especially people who were doing domestic work.  CH: That’s what I thought too. You’ve been speaking a little bit about your job, can you come back on that and tell me where did you, when did you start working and what were you doing exactly? Betty Shannon Gibson 15  November 24th, 2000  BG: I started working in 1960 at George Washington Carver Junior/Senior High School in Coconut Grove. And I graduated from that school in 1955. And I was a media specialist. They changed our name from librarians to media specialists and I was the head media specialist there. There were two other people who worked with me. And I stayed there until 1969 and I went to Ada Merritt Junior High School. That was when forced immigration came about and they mixed up the schools. And they were supposed to move twelve people out of Carver to go into a predominantly white school. And some place along there, someone made a mistake and they had to move thirteen, and I was the thirteenth person, and they assigned me to Ada Merritt. And I hate to say this but, I went to work once a week to keep my contract intact.  CH: Why did you do that?  BG: Because I didn’t like the school.  CH: What about it?  BG: It was an integrated school and there was fighting all the time. But the interesting thing about it, it wasn’t fighting among blacks and whites, it was fighting among Hispanics and whites, because that was basically a Hispanic school. And one morning, I went to school and there were two young men who had been fighting and blood was everywhere, and I said, “I don’t have to take this.” And the way there were handling it, I refused. And then I went to an interview that they were giving the teachers and so forth, and I got up that night and I told them - everyone was talking about Dorsey, which was a predominantly black school and white teachers didn’t want to go there – I told them, “Not only you don’t want to go to Dorsey, you don’t want to go to Ada Merritt.” I said, “You sit there, roaches cross, crawl up your leg, urine comes out the second floor down to the first floor.” And it was the total operation of the school, I did not like it.  CH: And then you moved to South Miami?  BG: No, I didn’t move to South Miami. I applied for a sabbatical, which was to go off and study. I applied for transfer and I wrote a resignation. I did the three. And I called the person who was over that area and I said, “Mr. Norton, this is what I applied. Now, get me out of this school.” And he said, “Where are you going?” And I said, “I have a job.” He said “Where?” I said, “Killian Senior.” He said, “You have what?” I said, “Sure, I could have taken that job three years ago and I turned it Betty Shannon Gibson 16  November 24th, 2000  down because I wanted to stay at Carver.” But I said, “I want to go to Killian this year.” I said, “I talked to the principal, he said ‘Betty, come on,’” I said. But this man, the principal where I was told me I would upset his racial balance. I said “I am going to upset it because I’m not going back to your school.” So I went to Killian. And on my transfer, I put this: “School you want to transfer to: South Miami Senior under construction, Miami Killian, now Southwest.” Those were the only schools that I wanted to go to. And I told him I had a child, and I was not gonna leave my baby standing at a bus stop at seven o’clock in the morning, waiting for a bus to take her to school. So I stayed at Killian, and they had forty-two people to apply to South Miami and they were going to select three of them. And I was one of the three. So I moved out of Killian and I went to South Miami in ‘71.  CH: I see. To what extent did race play a role in getting a job, I mean, you talked a little bit about it, but was that like a barrier for black people still to get a job in schools, for instance?  BG: You know, some people had difficulties. I had no difficulty getting a job, because I came in from A&M in ‘59 and I interned at Northwestern and a lady name is Ida Radcliff. She was a terrific person. She accepted twenty-three interns in her building that year. She sent all of us to schools in Dade County to interview for a job, go to the school board and fill out everything. And I went to Carver for an interview and the principal there told me there was no way he was going to hire me in his school. And I said, “Why?” And he said, “Because you cursed me out your senior year” And I looked at him and I said, “You know something, I did curse you out but I never used curse words.” He said, “I know you did not but the way you can curse somebody out is worse than if you use profanity.” So I told him, I said, “Well, you’re not going to hire me.” His secretary said, “--------- you’re not gonna hire Shannon?” “No, I’m not hiring Shannon.” So I said okay, I said, “I am leaving but I’m gonna tell you something: I’m gonna work in Dade County.” He said, “Yeah, we’ll see.” Well, I was married, nobody knew I was married. So I applied for the job in my married name. And he hired that married person (laughing) because I was the only media specialist applying in Dade County and it was segregated school. So he hired me, and when they had the first meeting and I was siting there when he walked in, and he looked and he saw me, he asked me, he said, “What are you doing here?” I said, “I work here.” He said “No, I don’t have a Betty Shannon here.” I said, “But you got a Betty S. Gibson there.” And he said, “That’s you?” I said, “That is me.”  CH: When you worked in the schools, did you ever experience segregation? Betty Shannon Gibson 17  November 24th, 2000  BG: Yes, we had meetings. All the schools here were segregated except the four, there were four black schools here. And we had meetings and they started off, that the supervisor would meet the black media specialists. And then, all of a sudden, she decided no, she wasn’t going to do that. We started meeting together, and I had two sisters my first year when I came. One was the media specialist from Miami High, the other one was from Palmetto Senior. And any time I had a problem, those were the two people that I was to call.  CH: In the ‘50s, when you arrived, do you think that South Miami was a safe place to live? In terms of crime or?  BG: That did not even enter my mind. No, it didn’t. Nothing-- when I was a teenager, crime was not part of my life.  CH: And what about today, do you think it’s a safe place to live?  BG: In South Miami? I think it’s one of the safest places in Dade County.  CH: Do you recall having heard about any incidents between black people and the police force in South Miami?  BG: [laugh] In South Miami? Oh sure.  CH: There were a lot?  BG: Well, I don’t know about a lot, but I do know there were some, yes.  CH: And what was the kind of incidents happening?  BG: Things where policemen would tell blacks they had done anything, or see something and they didn’t particularly liked it. Then, that black person was apprehended. And there were a lot of bad things. And I knew about that.  CH: And did you hear about black people being mistreated by the police force?  Betty Shannon Gibson 18  November 24th, 2000  BG: Of course.  CH: They were?  BG: Sure they were. They were beaten.  CH: Just for things that they did or things that they didn’t do?  BG: Whether they did it or not. If you got a policeman who had an attitude, then you would go and get hit. And you had to be protective of that.  CH: And what is your opinion about the police service in South Miami today? Do you think that it is efficient and non-discriminatory or not?  BG: Non-discriminatory gives me a question mark. I won’t say yes, but I won’t say no. But they are good and the number of people we have as patrolmen in South Miami is tremendous with that population. That was one thing, when they went into increasing the police department – I know this because my husband told me – the total number per capita working with people, we were above some of the other places.  CH: What is your opinion about the development of South Miami over the years, in terms of growth, of buildings, and of traffic?  BG: The total thing in South Miami?  CH: In general?  BG: We have done more building, I guess, since the hurricane - I’m going back and trying to get a ten-year span here - than ever. And a lot of it is attributed to a lot of things. And I know here in basically the black area, if they’re working with drugs and they find drugs in my house, they kick you out, they keep that house, they tear that house down. And I’ve had some questions about “Why tear the house down? Why not just take it, redo it and sell it.” But I know about two places right around here where they tore the houses down. But it makes space for other houses. And with Betty Shannon Gibson 19  November 24th, 2000  Jimmy Carter’s housing development, we have, they have bided (?) and they have worked on that housing development, and it has been very good.  CH: I see. Some people opposed further development in South Miami, saying that, you know, more buildings or more condominiums would make South Miami overcrowded, would make the traffic horrible. What do you think about that?  BG: I don’t think we need to build anymore unless they’re going to build into something they are tearing down. Because the building that is here…, now and I am a citizen of South Miami and I hate to drive in South Miami now, because of all the parking and the way the streets have been done over. I think it’s tremendous. And I do not like driving in my own city, and I don’t believe that they need to put condos in South Miami. We are a small town, leave a small town.  CH: Speaking of the traffic problem, what do you think also of the public transportation in South Miami?  BG: Public transportation? [laugh] The bus that comes through and the Metrorail?  CH: Because some people have complained that they were bad.  BG: I don’t know. You know, I haven’t been on a bus, I don’t think in twenty some years, except charter buses. I ride Metrorail all the time. I drive my car down to the Metrorail station, I leave it there and I go any place in the city that the Metrorail can take me. And if I have to go to Liberty City to a meeting, I go on the Metrorail, when I get where I’m going, I call someone, “Hey, come get me.” They said “Where are you?” “I’m at 29th Street or I’m here or here.” I just tell them, they come and get me. After the meeting, they take me back, I take the Metrorail, and I pick up my car.  CH: I see. What is your opinion about the parks and about the recreational areas in South Miami? Do you think that there are enough parks and that they are well used or not?  BG: The park area, we have enough, they just need to be developed and maintained and have people to work them, that’s [are] going to work them, and provide the correct assistance to kids. Give the kids things they need, not necessarily what they want, to do to just play and don’t have organized--and they are attempting to do that now. And I am waiting for them to finish Murray Betty Shannon Gibson 20  November 24th, 2000  Park because that is a park that has felt the brunt because it’s basically within the black neighborhood.  CH: So you think this one is not as much maintained as the other ones because it’s in the black…?  BG: Of course they’re not. No, they have not been maintained. Some people will say, “Oh yes, we have this.” No, you have to look at the situation. What is happening now, they have people in there that are working and they are maintaining. The park was not maintained. It was not even given the materials to be maintained. You would go to Dante Fascell Park and you go to Murray Park, and you could see the difference and with the kids that are involved there.  CH: I see. I’d like to know your opinion about the new shopping center, you know, Sunset Place. Do you think it is a good thing for South Miami, I mean in the long term or not?  BG: I’m holding. I’m holding on that, because I think about the Bakery Center and all that money that was torn down. We are talking about millions of dollars that stayed there less than ten years.  CH: Why do you think it failed?  BG: What they used it for…what they used it for, and the stores that were in there. Their prices were horrible. I’m a person who goes into a store and buy if I see something, I have to have it. I don’t ask how much something cost. If I see it’s there, I’m gonna buy it. And I went in the Bakery Center one day when my granddaughter was born. And I was going to buy this dress for her, and when they told me how much the dress was, I said, “Thank you very much,” and I got my purse and I left. I said even I wouldn’t just walk in there and buy something. And it wasn’t maintained, the stores and the things that were there. It did not appeal to people.  CH: The way it looked?  BG: The activities that went on. The best thing, two things, there was a gym and the museum for kids. And the movies, half-way.  CH: Can you talk about the Holsum Bakery that was there before the Bakery Center?  Betty Shannon Gibson 21  November 24th, 2000  BG: Oh, that was just a bakery!  CH: But I heard so much about it.  BG: I loved it because during this time of the year, the area that faced US 1, they always did Christmas scenes, and everything there, and it was like, “This is a holy place,” and so, and it hired people. And they worked there, we could go to their shop and buy bread and so forth. And, uh, there is a section of Holsum bakery I did not like, but I don’t want to talk about it.  CH: Which section?  BG: [Laugh] Their employment of the people.  CH: You don’t want to talk about it?  BG: No, I don’t want to talk about it. [Laughs]  CH: Okay. Why do you think it moved then?  BG: Expansion, money. And they needed to expand. There was no place there for them to expand, and they have done well where they are.  CH: So that was a loss for South Miami when they moved?  BG: South Miami gained a lot of money when they moved. Yes, there would be stores and everything coming in and so forth. And as I said, the bakery is still fine. I have relatives who work for the bakery; that’s why I know things about the bakery I just don’t want to talk about.  CH: Okay, so we won’t talk about… I’d like to talk a little more about your husband and his basketball career. Can you first tell me when you met your husband?  BG: I met my husband in 1955.  CH: And what was he doing at that time? Betty Shannon Gibson 22  November 24th, 2000  BG: On every college campus there is some place where the guys get together and stand and watch the girls go by. At A&M, the corner was by the Administration Hall. And I was going by there one day, going to the cafeteria, and these guys started to swoop (?) at a group of us who were walking by. And I turned around - I was told I did this - I turned around, and I turned up my nose and I crooked my lips, and turned around and kept walking. And I never said “boo” to no one there. My husband was part of that group, and he was the one who told me I did that. And I was a freshman. And I never had [anything] nothing to do with him until my senior year. I worked in the dormitory for four years. And I saw him every week because he would come in to pick up a young lady to go out and so forth. And then my senior year, A&M opened up the last of their women dorms and they selected ninety-seven of us to live in that dorm because there wasn’t a night matron, you were on your own. And we had to go, if you were a counselor that was going to be your house for that year for the freshmen. We had to go to school early, we put that dormitory together. We unpacked all the furniture and everything. And I went to the student union one day and bought some ice-cream and as I was going out of the place, this guy said, “Hey girl, get me some ice-cream.” And I turned around, do my usual thing, and it was him. And I gave him a quarter, I said, “Go buy your own ice-cream.” And I walked back. And when I went back the next day, he was there, and we started talking. That was it!  CH: Were you interested in basketball?  BG: No. Not at all. No.  CH: And was he playing at that time already?  BG: Yes, he was one of the star athletes in the state of Florida.  CH: I see. How popular was basketball at that time compared to other sports in general?  BG: How important to me?  CH: No, to people in general?  BG: Oh, they loved it.  Betty Shannon Gibson 23  November 24th, 2000  CH: Compared to other sports, to baseball or football?  BG: Basketball has always been behind football. No one takes basketball over football but the players. [Laugh]  CH: Can you tell me about your husband’s career, like when did he start and who was he playing for?  BG: His career after college? Okay, when we left college - Wilt Chamberlain. What had happened, they had come looking for professional basketball players from A&M. And they were told they didn’t have any, and my husband went to school here. And that summer he went to Philadelphia, and he knew Wilt Chamberlain and Wilt Chamberlain told him, “Go home, pack your bag, and go to Syracuse. Be a walk-on.” And my husband walked on at Syracuse. Syracuse had a team which was the Syracuse Generals. And he worked with them, I think the first month, and at the end they told him they could not sign him, but they would put him on the farm team, which was the Baltimore Bullets, out of Baltimore, Maryland. And he played for them.  CH: And then I think he played for some other teams?  BG: He played with Baltimore and then he was supposed to go back with the Generals. And there was another team and I don’t remember what it was, but it was with the NBA. He was supposed to go with them. And in the meantime, they started the American Basketball Association. And he decided to get smart. You don’t jump leagues, I learned that. And he jumped from the NBA and went to the ABA. And the team he went with was the Chicago Majors and it was owned by Abe Saperstein, who owned the Globetrotters.  CH: So that’s how he met him?  BG: That’s how he met him, and Saperstein started and they played for two years, and the ABA couldn’t hold it, they couldn’t make the stand against the NBA. And then, Saperstein asked the players who played for this team out in Chicago, was there any who would like to try out for the Globetrotters. And my husband did.  Betty Shannon Gibson 24  November 24th, 2000  CH: I see. How were black players welcomed by white professional players at that time, like in the 1950s, 1960s?  BG: I don’t know. I guess they got along fine because when they went there, they played together. They may not have spoken once they got off the court, but they got on that court and they played together.  CH: And, how were they welcomed by the spectators?  BG: Oh, the spectators loved basketball.  CH: So they didn’t care whether it was black people or not?  BG: At that point, they didn’t call them the black seat on the floor, that I had taken place in the 1950s, I know.  CH: Is it true that black players were paid less than white players?  BG: Yes.  CH: Did your husband ever hear about the Globetrotters before he played for them?  BG: You know I have to take you back. Oh dear, my husband had things that he wanted to accomplish in life. And, I don’t know if I’m getting ahead of you or not, my husband did everything in this life he wanted to do, which was very unusual. And he told me, he said, “I’m gonna tell you this now,” he said, “You’re sick and I know how sick you are,” he said, “But I am sure that I am going to die before you.” He said, “I have done everything in life I wanted to do.” He said so, he just as well admitted this and I said, “Leave me alone, don’t tell me about this.” And this started continuously about a year before he died. But when he was growing up, there were things he wanted to do. And he wanted to be a Globetrotter.  CH: What did it mean for him?  Betty Shannon Gibson 25  November 24th, 2000  BG: He said he wanted to be a Globetrotter because he wanted to travel all around the world. And he knew that was one way that he could do that. And in order to do that, he had to get out of high school, go to college, get out of college, and he could get to the Globetrotters. And it was so strange, but when he wrote and told me that he was part of the Globetrotters, and I wrote back and said, “Call me.” And he said, “I’m gonna do it.” And I said “Okay, how many years you’re adding?” He said, “I don’t know, but I got to do this.”  CH: What was it for you to be the life, the wife of a Globetrotter?  BG: I didn’t see him as a Globetrotter. And I tell people this, I saw him as my husband. And all the stuff that he did, and people used to tell me things, and I would stand there and look at them, because I didn’t see him as a Globetrotter, as this or that, I saw him as the guy that I loved.  CH: How did he deal with fame, I mean when he was a Globetrotter he must have been famous?  BG: How did he deal with it? One day some kids were talking to him and I remember him telling them.  [end of tape one]  CH : This is Cecile Houry with Betty Gibson with tape 2. We were talking with how he dealt with fame. Can we talk about that?  BG: Okay, he was talking with a group of students and he said, “Fame is okay, but it was a job, ” and when you go on a job, you do the best that you can do, and all the fame that you want will come, if you’re good enough to achieve it. But you’re not going to a job saying, “I’m gonna be famous, I’m gonna be this,” you have to put your work in it, once you put work into it, and then you’ll get the rest out of it.  CH: What can you tell me about Abe Saperstein, like his personality or his financial crisis…  BG: The only thing I know about Abe Saperstein was that, when my husband went to work with him, and he signed a contract, he also signed a contract for me. I was paid by Abe Saperstein twice a month. I got a check on the first and the fifteenth of every month.  Betty Shannon Gibson 26  November 24th, 2000  CH: To do what?  BG: It was my money. My husband didn’t have to send me money. I got my own money. That part came out of his check, he never had to worry about whether he paid or sent me money, or anything, I got that every month. For four years I got that, and our house was broken into the sixteenth of every month [laughs], because I would take the tips (?) and leave them on top of the dresser.  CH: Some black players criticize Saperstein saying that he was using black people to make money, but that he didn’t really care about their integration, or them; do you agree with that?  BG: I never gave it any consideration. Basketball was not part of my life. I had a husband, who was a basketball player, and I loved him, and I never saw my husband play, but twice.  CH: Really?  BG: And we were married thirty-five years, before he died.  CH: Wow. But did he tell you how Saperstein was behaving with players?  BG: No. We never talked about it. We talked about things that happened, and travel, and everything, but we never talked about Saperstein.  CH: So can you tell how the team worked, like the organization?  BG: Ok, when my husband started playing, they had a situation that most people didn’t know about. When my husband played—  CH: What was the year he started? ’60?  BG: No, he started with the Globetrotters, [pause] ’63, ’63.  CH: So what was the team like, the organization?  BG: Now, there were three Globetrotter teams when my husband played for them. Betty Shannon Gibson 27  November 24th, 2000  CH: Really?  BG: Yes. And my husband played on the international unit. He played on the team that traveled around the world. And Meadowlark Lemon would be flown into the major cities to perform. So people never knew that Meadowlark was a United States predominantly player. And if they went into Germany in a certain town, that was outstanding, Meadowlark would get flown in and he would perform.  CH: So he was playing on the US team, and your husband was on the international one, and he was just joining them.  BG: My husband played on the international unit. Then they had one team that hit all the major cities and that was Meadowlark in that team. Then they had a lower team that went to smaller cities up throughout and around.  CH: How were the players selected for which teams?  BG: I don’t know. I don’t know how they were selected. But that was what happened. And, the one who has the bald head, oh, what was his name, gosh, [voice from background suggests Curly] Curly, Curly, played with my husband. They came out of college the same time.  CH: Did you know how they practiced, like how many times they practiced?  BG: I don’t know how many times, but I can tell you this: their practice was just like the other NBA and so forth. They had a book, and they couldn’t let that book get out of their hands, not one time. It was secret; you could not handle that book.  CH: Did the players have particular things to do or could they improvise during the game or the show, because it was a show?  BG: Everything came out of that book. Everything you saw them do, it was to a tee. You could go to page this, look on the page there, and you will see that is what is supposed to be done. And if you did it and you weren’t supposed to do it, you were fined.  Betty Shannon Gibson 28  November 24th, 2000  CH: What was his schedule like…practicing in the morning, or traveling; would they travel every night?  BG: I don’t know…they would travel, yes. The, I was home here in Miami; wives could not go anyplace. You could meet them. My husband would send me a ticket, I would take Delta, fly into Chicago…when they would finish in that area, I would get a plane, and come back to Miami. One time I took a train, I just wanted to see, how long would it take for a train to get there, and my husband told me, “Now when you get there, you tell the cab driver to take you across the street, because the Hilton Hotel is right across the street from the train.” He said, “If not, they’re going to take you around the loop, and they’re going to charge you all this money.” So when I got there, I told the taxi driver, “It’s cold, I can’t walk across the street, and I have a baby. Please take me across the street, go out the parking lot, down the street, and right there to the Hilton.” And in that way, you got out, but you know, they practiced.  CH: There was a debate whether the team was, you know like a good basketball team or just a good showmen team. What do you think about that?  BG: They were good basketball players.  CH: Compared to the NBA?  BG: They were good. They just weren’t good enough to stay with those NBA unless they wanted to. If they were that good…. because Chamberlain, he was a Globetrotter. And there were about four others that were Globetrotters. If they could get there, which you would find…and during that particular time when my husband came, you would talk about segregation, theywere not going to let too many black players on a NBA team unless you were super good.  CH: How were the Globetrotters perceived by the white people?  BG: Terrific. If you look at the audience, you see who was in the audience [….] They wouldn’t have survived if white people were not there.  CH: But do you think they were seeing them as basketball players or as clowns?  Betty Shannon Gibson 29  November 24th, 2000  BG: Both, both. Because that’s why sometimes they would take a NBA team and drop them with the Globetrotters to play. And I used to ask my husband, I said, “Were you all supposed to let them win?” He said, “It’s according to what Saperstein and the other coaches decide.” He said, “If they told us to go for it, we could beat the hell out of them.”  CH: Oh, that’s interesting. And how was they perceived by the black community?  BG: They loved them.  CH: And so they went to see them?  BG: Yeah, they went to see them.  CH: And how were they perceived by the NBA players?  BG: I don’t know. I would read about it…like I said, I was not- I had a basketball husband who was this and that, and I saw him play, twice.  CH: During the ‘60s, I know that black people criticized the Globetrotters saying that they would perpetuate black stereotypes, or like as “coons” symbol, Uncle Tom…what do you think about that?  BG: It happened because segregation was very deep during that time. During the ‘60s when they were playing, there was not desegregation, it was not there. They rode buses from one city to the next, unless they were coming to Miami, if they were coming to Miami, they’d jump a plane. But when the traveled, especially in the Northwest and so forth, they rode buses. The night my husband gave up the Globetrotters, he gave it up in Canada, playing on an outdoor court.  CH: Why did he give it up?  BG: Because he had been home for the holidays. They had come home that year. And he went back and he said all of a sudden, here he is a man on an outdoor court and it’s freezing. “Are you gonna be a fool and do this the rest of your life or are you gonna walk away and do something else?” Betty Shannon Gibson 30  November 24th, 2000  CH: What year was this?  BG: 196…66, 67, school year. That’s how I relate to things [laughs]. And that night the phone rang in our house, and I picked up, and he said, “Hey girl, whatcha doing?” And I said, “Nothing,” he said, “Come get me,” I said, “Come get you? From where?” And he said, “From the airport,” I said, “Airport?” he said, “Yeah, I’m coming home.” I said, “Thank you, God.” Remember now, he had been playing since 1959. And he would leave in August, and come back the end of March.  CH: When he stopped playing, did he still follow the results?  BG: No. You know, that was interesting. He told me one day, I said, “Are you going to see the Globetrotters.” He said, “You crazy?” He says no. I said, “Why not?” He said, “That was my job. That is not my job anymore. That part of my life is over.�����  CH: I know that the Globetrotters played in several movies, I heard about two of them. Do you remember that?  BG: The movies? I have the movies somewhere. My husband was not in one them.  CH: Do you think the movies were popular?  BG: I don’t know. I really don’t know.  CH: What about the TV series? There was a TV series about them.  BG: It was a series, but it was a cartoon. It was interesting to the kids, but I don’t think the adults really tuned in that much. I don’t believe they did.  CH: And what do you think the goal of the program was? Just to show them basketball players?  BG: Show them basketball, show them Globetrotters, that they were part of an environment, and let them know about them.  CH: Do you think they played a role in the integration of black people? Betty Shannon Gibson 31  November 24th, 2000  BG: They played an important role because when Saperstein started the Globetrotters, black players were not playing with the NBA or any other. And he brought them in to say, “These people up there, they’re basketball players.” And they did, they performed under the most adverse situations you would want. Where they had to play, they could play in the Miami arena and then they had to find a home to find a place to sleep. And they did this, and this was part of the integration movement. Wilt Chamberlain went into the Globetrotters, and he went from the Globetrotters all the way up. He was a terrific person.  CH: What do you think about the Globetrotters today, because a black man owns them now?  BG: He is an ex-player. He played with my husband.  CH: Mannie Jackson?  BG: Yes.  CH: And do you think they still have effect here (?), touring around?  BG: Well, they’re still performing, and I went to see them, two years ago. I took thirteen kids. My granddaughter wrote a paper, sponsored by the Herald. They were bringing Globetrotters, and it was given to the public schools to get the kids to write essays on why they think the Globetrotters are important, and what would they want from them, and my granddaughter wrote this about her grandfather, was a Harlem Globetrotter, and the things he did, and she put in there, the one thing he said that was closer to him than everything else, was that one-man audience, and that was the coach. They played for the coach.  CH: How was it for him to play for the coach?  BG: He loved it. He said that was the best of everything, because this person, he knew, would watch him (…) (?). And my granddaughter wrote that. And she said, “And the part I want most of all, I want a Globetrotter shirt for myself, because my grandmamma won’t let us touch his.” [Laughs] And she won, and she got five tickets. But that was the first year I had ever - and I did this before she wrote - I called the Globetrotters’ office, told them who I was, and told them I wanted some tickets to take my grandkids to see the Harlem Globetrotters. And they called me Betty Shannon Gibson 32  November 24th, 2000  back, and asked me how many tickets did I need, and I told them I needed six tickets, and they said, “Ok, you can have it.” And then my granddaughter won the contest and they gave her five! [laughs] So we gave them…no, they have to be relatives, I cannot take kids to this game unless their relatives, because that’s what I told them. So I pulled together all the little cousins, and we took those kids over there two years ago. And when I got there, I started looking, and I said, “Oh, the coach, the coach,” I said, “No, it can’t be.” So afterwards, we had the autographs going, and I had taken one of the old programs, and I turned to the head coach and I went up, and instead of giving him the current program, I pushed this program through, and he looked at the program and then he stood up, and he was trying to find who had given him that program. And I just stood there. And he said, “Betty Gibson.” I said, “You remember me.” He said, “Yes. Your size has changed, but you’re still there.” But he autographed everything, and he asked me, he said, “Did you bring some kids? I know you did.” I said, “Yes.” He said, “Get all your kids.” And he led us across the way, and we went down into the locker room and the kids were…they just had a terrific time.  CH: I’m sure they did.  BG: And my daughter did, too, because my daughter had never seen the Globetrotters. One time, but she was a little girl, she didn’t remember it. So we all went and we took all the kids and they got autographs, and they had fun.  CH: You said you saw your husband playing once or twice before- what was the difference with the Globetrotters you saw, when your husband was playing and—  BG: I never saw him play with the Globetrotters. I saw him play once at college, and I saw him play once with Chicago.  CH: I see. I’d like to come back a little back on his life. When did you get married?  BG: 1959.  CH: And how many children did you have?  BG: One.  Betty Shannon Gibson 33  November 24th, 2000  CH: One daughter.  BG: I had one daughter. He had a son before we got married.  CH: And can you tell me what he did after he retired from basketball?  BG: Ok, when he retired from basketball, it was the year I got the federal grant from the government to go to school, and he had been telling me that he wanted to be a policeman. And I said, “My God, please don’t do that, please. I can’t sleep if you do that.” He says, “Ok, I won’t.” Well, every summer he had come home, he had worked with Firestone Stores; he was the, how would I say this, it wasn’t a mortgage, it was the bill-reducer. He would have all the accounts of people who had not paid their bills, and he worked on those during the summer. So when he came back, he went back with Firestone and he was working there. Well, I packed my bags, and I went to Virginia State that summer, and he would write, and he would talk to me on the phone, but he would never say, this is happening, this is happening, he would just say, “We’re having a good time; I’m going to Tallahassee for the weekend,” and so forth. Then I opened a letter from my mom - I guess I had been there for about five weeks - and here was an article from the Miami Herald, and it said, “From Court to Court.” That meant from the basketball court, to the court, and there was my husband standing up there in a police uniform. I said, “Why did he do this. He didn’t do this.” So I called my mom, she said, “I just want you to know, don’t tell him I told you, don’t say anything, just come on home.” And when I got home, and he picked me up, my daughter said, “Mommy, Daddy is going to be a policeman.” And I said, “What?!” He said, “Yeah, I’m in the Academy.” I said, “The Academy, what is that?” He said, “They train me to become a policeman.” I said, “Who are you going to be a policeman with?” He said, “The City of South Miami, of course!” I said, “I don’t believe this, I thought—” He said, “That’s what you want, it’s not what I want.” So he joined the South Miami Police Department, and he worked there four years, and from the police department they started talking to him about running for Council.  CH: Talking about politics, in general, black people have been a strong supporter from Franklin Delano Roosevelt. I’d like to know what he represents for you.  BG: Who? Teddy Roosevelt, I mean, Franklin Delano Roosevelt? He wasn’t part of my life.  CH: How do you remember him? Betty Shannon Gibson 34  November 24th, 2000  BG: I remember he ran three times, and that changed the Constitution. [Laughs] He put on there, no more three times. Twice, go out, stay, and come back. [Laughs]  CH: Most black people are Democrat, and I’d like to know your political affiliation on the national and local levels.  BG: Now, I am a Democrat. I was an Independent for umpteen (?) years.  CH: Why?  BG: Because I didn’t want to be associated with neither one of the parties.  CH: And why did you change?  BG: Well, you start thinking, who is going to influence this country, the Independents never were. Your ideas could be listened to, but nobody was going to act on them. So you decided, do I want to be a Republican, do I want to be Democrat. This is my reasoning. Franklin Roosevelt, I read about him. I read about Herbert Hoover, too. And all these different things…what do they have that is influential in this country? What is going to make this country work-- nothing really, but who is going to do the best job?  CH: And what about the local level? What do you base your vote on?  BG: With South Miami, the best person, the best person, who is going to the job here in South Miami. And are they going to be man enough to go beyond our small politics and include the politics that is happening in Florida and Dade County.  CH: Can you tell me about your husband’s involvement in South Miami politics? When did he start running for office?  BG: He became a policeman, in 1966. And there were certain things that he thought that should be included because he figured that blacks were not given a fair deal, because they didn’t have anyone down there on the council. My husband was the first black man elected on the South End. Betty Shannon Gibson 35  November 24th, 2000  CH: That’s what pushed him to be elected, because he wanted to better black people’s life?  BG: That’s right, and especially young people. He had a craving that young people needed somebody. They needed an example of somebody who was going to talk to them, be an example and push them along the way, and let them know that they could achieve far more than someone saying, “Go to school. Once you go to school, you finish school, that’s the end of your life.” And that’s the beginning of your life. And he just wanted that. And one thing he was very fed up with South Miami, and here we’re back to the park situation.  CH: I heard he did a lot with Lee Park.  BG: He did. I used to get so upset. And one time he was pushing for a pool. They needed a pool because there wasn’t any blacks around here with a swimming pool. Kids could not swim. Kids were drowning over there at Blue Lake and so forth. And he pushed, and pushed, and then the city manager said “We’re gonna get a pool. Commissioner Gibson, we’re gonna get a pool.” And when the pool showed up, my husband got so upset, I thought he would have a stroke or something. You know what the pool was? Take a guess.  CH: It was like really small, tiny.  BG: It was a rubber pool, that’s what it was. You know, and they said, “This is something the kids could play in.” He told them they didn’t want anything they could play in, like that.  CH: So you told it, he was the first black city commissioner, so that meant for the first time black people were represented directly in the city council. So what other measures did he push for in favor of black people?  BG: I know one thing he did. His things were always for kids. And they started, it was like an after school house, but it wasn’t an after school house. It was a place that they could go and have something to do. And it was down, where? It’s a market there now, 62nd Avenue. It’s next to the service station. It’s like a mini market. And he was able to get a federal grant to bring in this particular program, where kids could go there, play cards, shoot pool, and do a little bit of everything in that facility. But what he objected to, it wasn’t operated the way he wanted it. Betty Shannon Gibson 36  November 24th, 2000  CH: What about? What did he want?  BG: He wanted someone in there who knew what they were doing, not just to put anyone in there. My husband was a person that, you just don’t put a person there to say, you’re covering, these are black kids. Just have someone, I hire you because you want the job and you are doing what you need to do. Because you weren’t trained to do that. And he pushed that. And the next thing he became a part of, was the police department going into the schools. He was the one that pushed that program and it is now all over.  CH: You mentioned first when he stopped being involved in the political system in South Miami and I read that it was during an election, a debated election, with Mrs. Janet Launcelott. Do you remember that?  BG: No, not with Mrs. Launcellot.  CH: Who was it about?  BG: It was with, what’s the other lady? No, it wasn’t with Launcelott. She became the mayor. McCann!  CH: Oh, because I read an article about an election for a commissioner seat that was really close between…  BG: No, it was McCann.  CH: So what happened?  BG: She beat him.  CH: And that’s when he stopped?  BG: That was in 86. He was elected from 1970 to 1986.  Betty Shannon Gibson 37  November 24th, 2000  CH: And why do you think she beat him?  BG: I would hate to say this because it is what you’re doing here, but I’m going to say it: she lied, she lied. She knows she did it, I know she did it, and both those campaigns, people know she did it. And I wanted to bring her down, I really did. And my husband said no. He said, “You don’t win elections by lying; you can win it here, but it’s gonna catch up with you.”  CH: What did she lie about?  BG: I can give you an example of what happened. We were doing a revision of one of the charters. And I was on it. My husband had suggested this, he was pushing this program. And they had to gather a committee to work it. I was on the committee; Cathy was on the committee, and the others. We had to elect a chair person for our committee. And we decided to be very cooperative, the entire committee. And we elected Cathy as chair of that committee because she wasn’t there that night, so she couldn’t give it up. So the committee, we operated that entire year. We came up with a lot of problems and so forth. And in her campaign, she put down there that my husband showed up to not one meeting. My husband was not on the committee, I was. I was the one that had to send all my credentials to the state of Florida. My husband didn’t have to send nothing for he wasn’t on there. And it was things like this.  CH: So that ended up your husband’s career in the political system of South Miami?  BG: Well, legally he was not part of the commission anymore. My husband never stopped fight for South Miami.  CH: Can you reflect on his political career in South Miami in general, like was he, did he enjoy it or was he frustrated about it?  BG: No, he wasn’t frustrated, he enjoyed it too much.  CH: Really?  BG: Yes. If there was any type of disturbances in South Miami, he was there. I remember in 1980 when the riot was. Betty Shannon Gibson 38  November 24th, 2000  CH: What was the riot about, can you tell me?  [End of Tape 2 Side A]  BG: There was a riot which was the outcome of a policeman killing a man. The riots were extended all over Dade County, and of course, there was reaction here in South Miami. My husband stayed up three nights, day and night, up there on the corner trying to keep things under control. And they had a city council meeting during that particular time. And this guy got up in the meeting, and he wanted to know what were the council people doing; they couldn’t keep order so he could sleep. And he just went down the line, tearing each one of the people to pieces. And that’s the night I got thrown out of City Hall. My husband told me, “Get up and leave.” You never knew when my husband was upset, because he had a peaceful demeanor about him. And I got up and I told that man, I said, “You could sleep because my husband didn’t sleep.” I said, “Whenever there is something going wrong in South Miami, you know that Spike Gibson is up there on that corner, because that’s part of his life.” And this went on, but he stayed on that corner, he was always there on that corner.  CH: I heard that Mayor Block once proclaimed a “Leroy Spike Gibson Day.” Can you tell me about that, like when it was and why exactly?  BG: Yes. There is a plaque that’s on a shelf back there. It’s a proclamation if you want it, you can take a picture of it. The proclamation was given the day that Florida A&M included my husband in the Hall of Fame for the state of Florida. And I think we had about eighty people who went from South Miami to Tallahassee to see this particular ceremony.  CH: After his political involvement, I think you started a business of your own. Can you tell me about that?  BG: Okay, we started that business in 1970 when he first became a member of the council. We had a security business.  CH: So what were you doing exactly?  BG: We provided security. Betty Shannon Gibson 39  November 24th, 2000  CH: In South Miami?  BG: All over the County.  CH: And you’re still doing that?  BG: No.  CH: When did you stop?  BG: We closed it down in ’88.  CH: I’d like to know what you think today is the most urgent need for South Miami?  BG: [pause] Urgent in what respect?  CH: The urgent measures to be taken for South Miami concerning, you know, whatever aspect you want, like traffic, or…What do you think is really needed right now?  BG: [pause] What I really see in South Miami now, I see a decline in blacks here in South Miami, and it has bothered me because we see all the new housing that has been initiated, but I also see blacks moving out. I see all the blacks dying, their homes being sold, and blacks are not buying in South Miami. They are other people; when I say other people, they are not black.  CH: Why do blacks not come in South Miami?  CH: I’d like to know what you think today is the most urgent need for South Miami?  BG: South Miami is an old community. It’s a settled community and blacks are not trying to come into the little small towns because it’s expensive. When you try to buy a home in South Miami, and you go to Liberty City, you’re going to get twice as much for your home, and you’re going to pay less there than the three bedrooms you want to buy here in South Miami. I have had people right around me who were black who moved out. And their homes were going to other people. Betty Shannon Gibson 40  November 24th, 2000  CH: Just to conclude, I’d like to come back on something that you mentioned before. You said that your mum was saving money because she thought you would go to jail, because you were doing the marches. Can you explain [to] me exactly what happened?  BG: Well, my sophomore year at A&M, we were in an assembly and all of a sudden, someone came in with a paper that said a bus driver had thrown a student off the bus because she refused to move to the back of the bus. And that was during the time when Martin Luther King was marching in Alabama and so forth.  CH: What year was that exactly, do you remember?  BG: My sophomore year, that would have been ’66-67, some place in that area. And we decided at that point that, no, we were not going to let this happen. That bus had to come through our campus. And I’m a sophomore and I’m sitting there, and I’m voting yes, we are not gonna let this bus come through this campus. So they turned the assembly out and everyone in the assembly walked to that street. That was my first time doing anything like that, and then later, I thought about it. I said, “You were stupid. You were a sophomore and you got on the front line with the seniors.” And I was-- here I am on the front line; if the bus is coming through, it’s gonna hit the person on the front first.” But we went through that, and we started getting instructions: how we do certain things, how we go downtown, and don’t sit here, we are going to sit there, and so forth. And it became part of our life.  CH: And you did some other marches, some other sit-ins?  BG: Yes. I would go out at night, but I had permission from higher-ups, how to get in and out of dorms. And I did this, and I told my mom I was doing it.  CH: But you never got arrested?  BG: If I had gotten caught, I would have been thrown out of campus because you had to be in the dorm by a certain time. But one of the guys who worked on campus, he had his car the places we would meet and etc, and he would bring us back on campus. And I told my mom, just save some Betty Shannon Gibson 41  November 24th, 2000  money. And she said, “I knew you were gonna do something.” She said, “I knew it, because I know you.���  CH: And did you do any protest when you got off college, like in Miami?  BG: No, I never did it. I just, I wrote things, and I wrote things and I protected black kids.  CH: What did you write things for?  BG: Opinions.  CH: But I mean, were they published in the newspapers?  BG: No, no, no, they went to the places I would want them to go.  CH: Can you give me, like a particular example about that?  BG: Well, say, no, I can’t use the name, I’m sorry. [laughs] But some politicians, if I wanted something known, I would write someone in Washington, or I would write someone in Dade County. I would do this, and they knew exactly what I was looking for and things had to be done. And even right there at South Miami Senior, one lady told me one day, she said, “You know, you’re a radical.” I said, “No, I’m not. I just don’t want you messing with my kids.” I said, “You criticized them when they are bad, and you straighten them up. Don’t tell them their clothes look good, that doesn���t mean a damn thing to their brain.” I said, “Now, either you work with the brain, or leave them alone.” And it was just that. I’ve always protected kids, not only black kids, I protect all of them. One of my best-known cases is with a Cuban kid. And I still have her. She calls me wherever she is, she calls. And that’s why I got very uptight when they start talking about-- separate kids from their families, their moms and dads, and let them stay with an uncle or something--you have to be very careful with your kids, that way.  CH: I see. But you were never involved in groups like the NAACP?  BG: Of course!  Betty Shannon Gibson  November 24th, 2000  42  CH: You were?  BG: Yes!  CH: In Miami?  BG: Yes, I’m a member now.  CH: So, can you tell me what you were doing with that group?  BG: Whatever they did, I supported them because my minister was the president. He and Father Gibson went all the way to the Supreme Court with Miami.  CH: Can you tell me what for?  BG: Integration of schools, integration of schools. Father Gibson’s son was one of the first black kids to go to a white school.  CH: And, were you involved with the black women’s movements, like the National Council of Negro Women?  BG: No.  CH: I’m gonna thank you for answering all of those questions. That was really nice.  BG: I hope that they help you. It didn’t seem like I’ve done anything. [Laughs]  CH: Sure they did. I would ---- without you helping me knowing what happened. Thank you very much.

The date is July 7, 1999, and we are beginning the interview at 10:58. The topics of discussion will include Ms. Carrasco’s experiences in Little Havana as well as her experiences growing up in Puerto Rico, and also as these experiences relate to public space issues. [unidentified noise] So we can do this in English? Is that—OK, great. Well, so I guess let me start asking you some questions about, first just your childhood and growing up in Puerto Rico and then later on we’ll move into, you know, experiences in Miami. First things first, though, what’s your date of birth and where were you born?  Ana Carrasco: I was born in San Jose, Puerto Rico, October 16, 1964. My parents migrated from Cuba in late ‘59, and then they transferred to Puerto Rico because of economic issues and language and what-not.  AR: And, what did your parents do for a living when they came from Puerto Rico?  AC: My parents, my father was a CPA, and he could work as a CPA. And he actually started immediately working. And my mother worked as a secretary in an American firm. Whatever Trust Company, I remember.  AR: And it’s curious you mention that they left Puerto Rico because of language issues and because of financial issues. Could you elaborate on that?  AC: Well, my mother grew up in Cuba in a German school, so she was fully bilingual. But my father comes from a very Spanish background. The English was a no-no. That family always wanted to return to Spain and English was a no-no. So he was not fluent in English. And then, they thought that being in Puerto Rico, the main language was Spanish, they could have more opportunities working there, staying here, not getting as much salary, doing something else but accounting.  Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  3  AR: OK, so it was, English here was just a--?  AC: A must.  AR: A barrier.  AC: Yes, a barrier, to get a decent job.  AR: Even, it’s curious, because you hear a lot that in Miami you could get around with just Spanish. But I guess that was--.  AC: Not in the late fifties.  AR: Not in the late fifties.  AC: Nowadays, you have to ask if you speak English. But then, that the population here was mostly Americans, you had to speak the language in order to get a decent job.  AR: OK. So how would you describe your childhood? Growing up, your experiences, yeah, what was that like?  AC: Well, coming from a migrant family, not being Puerto Ricans, even though they had decent jobs, it was very, very frustrating because you left your family, your roots, your houses. So my family was very, very poor at that time. Not poor that you were missing the basics, but poor in the sense that, having been raised in wealth and then living in a two-bedroom apartment was a big change. Not for me, because I didn’t know their way of living, but for them it was a very big change. So, our weekends were just going to a park, or going to the beach, or things that didn’t cost money. I remember and I have photographs of parks and that was our main entertainment. [laughing]  Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  4  AR: [laughing]  AC: We went to the parks on the weekend.  AR: Well, that’s great, actually, and those photos are something we might want to reproduce later on if you’d be willing.  AC: Sure.  AR: But, OK, could you—actually that’d be great—could you just list the parks maybe that you went to primarily and then we can go through them sequentially and you could give me an impression of what those places were like and what happened there?  AC: I remember in the metropolitan area there’s one big park. The Muñoz Marine Park, very close to the old San Juan section. And I don’t remember any other park that we visited but beaches. [door opens and shuts in background] And then, when I was in college, not college, but just finishing high school, there was a huge construction of Central Park, el Parque Central, where people used to go to play soccer, aerobics, to run after work. And then another park that I can’t figure how they managed to build, very, very close to the bank area. And I used to go there because I was taking photograph classes and it used to have beautiful scenery, until the ducks saw me as a threat. [laughing] And I was like, this is not for me.  AR: So it was now, you said the ducks now?  AC: The ducks. It was full of ducks because it had little lakes all around the park. For me it was a beautiful scenery, but I think the animals saw me as an intruder.  AR: [laughing]  Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  5  AC: So I ended up not visiting that park anymore because I was attacked. [laughing] On numerous occasions.  AR: [laughing] Really. And is this a problem, this was a recurring problem with this park? Was it that the park wasn’t maintained, or was it just--?  AC: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I was getting too close--.  AR: To close.  AC: To them. No, it was a beautiful park. It had, what do you call, eso carríto que se van por allí?  AR: Like a skyway type of, a sky, or a trolley?  AC: No.  AR: Not a trolley. A cable car, or a--?  AC: I don’t know how you call those.  AR: Were they multiple people, multiple person things, or--?  AC: Well no, they had seats. It’s sat ten or twelve people.  AR: Right.  AC: And you go through the park without having to walk.  Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  6  AR: Right. So that’s like a cable car, I guess. I guess, yeah. Interesting. OK, so, yeah, if you could describe in detail the types of things you did? We can take them one by one. Let’s go to Muñoz Marine Park, was that it? Yeah, if you could just describe what--?  AC: I remember as a little child they had playground stations, los famosos columpios cubanos. They had greenhouses, full of orchids and other plants that the city used to take care of. Dominos, which they were called back then, instead of dominos, here dominos? And they had like a schedule. Whatever group, you had to schedule your play. Very old people keep on reminiscing their good old ages. Um--.  AR: What did your, you went there with your family primarily?  AC: Yes.  AR: And what did you guys do there? What did you, a day at the park would be--?  AC: Picnics.  AR: Picnics? Did you--?  AC: That was the most un-expensive, I think, way of entertaining your little children without having to pay for something that they couldn’t afford because they [had] were just arrived.  AR: Yeah. Did you, when you were there, did you encounter other people at the park, or was it basically just you and your family as a unit?  AC: I don’t remember. People, I don’t remember other people.  AR: Yeah. [telephone rings] Not playing with other kids, or--. Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  7  AC: No.  AR: If you need to take that we can pause, it’s up to you. But yeah, if, not playing with other kids, [telephone rings] or anything like that, it’s just you and your parents. [telephone rings] How long did you stay at the park?  AC: I would stay all afternoon.  AR: All afternoon?  AC: [telephone rings] I remember that we were so tired, that we would just go home, take a bath, and go to sleep. We were very little though.  AR: How many of you, did you have siblings?  AC: Yes. I have a brother, two years younger than me. And it was my mother, my father, my two grandfathers [laughing] that came from Cuba too, my aunt, and us two. And I have a whole bunch of pictures. But I can’t remember other people or other children.  AR: Yeah, or do--?  AC: I remember old people playing dominos.  AR: Do you remember what type of things they would, they would talk about or--?  AC: I remember that there were people that were not raised in the metropolitan area because they talked about their own cities or own towns and how it was very different from living in the city. No alcohol, though. No alcohol. No wives.  Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  8  AR: No wives?  AC: No, it was just the men.  AR: And so, what other types of people do you remember from the parks? Not necessarily hanging out with them, but just seeing there?  AC: The people that took care of the greenhouses. I assume there must have been plenty of children it’s just that I can’t recall.  AR: Yeah. Do you remember any--?  AC: Then growing up in Central Park, plenty of people. Old, young, working, non-working, children, little children, everybody. And different cultures.  AR: Like what, if you could elaborate on that? [unidentified noise]  AC: Well, not only Puerto Ricans did migration, like here. We had Colombians, we had plenty of people from Spain. The Spanish club, we practiced soccer at Central Park. A whole bunch of people from work, young people, from work gathered at five, five-thirty.  AR: Work from just a specific location, or just work from around the city?  AC: From the metropolitan area.  AR: Yeah.  AC: Because it was very close to Old San Juan, where a whole bunch of peopled worked. They gathered there for aerobics and then to, for track and field. And they also practiced soccer, like two, three times a week. Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  9  AR: So were these events, events that were sponsored by the park, or were they independently organized by--?  AC: Well, the track and field and the aerobics [were] was sponsored by the park, no charge. They had tennis courts and of course you had to schedule, and then you had to pay a small fee to reserve a court. Soccer you could use the soccer courts at no charge. As a matter of fact, the association from Spanish club used to reserve the fields for us to practice.  AR: And at this, at Central Park, or el Parque Central, was it different there in terms of the way--? I mean, here you would, would you go primarily with your family or was this something that you would go to on your own?  AC: It was a family affair--.  AR: Oh, so this was—  AC: If I had to practice, everybody would go. It’s like Qué Pasa USA, that if somebody gets sick, everybody goes to the doctor’s office. [laughing] It was a family affair. And many people, many people that used to jog and run, used to take their car seats, their strollers, and take the children. It was every age. These I can remember better because I was, like, what, twelve, thirteen.  AR: Right. At this stage, do you remember interacting with other people as well?  AC: Jam-packed.  AR: Jam-packed?  AC: Jam-packed. Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  10  AR: So you--?  AC: We used to get there early for the soccer practice, and we used to get into the aerobic class, and then jog through the court, and then go to a practice. And it was full of people, full of other children. As a matter of fact, other clubs, the Colombian club, and the Lebanese club, that were also practicing soccer. We sort of mingled because it was a family affair.  AR: Right, right.  AC: [laughing] My mother used to make many, many friends because she had to sit there and, you know, chaperone.  AR: [laughing] So, you mentioned different clubs, Colombian, Lebanese. Were, or did these clubs tend to--?  AC: We all played there.  AR: Separate themselves ethnically, or--?  AC: No.  AR: No.  AC: We knew each other because we played against each other. Well, we would have mingled with each other.  AR: Right.  Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  11  AC: No. Especially, I don’t know why. I grew up in this Spanish club, and they tend to think of their ethnicity as being better than others. And you wouldn’t mingle with Colombians, are you kidding, hmph! [Eso era…?]. [laughing] And Lebanese? Unh-unh. Even Mexicans.  AR: How were the Lebanese seen?  AC: They’re very clannish. They don’t mingle with anybody else. And they speak their own language, so nobody will understand what they’re saying.  AR: And how are the Mexicans perceived by the Spanish, by the Spanish club?  AC: They were better off with the Mexicans but still wouldn’t mingle with the Mexicans. It’s--.  AR: It’s the way it is.  AC: It’s a culture.  AR: And when you say Spanish, you mean Spanish as Español, not Puerto Rican, not Cuban. Spanish.  AC: No, no, no, no. Spanish.  AR: Spanish.  AC: Spanish.  AR: Did you ever--?  Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  12  AC: Even though I was a third generation because, well second generation, because my father born up in Spain but he grew up in Cuba and then we were raised in Puerto Rico, we were second generation, but they still consider them, our generation being, like, Spanish. Not even Cubans because my parents, they didn’t have anything but they were raised in Cuba. So it was like, you don’t mingle with anybody else.  AR: Was there also, were there also Puerto Ricans?  AC: In the club. Yes. No, no, no, in the Spanish club.  AR: In the Spanish club there were also Puerto Ricans?  AC: Because either you were second generation or third generation, but they tend to mingle with the Spanish.  AR: Was there a Cuban club?  AC: There was a Cuban club but they didn’t play soccer.  AR: Huh? What did they do?  AC: Cubans play baseball.  AR: Baseball. Yeah, of course, that makes sense. [laughing] And so, there was not much interaction with the Cuban club then, they were almost separate?  AC: No.  AR: They were separate.  Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  13  AC: It’s a whole different ball game.  AR: Here’s something that I’m curious about because, you know, here in the States it’s such a big issue, and that’s African Americans, people of African descent in Puerto Rico. Did they fit into the scheme at all in terms of the different clubs? Did they use the parks as well? What’s the situation in terms of race, not necessarily in terms of race, but--?  AC: Puerto Ricans don’t, I don’t think they’re racist. There’s such a mix in Puerto Rico, like the Hispanics and the Indians and the Africans that were brought to the islands to work, that there’s a saying in Spanish, mainly in Puerto Rico [“si no tiene de congo, tiene de canabarí”]. So, you have in your blood Spanish blood, and you have Indian blood, and you have African blood. So the Puerto Ricans are not known as racists, as for example the Cubans tend to be more racist. In Puerto Rico, you can have a brother that’s very light skinned color, light hair, and you can have another that seems like a café con leche, that’s a mixture. And you can have another brother or very close relative that’s very dark skinned color. And they don’t seem to [care] matter, that gama. Cubans do tend to be more, what would you call it--?  AR: I don’t know.  AC: Not racist but--.  AR: Conscious of--.  AC: Concerned about colors.  AR: How would you, you know, if you have Puerto Ricans kind of not being so conscious and Cubans being more conscious, how would you rate Americans, just out of curiosity? Just stepping out of, for a moment, in the spectrum of racism or consciousness of race?  Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  14  AC: Well, I, I--.  AR: Do you think Americans are any more racist than Cubans, or would you say--?  AC: I don’t know. My experiences in Puerto Rico and then here—and the Americans in south Florida, I think they’re so used to having Hispanics that [pause] I don’t perceive them as being racist as if I would have lived in another state. I would say that, for example, Georgia, there they’re very, very racist. So I don’t have a point of comparison.  AR: And, anyway, that was just an aside, I was just curious on that. But in terms of, OK, so race didn’t matter so much in Puerto Rico and these parks--.  AC: No.  AR: So would there be people of darker skin in the Spanish club, for instance?  AC: Yes.  AR: In the Spanish club, interesting. And they considered themselves Spanish?  AC: I grew up in a Catholic school where only wealthy Puerto Ricans or sort of wealthy Cubans send their children. Because it’s not like here that everybody goes to a public school and it’s OK, and it’s a good school. Back there, if you have a certain economic position, you don’t send your children to public school because very low income, not only economic but social class, goes to public school. And there were people of all colors. If you were intelligent, and you could survive in that plan, no matter what color.  AR: And, that’s another issue, the issue of class then. How class conscious was the society that you grew up in, in Puerto Rico? Was there—you mentioned your parents were poorer Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  15  because they had just come—was there any, ever any discrimination against your parents in terms of, based on money, on class? Do you remember any of that?  AC: No.  AR: You don’t have any recollections of that?  AC: No, I do. I do.  AR: Oh, you do?  AC: I do. I remember when I was very, very little that they had no friends whatsoever because they were just arrived. They had just arrived from Cuba. And I remember my mother mentioning, we just got here and our neighbors were offering soup because they knew my mother was pregnant and she knew nobody.  AR: So then--.  AC: And it didn’t matter who she was, or who we were, they were offering café, and goods, and chicken soup, and you need to rest, we’ll take care of you while your husband goes to find a job, and we’ll help him. And I remember. I have those recollections of them talking about how they were helped by people that they didn’t know at that time.  AR: That’s great. That’s great.  AC: They were able to put their own businesses, like, in two or three years because people moved and I know who can help you, and I know where you can go and work as a CPA, instead of working at a cafeteria or cleaning offices. People were very, very friendly. As of here, I grew up in Puerto Rico, so when I came here and I completed my Bachelor’s, and I wanted to stay for my Master’s…And Cubans here are very clannish, very, very clannish. If Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  16  you don’t belong to the big five, you don’t belong to the [laughs] big and wealthy here, and you’re nobody. As compared to Puerto Ricans who are so, so nice and so friendly, it was a clash. That’s why my parents don’t want to come and live in Miami. They said, no way. Now we feel that home is Puerto Rico. They don’t want to come here.  AR: Well, just to wrap up, for now anyway, parts on Puerto Rico, you’ve talked a lot about the wonderful experiences you had there. Do you remember any negativity at these--?  AC: I also remember the Christmas parties for my father’s business, he used to invite every single employee. And there were a whole bunch of parks, but outside the metropolitan area. Mostly on hills, very far away from, en el campo. And they had little shacks, and they took music, and trios and it was a whole day affair, for Christmas.  AR: And who would, they would go, why would they go out of the metropolitan area?  AC: I don’t know.  AR: No?  AC: Era un costumbre.  AR: [laughing].  AC: And for Christmas, you would go out of the capital, and you would go to a park.  AR: [unidentified noise] Was this a custom amongst everybody? Was it something that everybody did?  AC: Business owners.  AR: Business owners that did it? Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  17  AC: I don’t know why.  AR: And would it be, could you describe, did you ever go to these parties?  AC: Yes.  AR: What were they like? What was the, el ambiente?  AC: They were like fiesta [ jiuares?]. I don’t know, cultural music for Christmas, la tuna, I don’t know, how do you say that in English? Do you know what tunas are?  AR: No, no I don’t.  AC: Students from Spain that have, como un coro. Have you ever seen la tuna?  AR: I’ve never seen that. I can’t say I’ve ever seen that.  AC: The participants are called tunos. And they come from different universities in Spain to entertain people with Christmas song.  AR: Interesting. What type of music was it? Was it, uh--?  AC: Well, it’s mainly Christmas songs and Catholic songs--.  AR: Catholic songs? Like church music, that sort of thing?  AC: About the Virgin, yeah. They were beautiful.  AR: Yeah. Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  18  AC: And you used to [combine] contract those tunas or trios with cultural oriented music, and you would entertain the whole day. All your--.  AR: When you say cultural oriented, do you mean music from Puerto Rico, from the campo, from--?  AC: Exactly. La plena, la rumba, cultural music with Christmas themes.  AR: And who participated in the parties? Was it just the people--?  AC: It’s a family affair.  AR: So a family affair.  AC: The employees, and their families, and their relatives. It was hundreds of people.  AR: Wow, wow.  AC: With a big lechón and food for everybody. And they looked forward to Christmas, because its drinks, rum con Coca-Cola, and then music, and the food. That I remember too.  AR: That’s great.  AC: There was a rain forest that almost [laughing] everybody knows Puerto Rico about. It’s El Yunque.  AR: El Yunque, sure.  AC: We had once one of the Christmas parties there. You rent a huge shack. Like here, just there’s no mountains here. [laughing] And it was a family affair. Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  19  AR: What do you think that these parks, that you took away from these parks? What do you think these parks, how do you think these parks and these experiences in these parks affected you, positively, obviously positively? You haven’t mentioned anything negative.  AC: Well, it was the only vehicle to have quality family time, because when I was little there was no money for anything else, and we had a great time. And it was the only place that I think my parents could relax [telephone rings] from a very stressful week being migrants with their children, [telephone rings] trying to raise them in a different country with no means to do [telephone rings] otherwise. And then when they could, they’d prepare these fiestas for the employees, and everybody was the same. It wasn’t, my boss, or my supervisor, everybody was the same. And I think that it gives not only family, but other people a chance to interact.  AR: We talked about parks. What about beaches? You mentioned that you went to beaches a lot with your family, too. What was that like?  AC: That was peers. Not family affairs but you—I remember when I had the chance to go with, to school, and then when you’re a teenager, that’s a hang-out place.  AR: OK.  AC: The beach. [telephone rings]  AR: So, how were your experiences different there? [telephone rings] I mean, what did you guys, what did you do with your peers at the beach? [telephone rings] What would a day at the beach be like and could you describe that? [telephone rings]  AC: I don’t know if you have it here, but the beach was full of catamarani.  Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  20  AR: Catamarans. Well, I don’t know if that’s the same thing. A catamaran--.  AC: Sailboats.  AR: Yeah, sailboats. A two--.  AC: I don’t know how you call that--.  AR: They’re catamarans.  AC: Catamarans.  AR: And so you used to go out on the catamarans. Did you, um—you mentioned the parks, the divisions between, like, different groups of people. Was it the same sort of divisions of people at the beaches? Did you--?  AC: Same thing. The Cubans mingle with the clan or wealthy Puerto Ricans.  AR: Right.  AC: And the Spanish used to mingle with everybody else. But Lebanese. [laughing]  AR: [laughing] Right, right. So, um--.  AC: Of course, there were beaches that nobody would go to because [pause] your parents, they used to tell me, that part of the beach goes people that are no good--.  AR: Disreputable.  AC: Low life people, disruptive. And you wouldn’t go to that side, but--.  Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  21  AR: What type of people would those be? Those disreputable types?  AC: Low economic sector. That it’s not because of the money but because of their attitude that was kind of disruptive, more than their economic background.  AR: What type of activity would these people do, or would you hear about these people doing?  AC: Drinking.  AR: Drinking.  AC: Very aggressive--.  AR: Aggressive.  AR: When they used to drink. Very loud. Salsa, for example. That type of music when I was growing up, here everybody loves salsa, everybody dances to that rhythm. When I used to grow up in Puerto Rico, salsa was something that was not [pause] socially correct.  AR: Right.  AC: It was like a low life dance. You would dance to every other rhythm but salsa. That was low life entertainment. And I never learned how to dance to that rhythm till I came here that it was socially accepted. And I said, well I don’t know, but people here, you know, [laughing], it’s not a class matter.  AR: And were there ever peers of yours who would--?  AC: Cross the boundaries? Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  22  AR: Cross the boundaries?  AC: Oh yes.  AR: Yeah.  AC: Yes. They’re revolutionaries. I don’t know. [laughing] I don’t understand why, but I like it and I would dance to whatever music I liked then. I was kind of formal when I was growing up.  AR: [laughing] So you wouldn’t cross the boundaries. Would a lot of your peers cross the boundaries, or not many, the fringe? [pause] Were drugs a big problem at that time when you were growing up?  AC: I don’t think so. Not in my school. I would assume that there were drugs, like, in every other time and every other school but I, my peers didn���t use drugs.  AR: You didn’t encounter that?  AC: No. [pause] I had never seen people using drugs until I came here to the university. My roommate used to do it as a common practice. And say well, I don’t care what you do, it’s OK with me, but I’m not going to do it. In order to be part of a group I never said anything but, it wasn’t my interest. But it was very common, very, very common. Not coke, but marijuana.  AR: Marijuana, yeah.  AC: It was very, very common.  Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  23  AR: You mentioned drinking, loudness, salsa, but also potentially violence from these marginal groups. Do ever remember encountering violence personally?  AC: I remember an episode that I will never, ever, ever forget. And we were coming from a family reunion, like eleven, twelve, or maybe it was later, but I thought that it was very, very late for me because I was very little. And we were waiting for the red light to turn green. And the car right in front of my father’s was waiting for the other car to continue moving. And he wanted to move and, I don’t know if--.  END OF TAPE 1, SIDE A  START OF TAPE 1, SIDE B  AR: This is Aldo Regalado continuing the interview with Ana Christina Carrasco at her Little Havana office, Centro Mater. The time is 11:30 and it’s July 7, 1999. Did I get your, did I say it right?  AC: Carrasco. [laughing]  AR: Good, OK. [laughing]  AC: [laughing] I thought you were going to say Rodriguez was about to crack up!  AR: [laughing] No, no, no. So anyway, you were saying, continuing the story--.  AC: Well, that man pulled over, with a gun in his hand, and he shot the other man.  AR: And you witnessed it?  AC: Yes. And I remembered it clearly. [pause] Just for honking the horn, because he wouldn’t move.  Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  24  AR: And was it, do you, how old were you when that happened?  AC: I don’t remember but I was very little, like, six or seven.  AR: Wow.  AC: I remember my father’s car. I remember the street light. I remember every single thing. As a matter of fact, when we went over a couple of weeks ago, I took my husband because we were passing by [sound of jet in background] and I recalled that story, and he couldn’t believe it. And that, I think that has happened throughout times. Violent people, when they get drunk, you don’t know what they’re going to do.  AR: So that’s the type of person that your parents would be afraid of, and worried about on the beaches, and stuff like that?  AC: They wouldn’t worry about color, but they would worry about those low-life, disruptive people and they associated drinks with salsa, being disruptive. And we wouldn’t mingle.  AR: That was a problem with beaches. Was it a problem with parks? Were there parks that were, that had those elements?  AC: No, I don’t remember--. Of course, people used to drink, especially at those Christmas parties, but nobody would get violent or drunk. Even though Puerto Ricans tend to, from Thursday on it’s, Thursday, pre-social Friday, and then social Friday, and they, I think they drink more than what—I don’t know. It was my assumption that, I don’t know. People drink more there. And they do drink more. I don’t know, here, with the happy hours, maybe people drink here, too. But, I don’t know, they drink a lot. I don’t know why. And it has surpassed social class. Everybody drinks now.  Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  25  AR: So that’s a, you’d say that’s gotten worse over time, or more prevalent, I should say, over time? It’s not, when you were growing up, it wasn’t so much; I guess that’s the impression that I’m getting.  AC: Or my impression.  AR: Let me ask you about other public spaces in Puerto Rico before we move on, and we may come back to some of this later. Museums, do you remember going to museums as a kid?  AC: The Museum of Art in Poncé, because it was a field trip. Poncé was two and a half hours from where we lived. So, we tend to go and have, like, the left wing and then the right wing. And it had two floors over, it has two floors, and we were little so [telephone rings] we took it by sections. And it was a big affair [telephone rings], because it was a very, very nice museum. But other than that, well the Pablo Cassals [telephone rings] Museum in San Juan. [telephone rings]  AR: My mom studied with Pablo Cassals.  AC: Verdad?  AR: Pablo Cassals Museum, and the first one was?  AC: The Museum of Arts in Poncé.  AR: Did you, when you went to these, did you go with your family again, or was it a school event?  AC: School and family.  Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  26  AR: School and family.  AC: Yes.  AR: And, well let’s take them one at a time again--. [unidentified noise]  AC: But, for example, children here are not exposed to comedies, and to, I don’t know how you would call it in English, but it’s called in Spanish, tertullias. Every Hispanic book that would come up, [telephone rings] the publishers would do, like, a meeting to discuss a book that was about to come out [telephone rings], and I would read everything that came out. Not only Puerto Rican literature, but Hispanic literature. There’s children here that are not exposed to those types of events. And it was a family affair. I would read tons of books.  AR: And this was something that you were exposed to at the Museum of Art [telephone rings] Museo de Bellas Artes, or was this--?  AC: Museo de Bellas Artes in San Juan.  AR: Sure, we’ll go ahead and pause. [recorder is turned off and on] OK, so that was at Museo de Bellas Artes in San Juan you said, where you got this exposure to theater and--.  AC: They had plays for little children, for adolescents, for every single type of population.  AR: And was it free?  AC: No.  AR: No, and so you had to pay for it. Was it very expensive to go there, or was it, do you remember?  Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  27  AC: I don’t know. We went back two weeks ago and we went to see two comedies in Bellas Artes and the most expensive ticket was, like, twenty dollars. So I wouldn’t say it’s expensive.  AR: Right.  AC: Compared to here, for a rinky-dinky thing that would cost you hundreds.  AR: OK, great. So, you did this with your family? Would you say that going to this museum was something that everybody did?  AC: I think that it’s, that families are more oriented, not only to family gatherings, but to cultural arts, to education. It’s a family thing. Children growing up here have never been to a museum. Well, my children maybe, but it’s not the common practice. You go to the malls. And you shop, and you buy things. Family affairs here are going to a mall to buy things.  AR: Why do you think that is?  AC: It’s, um, economía de consumo. All you think of, rewarding yourself, is to buy things.  AR: So you think even if there were museums, or plenty of museums--.  AC: I would say that it’s a matter of educating people. Or maybe, I don’t know, they were not as exposed to it as, growing up. They don’t teach their children that it’s a very nice outing to go to a museum to learn something, to go to a park to spend quality time together.  AR: Do you find that’s the case in the Hispanic community here as well? Or is that--?  AC: I’ve been taking my children to the Museum of Science in Broward and I’ve noticed that the majority of the population that attends those museums are Americans. Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  28  AR: Are Americans?  AC: I don’t see Hispanics. As a matter of fact, my children speak in Spanish to other children and nobody speaks Spanish. The majority of the parents taking their children to the Museum of Science and the Imax that recently opened here in Miami are Americans. The Butterfly World and other science museums in Coral Springs, those are our outings. When you have children, you have to plan accordingly. And my outings, it’s not going to the mall to buy things. I was not raised like that. So, we really enjoy going to a park. As a matter of fact, my brother has children, and we have three children, and our outings, especially on Sundays, it’s a family affair.  AR: Well, let’s talk about parks then here in Miami. How do you see them as similar or different to the parks that you had in Puerto Rico, that you frequented in Puerto Rico as a child? First, which parks do you go to here with your children?  AC: We’ve been going to Tropical Park and the Dante Fassell Park that it’s, I don’t know how you get there, but it’s, you take Old Cutler Road all the way down and you, that’s a very nice park to take your children.  AR: Yeah. Why is it a good place for children? I mean what, you know, if you could just describe it?  AC: Because the people that go there are families wanting to have a good time. They take their bikes. They do their picnics. They spend the day in a family affair.  AR: Does the park provide activities like they did in Puerto Rico or something like that?  AC: No.  AR: No.  AC: No. Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  29  AR: So you basically go there and make your own... Could you describe the park features, in terms of, you know--?  AC: Well, for example, the Tropical Park, we have a, we take our bicycles. There’s a bicycle track. And, there’s a playground for the little ones, because I have a five year old and an eight year old that love to go to the playground. There’s a huge lake that we take the bread that’s old on Saturdays and Sundays and we feed the ducks. And we make a, I know that many families, or it’s a, business related parties, they rent shacks and they have whole bunch of people to celebrate either a birthday or a business affair, but it’s mostly families, either bicycling or having a picnic.  AR: So, would you consider, do you consider parks here to be, at least the ones you frequent, safe places in general?  AC: Well, it depends on the area. I wouldn’t come here--.  AR: To, uh?  AC: At night, or during the weekends.  AR: Yeah. Your specific, what would be your concerns in terms of doing that, coming--?  AC: Here, even though the city fenced this park, I don’t--.  AR: That would be, that��s Riverside.  AC: That’s Jose Marti.  AR: That’s, I’m sorry, Jose Marti Park. Yeah. Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  30  AC: Even though it��s fenced, and they have security, drug users use the park at night. Sundown, not even night, and weekends. I don’t know why. Homosexuals that apparently don’t have another place to have sex, they have sex in the park. So it’s not kosher to bring the children. You can find needles. I have to send a supervisor every single morning to inspect the playground, because you can find needles in the sandbox, and that’s a liability.  AR: Yeah.  AC: Now there’s less of a problem now that it’s fenced, but still you need to check.  AR: Yeah. How about gang activity? Is that a problem in this area?  AC: I know that there’s [are] gangs in the area, because the police station, the net office, it’s a block from the Miami River Inn, and they patrol the area. And I know that there’s gang activity because they say it [jet noise in background], but not because we have been vandalized or, and you could see strange teens and youth, but I cannot really tell you that they’ve been vandalizing or there’s been drug dealings because it’s not my experience. I know of their existence because of their advice. We have a teen outreach program and we meet, coaches meet at night from six to ten. And the youth in the area or that, the ones that have been growing up here that are older, over thirteen, we have a program that’s eight to twenty-one, that either they belong to the racing team or they belong to the basketball team. And what we do is, having first supervised, not vandalizing the neighborhood, nor joining gangs, or drug use or abuse or dealing, we have them involved in sports, for example. Saturdays it’s a whole day affair. The coaches meet them here, and they either go to practice at Tropical Park, or the ones that are in the track and field, or the ones that, either basketball or baseball, it depends on the season, they meet here and either practice or play. They have counseling sessions. Peer pressure themes. They need to bring their report card. They need to show the coaches their homework done in order to play or practice. And it’s going great. Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  31  Our children, as far as we know, are not that involved in those youth issues in the neighborhood as gangs and pregnancy.  AR: So, you’re saying, yeah--.  AC: We’ve been using the park at night. That at that, our presence in the park takes away from those others that used to use it more often, like, to have sex or to do drugs. And I think our presence in the park has made a difference. Apparently they go to another place now, which is, were using the park.  AR: So how long has this program been going on?  AC: For two years.  AR: For two years. And so you’ve seen a steady improvement, uh--?  AC: Oh yes.  AR: Uh, in the--.  AC: Our, I think, our presence and the fact that the park was fenced has kept many of those individuals out of the park. They used to get together and drink. Now, I don’t know. Apparently they have found another park to go drink. But not here. You can see them, but it’s not as much as it used to be. And I would assume that other people knowing that they would not encounter as much of a problem, they would start taking their children to the park at night.  AR: Would you say, how about the problem with the homeless? Has that been a problem in this area?  Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  32  AC: No.  AR: No.  AC: No. That’s an issue that is from the river east. Since this community is divided by the Miami River we don’t have the homeless problem. You could see one or two but it’s not an issue.  AR: Right. Interestingly enough--.  AC: As compared to downtown, from the other edge of the river.  AR: Right. Interestingly enough, you know, the homeless were an issue with Lummis Park, right across the river.  AC: Right. Yeah, that was a public housing park. [laughing]  AR: Yeah. It’s not too much of a problem here, and it’s not an issue here.  AC: No. The issue here [were] was the drugs and homosexuals.  AR: Was it mostly youth that were, or was it older people--?  AC: Old.  AR: It was older people that were the issue.  AC: Many years ago we had a gang that used to meet in the park, but not anymore. It was a matter of one or two a month. I don’t know, apparently they came from another state. And they used to meet at the park. Not anymore.  Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  33  AR: Well, do you remember a time when Jose Marti Park didn’t have those problems?  AC: Well, I can remember thirty years ago when the other administrator and the nun that founded Centro Mater, Centro Mater used to be at the park, nobody used to use that park but that nun and the volunteers that came from Cuba that helped her. So Centro Mater had its operations in the park because nobody used the park.  AR: Nobody used it at all?  AC: At all. And then, when the city realized that Centro Mater was taking care of the children in a preschool basis and then receiving children after school from two-thirty on, that it was a full day operation, they did the pool, the basketball courts. And the Kiwanis Club of Little Miami that donated the huge playground that is, it’s the one that we use nowadays. And then people in the area, it was because of migration, there wasn’t many people living here back in those days in the early sixties. And now it’s like a ghetto. This is the starting place for many, many people. Not Cubans now, but Central Americans, mostly Nicaraguans, and Guatemalans, and Salvadorans. This is a starting place.  AR: And--. [unidentified noise]  AC: They don’t have means of transportation, so it’s same thing like my family. Since that was the only alternative for Saturdays and Sundays, they use the park now. [unidentified noise] And they use the pool.  AR: So the park gets heavy use now, not just from the marginal people you mentioned before, but in general, it gets a lot of use from the community.  AC: Nowadays, yes.  AR: And what sorts of things, what sorts of activities, go on there daily? Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  34  AC: Well, the racing team practices daily there. Either basketball, because of the season, or baseball, they practice every single day, and they play on Saturdays, and it’s all done at the park. Thanks to the donation of the Kiwanis, the playground is always full. The pool during the summer months - always full. And we had a, we had a team from the neighborhood, and they play soccer and they practice. And because the men practice, it attracts, like, other women and women with children because their husband or fiancé or boyfriend is practicing, they come more often.  AR: So it’s used, do the elderly come there at all? Are there the domino games that you had in Puerto Rico?  AC: No, no. I know that the domino games are still practiced on 8th where the domino park is, but not here.  AR: So it’s more the younger people.  AC: And I know there’s boxing practices conducted by a neighborhood group to keep teenagers out of drugs and illegal gambling and all that stuff, and vandalizing the neighborhood. So it’s used by a whole bunch compared to a couple of years ago that nobody used to go because of the presence of other people.  AR: [unidentified noise] We talked about the separation of other ethnic groups in Puerto Rico. Do you get that here at all? Especially since you have, I mean, do Nicaraguans, Colombians, Cubans, Puerto Ricans separate here?  AC: In this neighborhood? No.  AR: No. So--.  Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  35  AC: No. I think that since everyone that lives in this neighborhood is a newcomer, they tend to bond more easily because the basic needs are not met and you try to bond to whoever you can grab for support. That nationality is not an issue.  AR: Even between Cubans and other immigrant groups?  AC: No, no. Cubans don’t bond that easily. Ellos se creyan que son la última Coca-Cola en el desierto and they’re better than anybody else and I grew up like that.  AR: [laughing]  AC: I saw it in my family. [laughing]  AR: So the uh--.  AC: Eso muchacho no te convienen. Just because it was from another country. When I told my parents that I was dating a Peruvian, they went up the wall. [pause]  AR: [laughing] So--.  AC: They’re very clannish and very racist. I don’t know why, but that’s the way they are. And they protect their community very much.  AR: The Cubans, were talking about. Do you see that, do you see the walls in those regards crumbling at all in the neighborhood as more and more groups come in? Or, yeah, do you see any give there from the Cubans in terms of embracing others, even if it’s slowly?  AC: Well, I would say, the Kiwanis Club of Little Havana, and all the Kiwanis Clubs, they’re mainly Cubans.  Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  36  AR: Still?  AC: Still. They have made money and they’re wanting to give back to the community. Goya Foods, for example. One of our major contributors to Centro Mater is the Nonguey [?] and the Ortegas from the Goya Foods. Even though the majority of our children now are Nicaraguans, since not them, but the majority of the population here in the early sixties and seventies served in Centro Mater because of migration was Cubans, they still continue the mission through their siblings and their relatives. They have a huge fundraising every year, and it all comes to Centro Mater, not because the population is Cuban, but because they were immigrants once and they want to give that small push that can make the difference in many families. Not to have to pay for quality early childhood and to be exposed to good activities, they still contribute. So there are many, many Cubans that are willing to give back to a community, even though it’s not of Cuban origin.  AR: Right. [pause] Do you, how do you see the kids relating to each other here in terms of ethnic--?  AC: No barriers.  AR: No barriers. Cubans, Nicaraguans, Colombians, Venezuelans--.  AC: No barriers. Not even the Cuban newcomers, there’s no, and I think that other generations of Cubans, like my family, that would tend to be racist and clannish, since the population in Cuba now, it’s so different, that the population that my parents grew up in got very mixed…ahora, if you see a documentary from Cuba, the colors [are] is a very wide spectrum.  AR: Yeah, yeah.  Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  37  AC: They’re not that clannish. They’re, like, used to other ethnic groups. I have a whole bunch of rafters here that are mingling with Central Americans and South Americans that, my parents would have never done that, because they see or perceive themselves to be better than other groups. Newcomers are, like, used to other colors and other backgrounds and other ethnic groups.  AR: So what do you see as, I’m just making sure that we have, yeah, we still have, we’re almost done with that tape, what do you see the, how do you see the neighborhood developing in the future?  AC: Well, city and county officers are more conscientious of the importance of parks in areas, like for example, this area. They remodeled the park. They did another park, they remodeled the park that’s across Victoria, that used to be Victoria Hospital, that’s across from la Quimíca…[?]. It’s a beautiful park and they’re fencing it too, to keep it, uh… off street people or people that would not benefit from the use of the park. They’re creating more affordable housing for the area, not for the area to remain poor, but to have that sense of belonging and commitment and, this is mine, compared to, I’m renting and I don’t give a damn [for] of the building that’s not mine, I’m not going to take care of it. They’re creating, not low-income housing, but moderate, affordable housing, not for the neighborhood to remain being poor and it’s--.  AR: So you see it as a relatively bright, or at least a somewhat optimistic future for the neighborhood?  AC: I would say, I would say. They’re creating loan incentives for people to create businesses in the area, so I think they have realized that it’s a city problem and it’s everybody’s problem, because if there’s poverty here, and crime, and drugs, it’s a matter of citywide problem. Because somebody that’s not legally dealing drugs here can affect my children or my family that lives forty miles from here. So I think that we’ve had a wide Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  38  turnover of conscientious officers taking care of poverty pockets. And not only the parks, but the facilities and the businesses, not to remodel, but to renovate areas to attract people.  AR: How about something we haven’t really talked about, I guess because I’m trying to concentrate mostly on Little Havana specifically, but maybe we should mention something about the use of beaches here in Miami? How does that compare to Puerto Rico? Do you use the beach a lot here in Miami? Does your family go to the beach a lot here in Miami? Any particular reason why not, or--?  AC: We have a lake.  AR: OK.  AC: Behind our house. We tend to use the lake, to avoid the--.  AR: What do you--?  AC: And Miami Lakes.  AR: And Miami Lakes. OK, so it’s a transportation issue, the distance, the commute there--.  AC: Distance, I would say.  AR: OK, um--.  AC: But I know that the beaches are crowded. [telephone rings] It’s not that people don’t go, it’s just that, we don’t go because we have access [telephone rings] to the pool and the lakes.  AR: Right. I think we have enough tape to talk a little bit about the, comparative neighborhoods. Something we talked about public spaces in Puerto Rico and here, and the comparisons, made some comparisons, but neighborhoods. How would you describe the Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  39  neighborhood that you grew up in Puerto Rico and how is it different and how is it different than or similar to the neighborhood you’re in here in Little Havana? Well, not that, that you work in, in Little Havana, you don’t live here.  AC: Well, as I was telling you, Puerto Ricans are very friendly. We knew everybody, and if I was playing on the streets, everybody would watch for everybody that was on the street. [telephone rings] And I think that because of the social problems that were here in the area [telephone rings], people used to stay at home and play. [telephone rings] Nintendos because they thought it was safer. But now that things are taking [telephone rings], being taken care of, people tend to let their children out more than it used to be like a couple of years ago. That it was a threat, letting your children play on the street.  AR: So you think it’s a, people perceive it as a safer neighborhood now. It’s no longer--.  AC: Yes. I remember that I, when it was summertime, I used to spend the day in our block, always playing out. People don’t take to let their children out that much here, but because the area’s safer, they tend to use the park and let the children play outside more. Nowadays, you don’t know who your neighbor is, so you tend to keep your children inside. That’s my assumption.  AR: Yeah. Why do you think that is, that people don’t, that neighbors don’t know each other as well?  AC: Well, I remember that my family from Puerto Rico, you lived in a house and you would live there forever. No because of mobility reasons, for economic reasons, you tend to move more. And people tend to move to wherever you can find a better economic position. And you have a neighbor now and you wouldn’t have it here for two months, and then somebody else comes in. So then you really don’t know the neighbor. When I was growing up, you had a neighbor and it was like part of your family because you grew up with that neighbor for the longest and you saw generation after generation. It was like part of your family. But Ana Carrasco  July 7, 1999  40  nowadays, you don’t have that contact because people tend to move for whatever reason. Here for economic reasons and for other reasons, because they cannot afford to pay the rent, so they don’t give advice to the landlord and they move, not to pay that month. And for other reasons. Legal reasons. So it’s different.  AR: Well thank you so much for this. Is there anything that we’ve talked about, I’m sorry, that we haven’t talked about that you want to mention about the neighborhoods, public spaces, or any other concerns that you have? No, OK, well thanks again. Thank you very much.  AC: Gracias.
