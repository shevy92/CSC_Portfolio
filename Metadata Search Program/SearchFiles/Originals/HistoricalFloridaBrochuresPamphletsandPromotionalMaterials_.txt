On Christmas Day, 1916, James Deering opened,  after many years of travel throughout the world,  Vizcaya, located on the shores of Biscayne Bay.  His home was built around the priceless objects of  art gathered from far-off places. In 1952, by arrangement with the heirs, Dade County acquired  Vizcaya as a public museum.  Here on Biscayne Bay an army of 1,000 Italian  stonecutters, cabinetmakers, painters, plasterers,  gardeners, and other artisans worked for five years  to build the palazzo, carve statues and ornamental  stonework, complete the landscaping and install  the waterworks system for the series of fountains  and a chain of small canals.  SAILING DAILY  (EXCEPT SATURDAY) 10:30 a.m.  RETURNS AT 5:00 p.m.  FARE: $3.06, Plus Tax 480  TOTAL $3.52  Vizcaya's formal Italian Gardens were planned to  equal in detail and ingenuity the landscape masterpieces of Villa Albani in Rome or the Villa d'Este  in Tivoli. Mr. Deering had traveled widely abroad.  For twenty-five years he had collected in Europe,  architectural backgrounds, rare Period furniture, textiles, sculpture, and ceramics. To enshrine them he  built Vizcaya, his home until his death in 1925. His  palazzo on Biscayne Bay became a repository of  Italian decorative art unexcelled in America. His  art-loving heirs have kept it so to this day.  It is estimated that $16,000,000 was spent on the  construction of fabulous Vizcaya. Mr. Deering never  let it be known. No matter what the cost, Vizcaya  could not be reproduced today.

Vizcaya. The villa. The garden. The forest. The  museum. A "must see" on the list of all who visit Florida.  It began as the winter retreat of industrialist James  Deering, Vice President of International Harvester, and  evolved into his personal celebration of the European  decorative arts.  He roamed Europe, observing the architecture and  collecting paintings, tapestries and furniture. The ancient  country homes of the Italian Veneto appealed to him most,  so his new winter home was fashioned accordingly. And  on the day it was completed in 1916, it looked as if it had stood there for more than four  hundred years.  He named it Vizcaya, a Basque word meaning "elevated place." Today, it is preserved  as an impressive museum representing the Renaissance, Baroque, Rococo and  Neoclassic styles.  A day at Vizcaya is a day of wonderment. The villa's 34 rooms, arranged around a  central courtyard, provide an uncommon glimpse four centuries into the past.  The gardens invite contemplation and reflection. Colorful plant life embellishes the  Renaissance and Baroque designs. Sculptures, balustrades and decorative urns are poised  in silence, while the fountains, pools and cascades collectively add a poetic nuance.  A meandering trail guides you through a natural  hammock forest so dense that even the strong Miami  sun is eclipsed. The exotic and varied plant life gives  visitors a rare look at the terrain in South Florida that  flourished before the area's urbanization.  Considering the diverse and uncanny beauty of this  treasure called Vizcaya, it's no wonder that more than a  quarter-million people come to visit each year. And on  September 10,1987, Vizcaya had two very special visitors  -Pope John Paul II and President Ronald Reagan,  meeting in private on the first afternoon of  the pontiff's historical tour of America. 		image/tiff						156466836 Bytes	9598	5434	2481982261	RGB	8	600	asm02500000350002001.tif		2013-08-08	2013-08-08	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/15	15	16.jp2	/pamphlets/image/16.jp2

Everyone who  has settled in the area has come from someplace else. Some of the earliest settlers came  from northern states, and they or their parents  were immigrants. Many of the more recent settlers came from Latin America and the Caribbean. The people who have chosen to settle  here have often brought with them their own  ideas about culture, food, language, architecture and style.  Once here, these new ideas fuse with the  existing culture, creating the truly unique mixture identified with South Florida today. A  broad range of neighborhoods emerges. There  are those with a unique or specific architectural theme, like Coral Gables, Miami Shores  and Morningside, with their Mediterranean  Revival homes; Opa-locka's Moorish fantasies;  Miami Springs' Pueblo Revival visions;  Hialeah's Mission past; Miami Beach's Art  Deco; neighborhoods full of history like the  bay era represented by Coconut Grove and  Lemon City; the Black heritage of Overtown  and Liberty City; the recent history of Little  Havana and Little Haiti; rural areas like South  Dade, Homestead and Florida City; working  areas like Larchmont, Melrose, Carol City and  Little River; and bedroom communities in  northeast Dade County like El Portal, Biscayne  Park, North Miami and North Miami Beach. To  see how really different Dade is we suggest a  visit to one of our many colorful  neighborhoods.  For more information, contact Metro-  Dade Historic Preservation Division, CED at  545-4228; or Dade Heritage Trust, Inc. at 358-  9572; or Historical Association of Southern  Florida at 375-1492.

Since the early 1960s many of them  have settled in the "Little Havana" area of Miami, bringing with  them their own culture.  The heart of Little Havana is reminiscent of the character of  old Havana, Cuba. Gaslight-like streetlights and brick sidewalks  invite visitors for a stroll down tree-lined streets.  New businesses have begun to adopt the  Spanish style of architecture, with new  shopping plazas and even a McDonalds  on Calle Ocho sporting the motif.  The area was first developed in  the 1920s, with Spanish-Mediterranean  apartment houses being built alongside  the popular bungalow-style single-  family homes. Many of these  bungalows, like those  along the  100 and  1200 blocks  of S.W 7th  and 8th Avenues, used  native coral limestone in  the construction of their  chimneys and porch piers.  On the south side of  the Latin Quarter is S.W  8th Street, also known as  "Calle Ocho," the primary  commercial corridor in  Little Havana. Along this  street at 14th Avenue is  Domino Park, where  there is always a crowd  playing or watching the  daily domino games.  It is the most popular  urban park in Dade  County.  A cortadito break at an outdoor  cafe on "Calle Ocho".  "Calle Ocho Openhouse" held in March every year sets a sea of  humanity to the beat of a giant, day-long street fair. Typical Cuban  foods sold on sidewalk stands and top Latin entertainers performing on several stages along the twenty-three-block-long festival  provide the main ingredients to one of Miami's biggest parties.  Jose Marti Park is set right  on the busy Miami River.  Two blocks east of  the park is Cuban Memorial Boulevard, an  avenue dedicated to the  heroes of the Bay of  Pigs Invasion. Here the  flame of freedom burns  brightly, flags wave and stately trees frame the view  On the northern perimeter is Flagler Street, named for railroad magnate Henry M. Flagler, who really put the city on the map  by bringing the Florida East Coast Railroad to town. The street is  the dividing line between Miami's north and south sections.  At Flagler Street and 17th Avenue, the Quarter's northwestern  edge, is the "Plaza de la Cubanidad" which features a water sculpture by local Cuban artist Tony Lopez. The work shows a map of  Cuba featuring the faces of important Cuban Patriots. Six stately  Royal Palm trees reign over the park, one for each of the six provinces of Cuba.  There are many restaurants  in the area which feature Cuban  dishes, providing more than  ample portions of Picadillo,  Ropa Vieja, or Arroz con  Polio and Paella.  Delicious Cuban food draws  visitors to the Latin Quarter.  Not far from the Latin  Quarter, on the edge of Little  Havana on the riverfront, is  one of Miami's newest parks.  Jose Marti Park faces the Miami  River and is one of the most colorful  attractions in the area. It has a waterfall,  a swimming pool, covered picnic benches and a small cafe.  On S.W First Street and 5th Avenue is Warner Place, a 1911  mansion done in Neo-Classic Revival style. A series of frame vernacular buildings currently under rehabilitation line S.W 1 Street  at the intersection with the Miami River, one of the earliest building groups in the City of Miami.

The earliest settlers arrived  before the Civil War, but the area remained a wilderness until the  late 1800s.  Ralph Munroe, a sailing enthusiast, moved permanently to  Coconut Grove in 1888. He convinced Charles and Isabella Peacock  to start a hotel there.  Several black families,  mainly from the Bahamas,  settled in the area. One such  immigrant, E.WE Stirrup,  bought land and built  houses along Charles Avenue, the first black community in the county. The  Charles Avenue settlement  still thrives. Coconut Grove  emerged as a unique village  where rich, poor, black,  Veterans Day Parade  on Main Highway, 1925.  white, intellectual and uneducated people lived and worked  together without the usual geographic and social divisions which  separated other communities.  Munroe's residence on Main Highway, named "The Barnacle"  after its unusual design in 1891, is one of the finest examples of  vernacular architecture to be  found in Dade County. It is  now owned by the State of  Florida which operates it as a  park and museum, offering  tours at regularly scheduled  times.  After the building of  Vizcaya, the palatial estate of  millionaire industrialist James  Deering, the area along the  Bay attracted wealthy winter visitors, including such notables  as William Jennings Bryan and Dr. Leon H. Baekland  (the inventor of "Bakelite" - the predecessor of plastic)  who built many magnificent homes in the area.  The main thoroughfare through the commercial area  called "Main Highway" is lined with sidewalk cafes, specialty  stores and boutiques. The brick sidewalks are usually  brimming with shoppers, strollers, skaters, joggers or  sightseers.

He donated large tracts of land to the  county, including the site of today's international airport and the  north campus of Miami-Dade Community College. He was the  developer of many local communities, each of which had its own  special theme architecture. An area of northwest Dade, named  "Opatishawockalocka" by the Indians, became the planned city of  Opa-locka.  With a copy of "The One Thousand and One Tales From the  Arabian Nights" as a guide, architect Bernhardt Muller began  designing buildings with a Moorish motif. The area is one of the  most fascinating architectural exhibits in the county, and even the  homes sport minarets and domes. The main streets were laid out  in the shape of the crescent moon and were named after characters in the "Arabian Nights."  The style works best in  the buildings of larger scale.  In the downtown area,  visitors can see the  administration  building, now the  City Hall along  Sharazad Boulevard.  It has minarets,  a watchtower, domes,  cracked stucco,  quaint balconies,  pointed arches  and crenellated  parapets.  Just down the street is the Hurt Building, later known  as the Opa-locka Hotel, which has many of the same  details.  A minaret is silhouetted against  the sky on Sharazad Boulevard.

Across Ali-Baba Avenue from the Hotel is the Train Station,  whose entranceway features keyhole arches framed by hand-  painted imported tiles. It, too, has domes and a crenellated parapet. Opa-locka was the first stop in Dade County of the "Orange  Blossom Special." The train's arrival was celebrated with a parade  featuring participants dressed in Arabian costumes. Each year in  May the City continues the tradition with an "Arabian Nights  Festival."  For more information, contact City of Opa-locka at 688-4611.  Homestead  When Henry Flagler's railroad company extended the railroad  south from Miami, F.E.C. surveyor J.S. Frederick laid out the town  of Homestead some thirty miles south of Downtown Miami.  The city was planned as the  "home base" for Flagler's railroad  construction crews which would  build the "railroad that went to  sea" - the extension of the line to  Key West.  Most of the buildings in the  downtown area are from the 1950s  when business boomed from the  expansion of the nearby Homestead Air Base. But Homestead's  Krome Avenue is typical of the  earlier small town "Main Street,"  with some of the buildings dating  back to the 1920s as well as old  City Hall which was built in 1917  A few other pioneer buildings still remain in the downtown  area. The WD. Home building at 13 N. Krome Avenue was built in  1912 by the area's first postmaster, real estate agent, and bank  president; Home also opened the first store, built the first house,  the first school, the first tomato farm and the first packing house.  Home opened the first hotel in the area, today known as the  Redland Hotel at 5 South Flagler Avenue. It was built in 1913-  Homestead in the 30's, looking sou  /*/*. 		image/tiff						79276605 Bytes	4809	5495	4044614591	RGB	8	600	asm02500000560004001.tif		2013-08-08	2013-08-08	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/20	20	21.jp2	/pamphlets/image/21.jp2

The City is revitalizing the downtown area with new  landscaping, improved drainage and new paved surfaces. Based  on the same pride, dedication, enthusiasm and foresight set  forth by Homestead's founding fathers, the new downtown revitali-  zation will revive the city's  hometown traditions.  South of Homestead on Krome  Avenue is the  Florida Pioneer  Museum, located  in Florida City.  Built in 1904 it  is among the earliest  remaining buildings in  Dade County associated  with the beginnings of  the railroad.  Vine-ripened tomatoes  are a cash crop in Homestead.  North of the city is the "Redland" farm country, where farmers grow tomatoes, limes, mangos and avocados. Today, 95% of  the limes and mangos, along with 25% of all the avocados produced in the United States, come from Dade County. The area produces much of the nation's winter vegetables, earning it the nick  name of the nation's "Winter Salad Bowl."

Anderson's Corner has been  restored, and now houses  a restaurant and gallery.  Originally known as Colored Town, this is the first black community in the city of Miami. When Miami was incorporated in 1896, an  area to the northwest of the city limits was set aside for blacks,  who at the time constituted  a significant part of the  work force for the new city.  Construction of the  railroad, hotels, roads and  housing provided a major  source of work, and blacks,  mainly from the South  and the Bahamas, were attracted to and settled in the  area. Colored Town flourished as a strong, self-sufficient community, with its own businesses,  shops, churches, schools and places of entertainment.  Through the 1940s and 1950s Overtown became well known  for its jazz clubs, where nationally prominent black entertainers  performed. Artists such as Billie Holiday, Nat King Cole, Louis  Armstrong and Lena Home frequented hotels and clubs like the  Mary Elizabeth and the Lord Calvert. Northwest Second Avenue  became known as "Little Broadway."  The last three decades have taken their toll on Overtown.  Two major expressways built during the 1960s tore right through  the heart of the community, fragmenting it into small, disjointed  The Carver and Mary Elizabeth Hotels were  among the most popular 40's and 50's nightspots.  pieces. Older buildings decayed and were demolished.  Many residents moved out  to new outlying areas.  Racial tensions gave way  to civil disturbances in 1980,  which deeply scarred what  remained of this once thriving neighborhood.  St. John Baptist Church is  a cornerstone of the  Overtown community.  New plans for redevelopment and revitalization of Overtown  are currently under way. Housing, shops and hotels once again will  bring the area back to its earlier pulse. A proposed Historic  Overtown Folklife Village will reuse existing historic buildings in a  re-creation of earlier times. As the neighborhood changes and  plans for its revitalization evolve, one thing remains - the identity  of local black residents with the spirit and vitality of Overtown in  earlier years.

George  Merrick's "City Beautiful" was a totally planned community.  Included were residential and commercial areas, along with entrances, gates, fountains  and plazas all in a  Spanish style. There  were areas dedicated to  schools and churches  and to sporting facilities.  Even now the initial  intentions of Merrick's  dream can be seen realized, in spite of the damages the development  suffered during the stock  market crash years.  The former home of the Merrick family,  built in 1907, is now open to the public.  Enough of the city was developed during its early years to  have left a positive imprint which continues today. It is, in fact,  the old world ambiance of the city planned in a Spanish Mediterranean theme that continues to serve as the main point of attraction of Coral Gables.  Most of the early monuments remain in fairly intact condition. Some of the early public and commercial buildings, such as  the Douglas Entrance  on S.W 8 Street and 37  Avenue, and the Florida National Bank on  Miracle Mile, are a  part of large-scale  expansions that  not only preserve  the original architecture, but actually  employ the same vocab  ulary in the modern  additions. The residential areas retain  not only their character, but their high  real estate value, a sign of the desirability  of the area and of the continued appeal of  the old-style atmosphere of its streets.  A beauty pageant held in 1929  at the Biltmore Hotel pool.  ■'^i-   i ■*.,&lt;,  The magnificent Biltmore Hotel  has been renovated to its  former glory as the architectural  centerpiece of Coral Gables.  City Hall at the foot  of Miracle Mile is among  the showplace buildings  to see. Coral Way and its  surrounding streets are  among the most beautiful  residential sections in  Dade County. Coral Gables House, located in the heart of the residential area of Coral Way, is another of the many attractions of the  city. Built in 1907 as the home of the Merrick family, it is open to  the public as a house museum. Exhibits include original furnishings  and memorabilia from the Merrick  family. The Biltmore Hotel on  Anastasia has undergone a $38  million rehabilitation returning it  to its glory as a luxury hotel.  Of particular interest is a  series of small neighborhoods  with special architectural themes  that were planned and designed  as part of the original city. The  Villages, as they are called,  were intended to give potential buyers even more  alternatives in "atmospheric" neighborhoods  than those already offered  by the main Spanish Mediterranean theme. These residential areas include the French  Country, French Provincial, French City, Dutch South African,  Colonial and Chinese Villages.

There was a small  commercial dock at N.E. 6lst Street and Biscayne Bay. With a small  hotel, several businesses and  close to a hundred homes,  the area was one of Dade's  first organized communities.  Unfortunately, the pioneer  settlement has almost completely disappeared.  First arriving in significant numbers in 1980,  Haitians began moving into  the area roughly bounded by  Many shops and homes are adorned  in brilliant Haitian colors.  Biscayne Boulevard on the east, 1-95 on the west, the Design  District (46 Street) on the south and the 79th Street Causeway  on the north.  Today the area has become "Little Haiti."  Haitian merchants have opened shops catering  to their fellow countrymen along 54th Street.  In a two-block demonstration area, from  Miami Avenue to N.E. 2nd Avenue, local  merchants have painted their stores in  the brilliant hues reminiscent of the colorful homes in Haiti. Restaurants along the  street serve up Creole cooking and imported beverages.  Tasty Creole cooking is served up  in Little Haiti restaurants.  In the spring the area's people celebrate their roots with the "Haitian History  Carnival," a colorful street parade with  island bands and folkloric performances.  Dr. Dupuis' Drugstore at the corner  of N.E. 2 Avenue and 62 Street, built in 1902,  is among the earliest remaining structures  from the settlement of Lemon City.

This excess water often  impedes the flow of traffic.  This bond issue would provide $5 million each year  for the next six years to fund storm sewer construction.  The first storm sewers will be constructed in areas with  the most serious flooding problems, including that part  of Miami west of Lejeune Road.  These bonds would provide for:  -The elimination of severe or prolonged flooding on city  streets.  The promotion of the safety and welfare of city  residents and commuters.

S. Coast Guard seaplane base. We approach  the greatest of all international airway systems, the Pan-  American, with airlanes extending thousands of miles  between Central and South America, Europe, Asia, and  many other foreign lands. Miami's proximity to South  America has fostered the growth of a large Latin American colony, and made her an important center for Pan-  American relations. It is a sight worth while to see these  great airliners sailing gracefully through the air and  gliding down to the peaceful waters of Bay Biscayne,  terminating at Miami. This thrilling experience is all  the more striking when seen from the observation deck  of the Yacht "Dixie".  CAPE FLORIDA  Leaving the mainland and Miami in the background, crossing the bay at its widest point, our cruise  now takes us to Cape Florida—a section rich in romance  and historic atmosphere. A former pirate stronghold,  dating back to the Spanish main. We follow the route  of Ponce de Leon along the inland coast of Biscayne  Bay. You will marvel at the colorful scenery and sparkling beauty of the crystal-clear water, dotted with islands  and keys, enchanting and alluring. Standing like a sentinel and towering majestically before us, at the extreme  southern tip of Biscayne Key we sight the ancient lighthouse of historic fame, the scene of many naval battles  and Indian massacre. At this historic spot many ships  came to grief. This is a sight never to be forgotten, also  a famous landmark that can only be seen by boat. A  good view of the broad Atlantic can be had from this  point.  A.   G.   H.   LINES  COCONUT PLANTATION  Leaving Cape Florida, we continue North, following  the inland route adjacent to the Florida Keys, cruising  the opposite shore of Bay Biscayne. We complete our  tour by showing many uninhabited islands, covered with  dense tropical growth and mangrove swamps. As we  wend our way homeward, we view the Matheson Morro-  can Castle and coconut plantation. Here are seen hundreds of coconut palms growing in their natural state.  Virginia Key and Bears Cut are a few of the interesting  sights that are included on the return.  Insist upon the Yacht "Dixie" the boat that has a  character all its own, a unique air of southern hospitality  and an unmistakable feeling of friendly interest in the  enjoyment and comfort of every passenger.

Metropolitan Miami has had a meteoric rise, unparalleled in civic growth, and offers a full variety of  social and recreational advantages. Here in the metropolis of the tropics one may find a thousand and one  diversions.  Perhaps you are paying Miami your first visit.  Might we, therefore, remind you that while here, you  are in the same latitude as Egypt? While you enjoy  the scenic beauty, the gorgeous tropical skies and profit  by our healthful summer atmosphere, you are almost  perpetually fanned by pleasant breezes, wafted to you  by the trade winds which are tempered by the marvelous  effect of the Gulf Stream. Books have been written, pictures painted and people in every walk of life have  attempted to describe Miami, but to know Miami is to  see Miami, and to this end we beg to help you.  The A. G. H. Lines of Miami, take pride in presenting a trip that is truly different. A three-hour continuous circle cruise of Bay Biscayne and Florida Keys,  the only trip of this nature operating in Miami, and  considered the most beautiful inland scenic cruise ever  offered to visitors of the Magic City. A trip that conveys a vivid picture of Florida in pioneer days, a land  that has been through turbulent times while under the  flags of five nations, and whose original inhabitants  were the Tegesta, Culusa, and Seminole Indians; a land  of song, poetry and romance, reminiscent of days of  bitter memories, and heroic deeds.  THIS cruise will show the Miami area as it is today and  as it was before the coming of the white man; a  cruise not only of modern life, but one of ancient facts  and historic scenes: a personally conducted cruise that is  interesting, educational and authentic. Before we invite  you to cruise this tropical paradise, may we be permitted to say a word about our organization.  The Yacht "Dixie" is operated by and under the  personal supervision of the oldest and, in fact, the premier sightseeing men of Miami. Pioneers in the field,  with 25 years of sightseeing experience. Each and every  trip has been scientifically planned and operated for  the purpose of familiarizing the visitor and stranger  with the principal points of interest in the Miami area.  506^^^^^  *r-/y~&7  ITINERARY  Leaving the City Yacht Basin, our trip begins with  a good view of Miami's magnificent skyline, Bayfront  Park, Rock Gardens, and Band Shell. The Yacht "Dixie"  points her bow to the south, preparatory to a cruise of  the Florida Keys and historic Cape Florida. Passing the  Miami River,, we enter Burlingame Channel, a Venicelike waterway that flows between Brickell Point and  Burlingame Island. Surrounded by the waters of Bay  Biscayne, thickly populated with hundreds of Australian  pines, within easy reach of the mainland, this island  will soon become a part of Miami's exclusive residential  colony. Formed by sand pumped from the Bay bottom,  this marvelous exhibition of landscape architecture, is  one of Miami's great achievements.  BRICKELL POINT  On the opposite side of the channel, nestled among  the palms, amidst a tropical setting, we view Brickell  Point and the old Brickell homestead, a land-mark to  Miami, formerly the site of an Indian trading post, and  for many years the home of the late Wm. Brickell, a  pioneer, prominent in the early development of Miami.  MILLIONAIRES' ROW  Facing the Bay, and south of Brickell Point, we  next approach Point View, Miami's exclusive residential section. Here a scenic splendor unrivalled elsewhere awaits the visitor. A cluster of magnificent homes  and estates, occupied by many world celebrities and  nationally-known business men. Famous for its dignified charm and beauty, Point View is considered the  most pretentious residential section in Florida, and can  be fully appreciated when seen from off shore. The  following are a few of the palatial homes and estates  that we pass and view, enroute:  PAGE  JOYCE  LUDEN  BISSEL  KINCAID  BRISBANE  BIRDSEY  WADE  ELSER  STALEY  ESTILL  GUTHRIE  BABCOCK  FREELAND  MOON  ROMPH  ROGERS  GREGOR  JACKSON  GILLMAN  DE-WEESE  DEERING ESTATE  Villa Viscaya, the world-famous home of the late  James Deering, is a part of metropolitan Miami which  is sought by all well informed visitors. Since the death  of Mr. Deering the estate has been closed to the public.  This beautiful mansion can only be seen by boat. Due  to the shallow draft of the Yacht "Dixie", it is now  possible to obtain a close-up view, as we bring you  within a few feet of the estate. This pretentious home  bears the reputation of being the most magnificent residence in the U. S. Mr. Deering expended many millions  of dollars on the home and grounds, employing the  world's best architects and materials in its construction,  and is universally accorded first rank among America's  finest estates. To miss a view of this tropical paradise is  to miss seeing one of the wonder spots of the South.  COCONUT GROVE  We next approach Coconut Grove (an old Spanish  seaport), one of the earliest settlements on the shore of  Bay Biscayne. This tropical beauty spot is further enhanced by many of Miami's most attractive estates. It  offers a display of gorgeously colored foliage, shrubbery  and palms, which blended with the wonderfully designed  homes adjoining this section, make it one of the most  popular cruise features. We pass and view Villa Serena,  the former home of the late Wm. Jennings Bryan. In  this enchanting spot the Great Commoner worked and  left many of his most famous writings. Here the guide  explains the surrounding landscape—each and every  point of interest is fully described, the lecture service is  delivered in distinct and correct English, and contains  no offensive remarks.  jT.,£a SV*« & &gt;&lt;** *******%&«*#%0*%*J  RISCAYNE   RAY   •   RESIDENTIAL   •   HISTORICAL      CIRCLE      CRUISE 		image/tiff						155814756 Bytes	9558	5434	1256637680	RGB	8	600	asm02500000040002001.tif		2013-08-08	2013-08-08	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/59	59	60.jp2	/pamphlets/image/60.jp2

Construction began during the reign of  Alphonso VII, King of Leon and Castile. The  Monastery and its Cloisters were originally  dedicated in honor of the Blessed Mother, and  were named the "Monastery of Our Lady",  Queen of Angels."  Upon the canonization of the famous Cistercian Monk, Bernard of Clairvaux - a leading  influence in the Church during that period - the  Monastery was renamed in his honor.  Cistercian Monks occupied the Monastery  for nearly 700 years. Then, during a social  revolution in that area in the mid-1830's, the  buildings and grounds were seized and sold,  and the Cloisters were converted into a granary  and stable.  In 1925, the grand collector, William  Randolph Hearst purchased the Cloisters and  the Monastery's outbuildings for $500,000.  Hearst planned to reconstruct them on his  San Simeon Estate in California, where, it was  rumored, he intended to use the Cloisters to  surround a swimming pool. Stone by stone the  structures were dismantled, bound with protective hay, packed in some 11,000 wooden  crates, numbered for identification, and  shipped to the United States.  Fate intervened, however. Hoof and mouth  disease had broken out in Segovia, and the U.S.  Department of Agriculture, fearing possible  contagion, quarantined the shipment upon its  arrival. The crates were broken open and the  protective hay, a possible carrier of the disease,  was burned. Unfortunately, the workmen failed  to replace the stones in the same numbered  boxes before moving them to a warehouse -  and, so began The Sage of "The World's  Largest and Most Expensive Jigsaw Puzzle."  Shortly after the shipment arrived, Hearst  began having financial problems, and much of  his collection was sold at auction. The stones  remained in a warehouse in Brooklyn, New  York for 26 years. Then, in 1952, one year after  Hearst's death they were purchased by Messrs  W. Edgemon and R. Moss for use as a tourist  attraction and were brought to this site. It took  19 months and around one-and-a-half million  dollars to put the puzzle together. Some of the  unmatched stones still remain in the back lot,  others were used in the construction of the  present Church's Parish Hall.  The Cloisters are an example of early Gothic  architecture. Although an attempt was made to  present the buildings exactly as they were in  Spain, several things are different. For example,  the floors of the Cloisters in Segovia were  covered with small rocks. In reconstruction,  Cuban tile replaced the stones. Nor are the  Corbels that hang in the Cloisters from the  original building. A part of the Hearst Art  Collection, the Corbels were placed here because they represent the same Noble houses that  supported the Church and the King in that  Province during the same period the Monastery  was built.  In 1964 the Cloisters were purchased from  North Miami Beach by the Episcopal Diocese  of South Florida. During the Bishopric of The  Rt. Rev. James Duncan, the first Bishop of the  Episcopal Diocese of Southeast Florida, Col.  Robert Pentland, a benefactor of many Episcopal Churches, purchased the Cloisters and  presented them to the young parish, St. Bernard  de Clairvaux. A Parish Hall, named after  Bishop Henry Louttit, was also built at  that time.  V  Notes On  Artifacts & Structures  Sixteenth Century Cabinet  From the Ortega Family of Barcelona, this  cabinet is said to have been painted by a student of Rafael. The oil-on-copper paintings  have never been retouched. The cabinet stored  religious articles.  Chasuble  This Chasuble, the outer garment worn by a Priest  during the Celebration of the Mass, is more than 150  years old. It was made by the women of the  Cathedral in Barcelona.  Book  The book displayed on the showcase is the record of the  Court Trial of the De Soto Family. The trial was held to  prove that the De Sotos were of Royal Blood, therefore,  were exempt from paying taxes.  Hymnarium  This book was hand-painted on lambskin parchment;  juices of berries were used as ink.  Pope's Cabinet  This hand-carved, walnut cabinet was used by Pope Urban  VII (1623-1644) to store his vestments. It is decorated with  the Papal Seal and Bees - a family crest.  Exit to the Patio  This is the original iron gate that was set in front of the  walls leading into the Monastery. It is hand-wrought and  weighs over 200 pounds.  The Garden Walk  I      This site was nursery before the Monastery was recon-  1      structed here, and nearly 1,000 plants and trees of various  types still remain. The statues here were donated to the  I      Church in the 1970's,  •    Abbot's Chair  |      Located across the driveway, at the far left end of the  j     formal gardens, as you approach the entrance of the  Cloisters.  Enter the Cloisters   Turning left, note..,  The Corbels  Ten Corbels hang along two halls of the Cloisters. They  represent the shields of the Noble and Royal families who  supported the Church and King during the time the  Monastery was constructed.

Q  tii  0.  u $  Bn]E  5 = 1  TRINITY TODAY  The Cathedral today continues its historic ministry  with worship, fellowship, education and outreach to  the community at its heart.  Sunday worship is at 8, 9 and 11 a.m. with education  classes for persons of all ages following the 9 o'clock  service. Child care is also offered at this service.  Services are held on weekdays at Noon from  September through May.  The Cathedral Book Store and Gift Shop is located in  the Cathedral Hall. Staffed by volunteers, the store is  open weekdays from 10 until 4, and on Sundays after  services.  Our Thrift Shop is located at 8363 N.E. 2nd Avenue.  Your contributions of clothing, kitchenware, jewelry,  and bric-a-brac are tax deductible. Used toys also find a  ready outlet in a neighborhood where residents  appreciate items that are clean and in good repair at  low cost.  The Thrift Shop is open Tuesdays, Thursdays and  Saturdays from 9 until 3 p.m.  LOCATION  The Cathedral stands in the center of The Omni, Plaza  Venetia and the Marriott on Biscayne Bay at North  Bayshore Drive at Sixteenth Street.  If you are driving, exit 1-95 at N.E. 2nd Avenue and  1 lth Street at the Howard Johnson motor inn, turn  North on Biscayne Boulevard (US 1) to 15th Street,  turn right and the Cathedral parking area entrance is  immediately before the Plaza Venetia building. Should  that be full, please park in The Omni garage.  U  PASTORAL SERVICES  The Cathedral clergy are available for counseling and  pastoral administrations during regular office hours and  at night for emergencies.  Baptism: A person becomes a Christian at Baptism.  This ancient practice commanded by Christ as  necessary for salvation brings us into the full  fellowship of his Body, the Church. At the Cathedral,  Holy Baptism is administered on the First Sunday  after the Epiphany, Easter Day, the Day of Pentecost,  and on All Saints' Sunday. Baptisms are celebrated at  regularly scheduled services on Sundays when the  congregation can witness and welcome the  candidates.  Confirmation: The canon law of the Episcopal  Church expects its members to confirm their  Baptismal vows after receiving appropriate instruction  in theology, history and Holy Scriptures. Our sixth  grade Sunday School class gives this instruction to  young people. Adults are invited to attend the Dean's  classes on the six Saturday mornings of the Lenten  season.  The Holy Eucharist: All Baptized persons are  welcome to receive the Sacramanet of Holy  Communion in the Episcopal Church. It is our  privilege to bring the Sacrament to sick and shut-ins  at their request.  Marriage: We consider Holy Matrimony a solemn  and public covenant between man and wife in the  presence of God. In this rite, the man and woman are  the Sacrament (the outward and visible forms). The  Church witnesses and blesses the marriage. Because  of the large number of persons who would use the  Cathedral for their marriage without concern for its  life of worship and fellowship, we limit marriage  services to members of the Cathedral in Good  Standing.  Reconciliation of a Penitent: Private Confession is  offered to penitents whose consciences suffer from  the gravity of sin and who need the counsel as well  as the absolution of God given by a priest usually at  the altar rail and always in absolute confidence.  Burial of the Dead: The liturgy for the dead is an  Easter liturgy. It finds its meaning in the Resurrection  from the death of Jesus Christ. Christian burial  takes place in the church unless otherwise  determined by the officiant and the family.

When the present • and third • Trinity Church,  designed by Harold Hastings Mundy, was built in 1925,  its seventy-foot nave surmounted by the cross,  dominated the skyline of Miami's Miramar section.  Today, at first glance, the Cathedral may seem  dwarfed by the highrise buildings that surround it. Yet,  the building remains its own witness to spiritual  values in the heart of a new hotel and shopping area - a  place for contemplation, worship and community  service.  Cathedrals have been called "God's Working-  spaces," not only for the yearly round Christian  celebrations, but for national and local events that  affect persons of all faiths. One may find a Kirkin'  O' The Tartan ceremony for the Scot's community or  the observance of Jamaican Independence Day  incorporated into the Cathedral's life.  They also serve their historic function of "sanctuary,"  which in today's world often means an open forum  where controversial issues can be explored. They are  centers for education and the Cathedral Book Store  augments the instruction offered in classes on  Sunday mornings. Another historic roll of cathedrals  is to be patrons of the arts and here at Trinity, exhibits,  recitals, concerts, drama and dance are presented  regularly without charge.  Trinity Cathedral, Miami, serves as the Mother Church  for 38,000 Episcopalians from Jensen Beach to  Key West and from Martin County to the Atlantic Ocean.  Diocesan services for ordinations, youth events,  conventions; meeting rooms for various boards and  committees of Diocesan life, are all part of the  cathedral's function.  You may find the Cathedral Hall being used as a  precinct poll for the neighborhood or a stack of  "twice-around" clothing piled in a corner waiting to be  taken to our Thrift Shop, or a line of destitute persons  asking for food and assistance. Each of these programs  is important in itsef and together they make-up the  myriad activities which find their origin and support  from the worship offered by its members and friends.  HISTORY  It is a celebrated fact that Miami's future was secured  when Julia Tuttle invited Henry Flagler to extend his  railroad from Palm Beach to Miami. The future of the  Episcopal Church in Miami was also determined when  Mrs. Tuttle invited the Bishop of the Missionary  Jurisdiction of Southern Florida to come to Miami as her  guest.  Bishop William Crane Gray celebrated the Holy  Eucharist in Mrs. Tuttle's home on the Miami River  in 1893. Three years later the congregation was  organized and Mrs. Tuttle gave the land for the first  church building, a simple, frame structure, with  cheesecloth that could be hastily placed over the  windows when the wind from the Everglades brought  the mosquitos.  The first church was replaced with a monstrous  concrete structure in 1911 on the same site which is now  know as Northeast Second Avenue at Second Street.  The congregation's increasing impatience with noise  and congestion combined with the Florida Land Boom.  Money seemed plentiful and endless and caught-up in  that expansive spirit the congregation constructed  the present church with cathedral-like  proportions to serve tourists from the North and  a resident Episcopalian population of some  three hundred.  The Great Depression, a catastrophic hurricane  and the loss of tourists from the North left the local  congregation with an enormous indebtedness which  was not satisfied until June of 1946. A new education  building was constructed in 1957, and in the Sixties  there were funds for much-needed repairs and the  decoration of the interior.  On Easter Day 1970, the Bishop of the newly-created  Diocese of Southeast Florida proclaimed Trinity  Church, Miami, the Cathedral and the destiny of this  large and beautiful edifice was assured.  Listed on the National Register of Historic Places  October 10, 1980.  ARCHITECTURE AND DECORATION  Three classic styles of art and architecture combine  to give this Cathedral its unique beauty. The over-all plan  is Romanesque Revival as seen in the width of the  spacious nave, the rounded arches and large window  openings. French Gothic stained glass and the mosaic  encrustments reminiscent of Byzantine churches create  a harmonious spirit of reverence as one enters the nave.  The glass on the southside with its foliated borders  tells the story of Christ's life beginning with the  Annunciation at the East end and concluding with the  Ascension and Kingship of Christ at the West. On the  Northside the glass commemorates the saints,  monarchs and scholars of the Church in England,  Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Above in the clerestory,  the stanzas of an ancient hymn from the Old Testament  occupy the center lancets and the miracles and  parables of Jesus are set forth on either side.  The spandrel mosaics bridging the fourteen arches  picture the Way of the Cross from the time Pilate  washes his hands of responsibility until the Body of  Jesus is entombed in the garden. The encrustments on  the triumphal arch over the altar remind us of the six  days of Creation in the oblong panels and the  biblical symbols of the Four Evangelists in the circles.  The most striking mosaic is in the apse with a sunburst  of light and the angels and archangels on either side  suggesting "The heavens and all the powers therein."  The pipe organ built by Ernest M. Skinner Company  was installed when the church was completed in 1925.  Since then its original 35 ranks of pipes have been  expanded to insure tones suitable for playing organ  music from all periods of history, the Baroque as well  as the Romantic.  There is much to see and much to learn as one  explores the symbolism in glass, stone castings and  mosaics. Decoration even extends to the wooden screen  covering the organ chambers with its fishtail design  recalling the earliest symbol of Christian life, the  Greek word for fish IXTHCJS an acronym for "Jesus -  Christ - Son of God."

The vast building is severe and  almost fortress-like in its exterior but built around an open  central court planted with exotic palms and rare tropical  plants. The great rooms on the main floor include a noble Renaissance Hall and a Dining Hall which reflect the spirit and  style of the 16th century. Along with these are sumptuous,  but gay and lovely rooms entirely built and furnished in the  spirit of the Roccoco. Doors, mantelpieces, panelled rooms  and chandeliers from great French and Italian palaces form  a background for the superb collection of furniture, decorations and carpets which can be equalled no place in America  and few places in Europe. The house is a great museum of the  decorative arts of Europe and provides a unique opportunity  to know and to study the various styles of the 16th, 17th and  18th centuries as they can be seen only in the great private  houses of France and Italy.  THE GARDENS—The great formal gardens are unique on  this continent as a large scale creation in the Italian spirit.  They are conceived  as architecture,  a vast outdoor living-  room enclosed by hedges and walls, combining the green of  trees and clipped shrubs with statues, stately urns and shady  grottos. As in Italy fountains and pools play an essential part  in the garden design and one is never far from the sound of  splashing water  or the sight of reflections on a quiet pool.  The main vista from the house looks toward a graceful and  airy casino built as the crowning feature of the mound  which is reached along a water stairs. On this eminence cool  shade is provided by huge live oaks. From there one is led  down  again  to  the Fountain  Garden,  a large  circular area  crossed by canals fed by jets of water and having as its central  feature  an   impressive  Baroque  fountain  brought  from   an  /   "X    Italian town near Rome. Other features of the gardens are a tiny  I        \ verdure theater, a tropical grotto and the impressive seawall  J 5   1 which reaches out to a latticed pavillion on one hand and a  I u«   I yacht landing on the other. The harbor is protected by a break-  V   J   water in the form of a great stone barge. The approach to the  House and Gardens is through a rich tropical woods, the finest  Florida hammock still preserved within the City of Miami.  gP    . *j „c-%     Aerial View of VIZCAYA Taken From Over Biscayne Bay  18th Century Wall Paintings and Furniture in the Tea Room  Above is a glimpse of the stately Tea  Room with wall paintings made in Naples  in the 18th century telling the story of the  sack of Troy.

Lights play on  fountains and statues of mythological demigods. The  Great House glows in its setting on the shore of Biscayne  Bay. And the dark semitropical jungle that surrounds  villa and gardens give them an added sparkle.  Sound and Light at Vizcaya opens this almost unbelievable  beauty to everyone.  Modelled after the son et lumiere presentation at the Valley  of the Kings in Luxor on Egypt's upper Nile, Sound and  Light at Vizcaya includes with all its beauty the fascinating  story of the Italian Renaissance-style villa. Backed by  music appropriate to a palazzo, special lighting highlights  the narrative and the music.  Sound and Light at Vizcaya is a music and fine art experience unique in America. Reservations are required  of this very special event.  Classical Gods and Goddesses flank the sculpture  walks in Vizcaya's Gardens.  fc*^*!!!*  The salon of the Deering suite-an Empire setting worthy  of Napoleon.  The opulence of a bygone era in turn-of-the-century  America comes alive once more in Villa Vizcaya and its  stunningly beautiful formal gardens. Once the winter  home of James Deering, a founder of International  Harvester Company, the mansion was inspired by the  great villas of Renaissance Italy.  Inside the mansion, described as "America's most  beautiful home," are rare antiques -\ furniture,  tapestries, Oriental rugs, architectural elements — dating  to 1st century Rome, to 15th century Spain and Italy and  later periods of Europe's past.  Outside lie 10 acres of formal gardens unmatched in the  Western world outside of Europe — unique in its subtropical adaption of the Italian hill garden and replete  with grottoes, pools, fountains and sculptures.

It was designed by A. Ten Eyck Brown and is  know for its ziggurat tower.  ©BURDINES  22 East Flagler Street  c. 1936   The current structure is built on the site of  an earlier Burdine's store (c. 1912) and is an example  of the Streamline Modern style. One of Miami's  most prosperous merchant families, the Burdines  opened a dry goods store in 1898 which quickly  became a thriving business.  © GESU CHURCH/RECTORY  130 N.E. 2nd Street  c. 1921-1925   These structures are on the National  Register of Historic Places and are excellent in craftsmanship and detailing such as the colossal arches  and tower of the church, and the finely detailed facade  of the rectory.  U.S. POST OFFICE  300 N.E. 1st Avenue  c. 1931    This important Neo-Classical building was  designed by Phineas & Paist and built in oolitic limestone mined in the Florida Keys. Denman Fink,  designer of Venetian pool, painted the central courtroom mural, depicting Miami's history. The building is  listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  ©SEYBOLD BUILDING  36 N.E. 1st Street  c. 1921    The original two-story arcade was enlarged  to a ten-story building in 1925, by the architects of  El Jardin (Carrollton School). Mr. Seybold had been a  prominent Miami merchant and baker since 1896.  © AMERIFIRST BUILDING  100 N.E. 1st Avenue  c. 1913   Originally the U.S. Post Office, the building  adapts the Neo-Classical style of Florida's subtropical  climate.  ©DADE COMMONWEALTH BUILDING  139 N.E. 1st Street  c. 1925   Built during the peak of Miami's real estate  boom, this building lost the top eight floors in the great  1926 hurricane. It was one of the first steel frame high  rises to house an elevator.  ©CAPITAL BUILDING  117 N.E. 1st Avenue  c. 1926   Once one of Miami's tallest buildings, the  structure displays the only French Second Empire  styled mansard roof in downtown Miami. The  roof is copper-faced and edged with a richly  detailed parapet.  ©HAHN BUILDING  140 N.E. 1st Avenue  c. 1921 Designed by one of Miami's most popular  architects, George L. Pfeiffer, the structure is in the  Mediterranean Revival style.  A U 11 -&lt; III 11 WtLNNG TOUR Cf DOWNTOWN  © COLON HOTEL  229 N.E. 2nd Avenue  c. 1914   Like the Toledo Hotel, this Mediterranean-  influenced building is a typical example of Miami  period architecture.  © METROPOLITAN BUILDING  213 N.E. 2nd Avenue  c. 1921   The arabesque lintels and tiled parapet  are a few of the remaining Mediterranean Revival  details which originally characterized this  renovated structure.  W'i© FRANK'S RESTAURANT  138 N.E. 2nd Avenue  c. 1921    Finely detailed in the Mediterranean idiom,  the second floor preserves the original ornamentation. The first floor has been altered greatly.  © CONGRESS BUILDING  111 N.E. 2nd Avenue  c. 1923   A fine example of Mediterranean Revival  architecture, the structure is noteworthy for both its  size and handsome ornamentation.  ©ALFRED I. DUPONTBUILDING  169 East Flagler Street  c. 1939   One of Miami's finest example of Depression Moderne architecture, the building uses a  restrained Art Deco vocabulary.  \ © WALGREENS  200 East Flagler Street  c. 1937   A noteworthy example of Streamline  Moderne architecture, stylistic features include the  horizontal banding across the facade.  © MAURICE GUSMAN CULTURAL CENTER  174 East Flagler Street  c. 1925   Formerly the Olympia Theatre, the building  was built by America's foremost atmospheric theatre  designer. It was also Miami's first airconditioned  building. Of interest are the original Wurlitzer organ,  illusionistic interior and Rococo cherubic statuary.  This Mediterranean Revival structure is listed on the  National Register of Historic Places.   ©INGRAHAM BUILDING  25 S.E. 2nd Avenue  c. 1926   Virtually unaltered, this Second Renaissance Revival structure housed the real estate  division of Henry Flagler's Florida East Coast  Railway. The first floor lobby features a hand-painted  ceiling and bronze elevator doors as well as a  bronze mailbox.  ® HUNTINGTON BUILDING  168 S.E. 1st Street  c. 1926   Although it had undergone extensive  renovation, the building retains one of Miami's most  interesting rooflines due to the sculptured busts  along the parapet. It was built by Miami developer  Frederick Rand during the great real estate boom.  /^Sr&gt;**%{pL T& ■ 		image/tiff						201510006 Bytes	10119	6638	1638271794	RGB	8	600	asm02500000090002001.tif		2013-08-08	2013-08-08	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/95	95	96.jp2	/pamphlets/image/96.jp2

Dade Heritage Days is  greater Miami's forum for the contributions made in the  past that helped shape our present community. It is a time  to highlight individual heritages — who you are, where  you come from, and what you do to help create a better  Miami. Pioneers from our multi-ethnic communities share  their remembrances of what Miami used to be and how  they have seen it change. Dade Heritage Days is an  exploration of our rich historical past — a celebration — a  time to build commonalty from diversity, through understanding.  Dade Heritage Trust  In 1972, a group of area citizens realized that precious  few resources remained of Miami's early history. This  small but stalwart group is responsible for organizing  Dade Heritage Trust to begin safeguarding Dade County's  most important historic buildings.  Today, Dade Heritage Trust is the county's largest  historic preservation organization. As a not-for-profit  organization, the Trust works with preservationists  throughout Dade County to foster the preservation of the  historic environment and to promote a better understanding of its heritage. Membership is open to everyone  interested in saving our historic structures, neighborhoods, and districts. Becoming a member of Dade Heritage  Trust means you'll receive invitations to special events at  historic sites; Dade Heritage Trust News, a quarterly  newsletter; PRESERVATION TODAY, a preservation journal  and, most importantly, you'll be supporting the voice of  preservation in the community. An active and informed  membership helps to sustain preservation efforts in Dade  County, the Trust's position in the community and its  administrative and promotional operations. To join Dade  Heritage Trust, call 358-9572.  1989 Dade Heritage Days  Schedule  April 7 - May 14  FRIDAY, APRIL 7  7 PM - TROPICAL AUDUBON SOCIETY: Open House and  Reception.

Likewise, not more than 5 days annually register  more than 95 degrees. The daily range of temperatures is  very small, an average of only 11.8 degrees, and its average yearly range of mean monthly temperature is only  14.5. Thus, the principal cause of colds, one of labor's  principal causes of absenteeism—swift and drastic  changes of temperatures—is absent.  Comparisons of Miami and Boston show Miami's summers are as delightful as its winters. On June 21, Miami  has 2 hours and 16 minutes less sunshine than northern  cities; 2 hours and 16 minutes less to heat up and more  to cool off. On December 21, Miami has 2 hours and 1  minute more to heat up and less to cool off. The Gulf  Stream and steady trade winds also have powerful steadying effects on climatic conditions.  TEMPERATURE   RANGES   COMPARED  Highest and Lowest Temperatures are Mean  Annual Figures Over a 50 Year Period  (Chart reproduced from the book, "Miami,  Economic Pattern of a Resort Area," by Dr. E. P.  Wolff,  University  of  Miami  publication.)  UTILITIES  mHE FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY'S inter-  -*- connected system, numbering many large operating  plants covering most of south Florida, provides dependable power in any amount anywhere in its area.

The scores of enterprises recently established here have  secured needed labor quickly and without difficulty.  Miami's delightful living will always be an attraction to  whatever labor may be desired. Certain purely wartime  activities provide a pool of trained personnel already at  hand.  The area's world-renowned climate, pleasant and healthful throughout the year, not only lures labor but furnishes  a bonus in a happier, more active life. With food and rent  costs, educational and recreational facilities on a par or  better than in other industrialized sections, labor derives  a second bonus. Needing practically no heating fuel and  no heavy clothing, labor enjoys still another bonus. The  total result is that labor in any quantity and skills is  available without requiring extra inducements from management, and is healthier, happier and more efficient.  Manufacturers needing specially trained labor can have  potential employees taught in meritorious local vocational  schools under the direction of the employers' own foremen.  TRANSPORTATION  RAIL  WATER  A I R  MOT OR  mWO COMPETING RAILROADS, 8 airlines, 3 major  4- water transportation lines, 4 bus and several large  trucking outfits operating on the State's improved highway system, offer transportation fully adequate to handle  the industrial expansion of Greater Miami.  The Florida East Coast and the Seaboard Air Line Railways connect with other rail lines serving the entire nation  and provide speedy freight service wherever desired.  A chief inducement to industry is the superior, economical water transportation offered by Greater Miami. The  Clyde-Mallory, Merchants and Miners, and Bull Lines  operate out of Miami harbor to the more active East and  Gulf coast ports, Nassau and Havana.  Five other steamer lines, augmented by the availability  of "tramp" steamers serving all the world's ports, supply  convenient, cheaper contact with the Bahamas, West Indies, Latin America ,and wherever products are sold.  Eastern Air Lines, National Air Lines and Delta Air  Lines fly directly to most of the busier commercial centers in the eastern half of the country, and there connect  with air lines serving the western half. Five other air  lines, including the great Pan American Airways, provide expanding air express services to the great markets  lying to the South.  This service is supplemented in Winter by numbers of  private charter flight operators to all points of the nation.  STRATEGIC LOCATION  :'.',!'.",!.&gt; MARKETS  TyriAMI, served by 3 major and many auxiliary steamer  **■** lines and 6 inter-hemisphere air lines, is the nearest  U. S. port to the vast, expanding markets and rich rev  sources of the Caribbean countries and the southern  Americas.  Miami's retail and wholesale trade area covers more  than 14 counties in South Florida. The 1945 state census  gave these counties a combined permanent population of  656,907 persons, which includes none of the two million  annual winter visitors in the area. The 1945 state census  gives Dade county (Miami, county seat) a population of  315,138 actual technical count but an unofficial estimate of  400,000.  In 1929 Miami had 2,386 retail stores with annual sales  of $72,804,000 by 7,530 employees on a total payroll of  $8,447,000. By 1939 there were more than 3,030 stores  here with sales of $105,000,000 annually. War years have  shown comparative expansion. The 1946 estimate is 3,680  retail stores with annual volume of $123,000,000. The  1939 census also showed a total of 2,794 service establishments in the Miami trade area. This has passed the  3,500 mark.  From 244 establishments in 1929, Miami's wholesale  firms grew to a total of 382 by 1939, with sales pyramiding 51.6 percent. The 1946 estimate is 461.  Exceptional transportation facilities, both land and  water, make Miami's present and potential markets almost  illimitable in the United States. In water transportation  economies alone, Miami's position as the nearest U. S.  port to neighboring markets to the south give Miami  products an advantage over those originating at any other  U. S. Port.  HOME OF FAST GROWING FASHIONS  The Miami Fashion Council, 25 manufacturers  of women's tropical and sportswear and accessories has become internationally known in the  past two years through its consistent national  advertising. Besides increasing sales and production, the creation of the New Miami Market is  attracting other manufacturers of allied lines  interested in "getting in on the ground floor." The  council is a division of the Miami Chamber of  Commerce. Two fashion shows are held annually  for buyers.  &lt;®  NATURAL RESOURCES  RAW MATERIALS  SOUTHEASTERN Florida's fields and groves, including  famous Everglades, produce vast quantities of raw  materials offering magnetic processing possibilities. On  Miami's very doorstep are also nearly inexhaustible non-  metallic mineral resources. Add to these the golden raw  products 6*f Latin and Pan America, brought here by  cheap water transportation, and the prospective manufacturer who weighs Greater Miami's industrial potential  hears opportunity knocking loudly from many quarters.  Citrus and other fruits, sugar cane, lemon grass, byproducts of the beef-cattle raising industry, carbohydrates, vegetable processing, medicinal and fibrous  plants—these are just a few of the valuable agricultural  resources.  Fruits and vegetables offer opportunities for the processing of quick-frozen, dehydrated and canned products.  The chemurgic industry is showing an increasing interest  in cellulose derivatives. In the medicinal and condiment  fields, many basic ingredients now flourish in South  Florida, and many others, now imported at almost prohibitive costs, have been proven adaptable to growth in  this section.  Florida's richness in certain minerals is another industrial lure. The annual output of 3 types of phosphates—  land pebble, hard rock and soft—is around $12,000,000.  Kaolin, important in the making of chinaware, is available  in quantity. Much of the famous East Liverpool pottery  has been made from Florida kaolin.  South Florida has been called authoritatively a bulging,  almost untouched,  industrial  cornucopia.  WATER  lyri AMI'S municipal water system, with a present  *■"- capacity of 22,000,000 gallons a day, is geared for expansion if needed. The water comes from deep artisan  wells and is then softened and filtered, guaranteeing purity  as well as quantity.  MIAMI'S PORT OF ENTRY  LEADS ENTIRE NATION SINCE 1941  TYURING the 1945 fiscal year Miami's Port of Entry  ■^handled 33.23 percent of all civilian arrivals and departures to and from the United States.  Customs collections at Miami for the year 1945 totaled  $3,702,471.45. 		image/tiff						117795246 Bytes	7173	5474	4168796424	RGB	8	600	asm02500000070002001.tif		2013-08-08	2013-08-08	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/101	101	102.jp2	/pamphlets/image/102.jp2

Itfs just that, plain  ole gossip about travel,tours,transportation lines,  schedule changes, etc. with plenty of good honest  boosts for APGAR TRAVEL AGENCY thrown in,after all  that is the whold purpose of this little bulletin.  At  any rate we'll get this out to you about once a  month (or thereabouts). If you like it and find it  interesting - please pass it around or put it on  your bulletin board, and if youfd like more copies  just let us know, we111 be tickled to death to send  them to you.  Please don't hesitate to call us for answers to your  travel questions* All information and most of our  services are without cost or obligation to you.  Don't worry too much about imposing on us when you  ask for information or for some service that we don't  charge for. A little commission here, and a little  commission there and we manage to keep the wolf from breaking down the door.  Oh, I guess I forgot to tell you, we get a small commission on the things  you buy, tickets, hotel rooms and things like that. Now don't get the  wrong idea, you don't have to pay a penny extra for transportation, hotel  rooms or anything else you buy from us.  HOW ABOUT A CHANGE OF SCENERY  Now that we've got another season about ready for moth  balls here are a few ideas for QUICKIES, you know,little  vacations, a couple of days, a weekend, of if you can  spare it, a week. Sort of a pre-vacation preview.  HAVANA - There is always HAVANA. Not much of a place  to rest but quite a place, yes, quite a place. Lots  of ways to get there too. You can fly by Pan American,  National or Expreso Airways - just an hour and a half,  or a little less. Then too, there is the P & 0 Steamship Company's S.S.Florida for a more leisurely trip.  Leave Friday evening at 7 PM and return in time for  business Monday morning. Next time there is a full  moon how about getting up a party and making the trip  by boat. Even if you've been to HAVANA a hundred  times you're bound to enjoy this gdrgeous moonlight  sail.  If you are a first time visitor to HAVANA we'll  fix you up with an all expense tour that will show you  the best of HAVANA.  If you've been there before all you'll need will be  your ticket and a hotel reservation which we'll be pleased to furnish for  you. (remember our commission.)  NASSAU - Eighty minutes and thirty dollars from Miami by Pan American  Airways. If it is peace and quiet that appeals to you I can't think of  a better place to find it. Excellent hotels and food, good shopping too.  Don't forget to stay out of the country for at least 48 hours though if  you plan to buy much  0 [0  & 		image/tiff						101342586 Bytes	5089	6638	2189450834	RGB	8	600	asm02500000320002001.tif		2013-08-08	2013-08-08	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/107	107	108.jp2	/pamphlets/image/108.jp2

They haven't heard about Miami's tourist prices yet either.  Fly over on Eastern or Pan American Airway's big, luxurious DC 4's non  stop in just a few hours.  Fare is only $96.50 round trip.  Stay in  San Juan or visit Coamo Springs or cross the island by car to Ponce.  Wherever you go in Puerto Rico you'll find the people friendly and charming.  You'll have to make your hotel reservations-Well in advance though, cause,  like I say, they don't know about tourists yet. Hotels are excellent,  just not enough rooms. Might be a good idea to consider Puerto Rico for  your vacation this year too.  The climate is delightful all summer.  VACATIONS  Where is it going to be this summer? North Carolina  again? Well how about not waiting until everything  is full before you start trying to find a place to  stay, or train accommodations to get there. Lets get  those reservations made now while it is easy. Doesn't  cost any more to make them early, in fact, probably  quite some less.  If it is mountains you're pining for why not try those  to the south this summer,Mexico, Guatarnala,Jamaica,  Columbia.  Not far away by air and you'll sleep under  blankets at night. We've lots of information about  all of these places in our office. Why not ask for some?  CANADA - We had lots of folks from Canada visit us this  winter. Maybe some of us ought to return the visit this  summer. How about QUEBEC? Hard to find a nicer hotel  than the Frontenac located as it is right on top of the  bluff overlooking the City of Quebec and the St.Lawrence  River.  These French Canadian people can't do enough to make you comfortable  either.  Oh yes, you can get therety train, or plane, or just simply drive  your car there. We'll be happy to make all of your arrangements. ( You know,  Commissions again.)  JUST GOSSIP  Here is good news you cruise hungry people have  been waiting for - Delta Steamship Lines out of  Mobile announce a 53 day South American cruise,  all the way down to Buenos Aires.  Three new modern  cruise ships, ultra modern accommodations, not cheap  but probably worth the cost, full details including  pictures and itinerary at our office. (That's right,  more commissions.)  Don't get the idea from all this that you have to  take a big trip in order to do business with us,  tickets to Tampa, Palm Beach, Jacksonville, and  pdnts north add up too, and we're glad to have the  business.  Our only business is selling transportation and everything else we do is in the hope that  you will do more traveling and what is more important- buy your tickets from us. 		image/tiff						101342586 Bytes	5089	6638	4180510438	RGB	8	600	asm02500000320003001.tif		2013-08-08	2013-08-08	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/108	108	109.jp2	/pamphlets/image/109.jp2

We can probably get space  for you by boat or plane, that is, we can if you get started on it now.  If you belong to Clubs or such, and would like some travel movies to show  at meetings or social events, we can get some good ones and they're yours  for the asking.  Now is the time to take that long deferred air tour around South America.  Porter Norris, of Pan American Airways, was in to tell about the 10$ vacation discount Pan American is offering this summer - and this combines with  the lifting of the 15%  U. S. Transportation tax makes the cost of this trip  the lowest ever. We've a real surprise for you regarding this trip. Better  inquire.  (Hum, nice commission in this trip, too.;  Ken Hall of Delta Airlines was in today boasting about some extra good  service to Los Angeles through Ft. Worth. We called his bluff and darned  if he didn't produce the slickest connections you ever saw. Bing, right  through, Miami to Los Angeles with no delays at all.  That big new plane you've seen flying around is one of Eastern Airlines'  new Constellations. We hear it is soon going to be put in service to  New York.  EXECUTIVE EXPEDITING NEWS  Betcha a buck you didn't know we had such a department - and it's for, you business men - (the ones  too smart to waste your employees time by having  them buy your tickets and make your hotel reservations. You don't have to pay us for our time when  you have our office take care of the details for you.  Don't think that we can't get space for you as  well as you can get it yourself. Your buying power  is simply added to ours.  Have you ever had one of your employees get a  parking ticket while he was standing in line for  a ticket (transportation)?  We charge one third as much as the City and we  deliver the ticket (transportation, not parking,)  right to you.  A lot of you think we charge an extra fee for making the reservations and  securing your tickets, you're wrong, we sell for the same price as the  carriers themselves.  Those airline credit cards are good at our office now. You know, why not  get the habit of calling our office for your travel needs, you'll get better  service and save money too. Better tell your secretary and you're department heads too7.  Well, the end of the page - that's all it takes, a little persistence and  you're bound to run out of paper eventually.  Come on now, let's get those phones ringing - we like lots of inquiries,  they make us think we might make some money sometime. 		image/tiff						101342586 Bytes	5089	6638	4225055641	RGB	8	600	asm02500000320004001.tif		2013-08-08	2013-08-08	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/109	109	110.jp2	/pamphlets/image/110.jp2

Said to be the only frost-free  city in the United States, it is a delightful winter and health resort with a  subtropical climate and a semblance of the leisurely Latin approach to  everyday living.  For three centuries, its natural deep-water harbor was a mecca for  Indian canoes, Spanish galleons, pirate craft and sailing vessels of many  nations. In 1882, Commodore David Porter established a naval station  here as a base for operations against pirates in the Gulf of Mexico and  the Caribbean Sea. The final rout of the pirates opened the Keys to settlers,  most of whom came from Virginia, New England and the West Indies.  Since the time of the war with Mexico, Key West has had a military post  and naval station, and in every war has served as an important naval base.  Older Key West dwellings are predominantly one-and-a-half story  frame structures anchored deep in the native coral rock. Some of these  houses were built by ship carpenters who used pegs instead.of nails. Most  houses have slatted shutters which permit a free circulation of air and at  the same time eliminate the glare of the tropical sun.  Tropical trees, plants, fruits and flowers grow in variety and profusion  in Key West. Coconut and date palms are plentiful and among the fruits  that grow in abundance are Spanish limes, avocado pears and sugar  apples. There are also a few pomegranate and several bearing breadfruit  trees on the island.  Restaurants feature Cuban-American dishes, particularly sea food.  Among the unusual foods served are turtle steaks, conch chowder and  arroz con polio—chicken and yellow rice. Approximately 50 restaurants  and 2,000 hotel and motel rooms provide food and lodging for visitors to  the island.  Fishing, in addition to being a popular sport, is also important commercially. The annual shrimp catch alone is estimated at more than five  million dollars. Just beyond the turtle crawls on Margaret St. is the plant  where green turtle soup, for which Key West is famous, is made.  Among the points of interest in the city are the lighthouse, the southernmost point in the United States, and the Municipal Aquarium containing many  varieties of tropical fish and other marine life, found only in the waters off  the Keys and the West Indies.  ghway  Official U.

Seaquarium porpoises have been trained to raise flags and  jump through hoops, displaying remarkable intelligence.  In 26 corridor aquariums hundreds of highly colored, rare, tropical specimens  including many strange creatures, are individually exhibited. Because of  their small size they would be lost in the big tanks.  ■  The speedy porpoises vie with the larger specimens for food offered by  the diver. Six times daily their undersea dietitian makes sure that all  fishes, large and small, get their share of the food offered. More than  2000 fishes inhabit both huge tanks.  Spacious entrance to the main Seaquarium. Large glass windows on two  levels completely encircle each huge tank. In almost a million gallons of  sea water thousands of large and small creatures of the sea live as they  do in the open ocean.

He did his best, but got two stations at once, one of which  was broadcasting physical exercises and the other the recipe. This  is what he took down:  "Hands on hips, place one cup of flour on the shoulders, raise  knees and depress toes, and mix thoroughly in half a cup of milk.  Repeat six times. Inhale quickly one-half teaspoonful of baking  powder, lower the legs and mash two hard-boiled eggs in a sieve.  Exhale, breathe naturally, and sift into a bowl.  "Attention! Lie flat on the floor and roll the white of an egg  until it comes to a boil. In 10 minutes remove from the fire and  rub smartly with a rough towel. Breathe naturally, dress in warm  flannels, and serve with fish soup."  Strange, but it's the man who can't meet his creditors who  meets most of them.  Hard Boiled, Too!  Fussy and Talkative Customer: "Mr. Grocer, I want a dozen  strictly-fresh eggs!   Now don't try to palm off any storage stuff on  me, because my husband is very fussy and insists on strictly fresh  eggs"  Grocer, to himself:   "Well, he sure got one all right!"  Mixing The Brands  "I'll have a slice of that blackberry pie."  " 'Tain't blackberry," said the waitress, as she "shooed" the  flies away, "its custard."  French Lesson  "Pat, what does 'Vive la France' mean?"  "Sure, it's French for Th' Star Spangled Banner', me boy!"

February 25,1980  Welcome to Miami Beach.  A DAZZLING ATLANTIC OCEAN BEACH.  Miami Beach is one of the world's most magnificent  ocean resorts. Our tropical beach is 300 feet wide  and stretches for miles. It is dotted with swaying  palms, grass huts, and scenic promenades.  Our unmatched sun-filled climate lets you do  whatever your heart desires in the way of outdoor  activities. Ours is a subtropical island. With winter  temperatures consistently in the sunny 70's. In  summer we average a delightful 80° Our air is pure  and clean. Our ocean is a gentle blue sea whose surf  temperature is always 68° or above.

Funding comes from a working partnership of our  public and private sectors. Established in 1978 by  the Board of County Commissioners as an  agency of Metro-Dade County, the Center will be  maintained by county funds; exhibitions will be  financed through corporate sponsorship, private  philanthropy, tourist tax appropriations, and  state and federal grants.  The Center for the Fine Arts is located west of  the Dade County Courthouse, between Flagler  Street and North West First Street.  Heading north on 1-95: Take N.W. 2 St. exit, turn  right and park in the new Government Center  garage, 270 N.W 2 St.  Heading south on 1-95: Take Miami Ave. exit,  turn left at the bottom of ramp.

More than 12 million visitors from  around the world have enjoyed the lush  tropical gardens that over a thousand  exotic birds call home. For over 50  years this authentic Florida jungle has  been a preserve for free-flying macaws, magnificent flamingos and  rare parrots and cockatoos. Huge alligators, giant tortoises, prancing  peacocks and prehistoric-appearing iguanas are on exhibit. Stately  oaks and tall cypress trees shade the tropical foliage. Orchids,  flowering bananas, bromeliads, and bougainvillaeas burst with color  throughout the year.  This attraction is truly a "one  of a kind" in the world. There are  continuous shows throughout  the day in the Parrot Bowl  Theater—amazon parrots sing  and talk, cockatoos roller skate  and ride scooters while colorful  macaws count and play cards.  You can even hold these  beautiful birds for pictures and  talk with the trainers at the baby  bird arena, and there's a new  petting zoo and children's  playground.  Visit our gift shop and enjoy the  Parrot Cafe. Parrot Jungle and  Gardens is located south of  Miami International Airport off  U.S. Highway 1.

The festival focuses on our diverse  heritage including architectural  archaeological, the natural  environment, pioneer, and Indian  heritage through tours, special  events, and social gatherings.  Conferences and seminars are  sponsored in South Florida and  statewide with topics such as  development opportunities in  preservation, help for owners of  historic homes, and education for  preservation volunteers.  Guidebooks have been published by  DHT on Lemon City, our pioneer  settlement, and the Miami Beach  Architectural {Art Deco) District,  and tours are provided on request.  Public speaking circuits provide a  means of educating the community.  DHT has programs available to  clubs, church groups, schools and  other institutions.  Publications are provided for DHT  members including the monthly  newsletter with information about  current events and Preservation  Today, a nationally recognized  magazine.  Projects  William Wagner's Homestead circa  1856 is Dade County's oldest  standing residence. It was rescued by  DHT and restored and is now in  downtown Miami's hummus Park.  Dr. }ames M. Jackson's Office and  Surgery is the 1905 building first  used by }ames Jackson, Miami's first  doctor. The office is now DHT's  headquarters and Historic  Preservation Center.  Events  DHT sponsors a variety of events for  its members from educational tours  of historic areas to parties and  lectures. These events are held in  historic locations and allow DHT's  diverse group of members to meet  each other and share their views  about preservation in South Florida.

It is a beautiful and sleek combination of flying thrills  and cruise comfort. It's the excitement of actually  flying over the waves at 40 miles an hour, while highly  qualified Norwegian officers provide every assurance of a safe and comfortable voyage.  One of a fleet of three, your hydrofoil is 125 feet long  and accommodates 200 passengers, plus a crew of  12. Although it's one of the fastest vessels in the world,  the rhythm on board is easy and tropical. Passengers unwind in modern, air-conditioned interiors,  surrounded by breathtaking views of the sea.  Calypso music helps you catch the Bahamian spirit  the moment you step on board. Friendly stewardesses are nearby to make sure you receive every  attention - whether it's a tempting snack or a refreshing cocktail or beverage.  You can shop for duty-free bargains (there's everything from perfumes to liqueurs)... or join Lady Luck  at the slot machines. A ride on a Hydrofoil is a very  unique and exciting experience.

(SFAC), a non-profit corporation, was founded by  Ellie Schneiderman and a dedicated group of supporters in March, 1984, to provide South Florida's emerging and established artists with permanent, affordable  studio, showroom and classroom space in an area  that would benefit from their presence.  Lincoln Road was chosen as the site and the Art  Center's successful implementation of its programs  and goals was recognized by the City of Miami Beach  in 1986 with their designation of the 800,900 and 1000  blocks as the Lincoln Road Arts District.  EDUCATION  The Institute of the South Florida Art Center (TIS-  FAC) includes workshops, critiques and lectures with  nationally recognized artists.  The SFAC hosts Miami-Dade Community College's Wolfson Campus offering classes in the arts  and humanities for both continuing education and  college credit.  LINCOLN ROAD ARTS DISTRICT  Adding to the distinction enjoyed by the SFAC are  several galleries exhibiting work from Caribbean primitives to French post-impressionists. The cultural  institutions and art-related businesses now located in  the Arts District include the MIAMI CITY BALLET,  the COLONY THEATER and the DANCE  ASSOCIATION OF FLORIDA. A short walk away  are the Lincoln Theater housing the NEW WORLD  SYMPHONY, the MIAMI BEACH CONVENTION CENTER, the JACKIE GLEASON  THEATER OF THE PERFORMING ARTS and  the BASS MUSEUM OF ART and beyond, miles of  Atlantic seashore.  Interior, 810 Lincoln Road  Photo: Ron Olman  The SFAC is home to over 85 juried artists working in  media ranging from painting and sculpture to print-  making, glass, jewelry, clay and art-to-wear design.  Master craftsmen, recent graduates, established professionals and emerging artists share a dynamic sense  of discovery and community that gives the work  shown here a unique spirit and vision.  Facilities include a complete printmaking laboratory,  a kiln room, a clay workshop space, a darkroom,  classrooms and a multi-purpose space for films, lectures and exhibitions.

The  Caravel is the theme of the great house and dominates  the atmosphere of the Venetian Palazzo which in its  luxurious setting has a rare combined feeling of Italy,  Spain and France. The early Spanish adventurers  used to sail from "Biscay" in Spain to "Biscayne Bay"  at Miami and anchor their ships in the harbor before  the limestone cliffs. From among their caravels James  Deering took the name Vizcaya, their home port in  the Bay of Biscay —"Vizcaya!"  mm..  lite'  AN AUTHENTIC ITALIAN  PALAZZO ON BISCAYNE   BAY  Like a trip to Europe is a day spent at Vizcaya! The Palazzo  looks East to the rising sun with its unusual sculptured stone  breakwater in the form of a barge on Biscayne Bay. You  will thrill to . . . its ten acres of stately formal gardens and  fountains... the frescoed ceiling over its subterranean swimming pool... its shaded walks and garden statuary displayed  over 30 acres of what was once mangrove jungle. Vizcaya  today is recognized as one of America's greatest historic houses.  James Deering, co-founder of International Harvester, began  collecting art treasures for Vizcaya twenty years before its  construction.. Begun in 1912, nearly 1,000 artisans labored  for five years on the project. It is an original palace, not  a copy of any in existence, of the 16th to 18th century  Renaissance period.  Take this self-guided tour of the famous formal gardens—  and bring your camera to captiire^r^^lei^ of its many  old-world vistas. V   ™"    / •—  VIZCAYA TOUR  8  9  10  11.  12  13  1.

It's Miami's turn to host the  Eleventh World Orchid Conference. Every three  years, orchid lovers migrate the globe to a new  destination and come to rest in March 1984 in a city  rich in subtropical plant life and ambience. Since  1954, orchid hobbyists, commercial breeders, hardcore fanatics, and admirers have made the trek.  The Conference is a forum for the exchange  of ideas and the renewal of friendships, where the  official language is "orchidese." Seminars, meetings,  sightseeing and social functions keep conferees  happily involved in orchid-related activities.  Biologists, ecologists, breeders, and others  present the current findings related to orchidology  Over 60 of these experts will appear at the  sparkling new Convention Center. Five hundred  of five thousand can meet comfortably in luxurious  surroundings to hear programs for amateur grower  and technical expert.  Conferees, approximately 7,000, from virtually  every state, Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean,  Central/South America, Europe, England, Asia,  Australia, Japan, Malaysia, and Africa, will convene  in Miami. Indeed, a convivial and fascinating  group, diverse in idiom but united in appreciation  of orchids and continued pursuit of understanding.  After all, orchids comprise the largest family of  flowering plants, and more than one lifetime  might be necessary to observe all 30r000+  varieties!  -The Orchid Show  - Robert M. Scully Jr. - General Chairman  -An anxious participant  It's Positively Orchidaceous!  The Greatest Orchid Show on Earth! See over  two acres []00f000 square feet) of orchids on  display at the Coconut Grove Exhibition Center;  next to the marina in Coconut Grove. These  spacious exposition facilities are a short ride from  the Conference hub in downtown Miami.  Hundreds of thousands of orchids will be flown in  from many of the world's orchid-growing countries  to be displayed in stunning naturalized settings.  Florida's Everglades ecosystem will be portrayed  in a 20,000-square-foot waterscape featuring  multi-level observation decks and native flora  and fauna. A microcosm of the Southern Florida  environment will be created through the use of  mature native hardwood trees, 35-foot Sabal  Palmetto trees, tons of coral rock, aged cypress  decking and the "sheet water" that characterizes  the Everglades. Orchid clubs, hobby growers, and  commercial growers will show their prize  blooming plants in similar "au naturel"  surroundings. There's just nothing else like it in all  the world... and the entire mezzanine is devoted  to orchidaceous art.  America's Favorite Way to Fly!

The holder of this remarkable record is Sophie Tucker,  earlier known as a "red-hot mama," but now regretfully characterized as  the last of the species.  The span of Miss Tucker's ever-running career is beyond the common  order of things in a field as ephemeral as the entertainment industry.  When the big, jolly blonde with the throaty voice first sang for nickels  and dimes as an added attraction to the customers of her mother's restaurant in Hartford, Conn., horsecars provided the rapid means of transportation and American vaudeville was enjoying its greatest vitality and  vigor. Since then she has won audiences in vaudeville, Broadway shows,  movies, cafes and swanky night clubs. She is the first variety artist to be  honored with a reception by the Lord Mayor of London in recognition of  her especial talents. Tony Pastor, Gus Hill, Florenz Ziegfeld, Mclntyre  and Heath, Earl Carroll and the Shuberts are some of the nostalgic names  associated with Miss Tucker's illustrious career.  It is befitting therefore that her legion of friends and admirers gathered over the years should be tendering Miss Tucker a Golden Jubilee  Testimonial Dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria on October 4. At the artist's  insistence, the dinner has been turned into a huge charity affair. Sponsored  by the Jewish Theatrical Guild of America, the event will benefit the  Guild itself and seven other theatrical charity funds, namely, The Actors  Fund of America, the Will Rogers Memorial Hospital, the Motion Picture  Relief Fund, the American Guild of Variety Artists and the Catholic,  Episcopal and Negro Actors Guild.  To a versatile and generous trouper we say thanks for the half-century  of songs, some sad, some comic, but always entertaining. - 		image/tiff						87770832 Bytes	4368	6698	1794233717	RGB	8	600	asm02500000440005001.tif		2013-08-08	2013-08-08	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/211	211	212.jp2	/pamphlets/image/212.jp2

Y., TUESDAY, AUGUST 11, 1953  EDITORIAL  'Red Hot' Fifty Years!  We WERE DELIGHTED, naturally, to read that practically  everybody in the business like which there's no business is  getting together to honor wonderful Sophie Tucker with a  Golden Jubilee Testimonial Dinner on October 4.  But then the startling thought struck us that there was not  a Sophie Tucker in show business before 50 years ago. Could  that really be? We wondered. How could there have been  laughter and sheer happiness of living and kindly warmth in  the entertainment world without Sophie?  To us, it seems as if there must always have been a Sophie  Tucker. She is a living, vibrant legend, a nostalgic link to the  many years that have slipped by so quickly, a heartening assurance that we can believe in agelessness and changelessness.  It is especially fitting that the Jewish Theatrical Guild,  which is sponsoring the tribute at the Waldorf-Astoria, has  included seven other theatrical charities to benefit from the  occasion. It is a reflection of the greatness and goodness of  the beloved "Red Hot Mama" who has never been known to  shirk giving of herself and her red hot talent to all charities.  We're giving Sophie a pre-testimonial salute on the half-  century of happy times she has given to the multitudes who  have laughed and sighed and relaxed with her. She is truly  the First Lady of Show Business. 		image/tiff						87770832 Bytes	4368	6698	471488763	RGB	8	600	asm02500000440006001.tif		2013-08-08	2013-08-08	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/212	212	213.jp2	/pamphlets/image/213.jp2

FOREWORD  Trinity Cathedral, the oldest congregation in the City of Miami, was first  assembled by Bishop William Crane Gray in 1893. Organization followed in 1896  and a small wooden structure was erected for a church building on a site of  land given by Mrs. Julia Tuttle at what is now N.E. 2nd Avenue and 2nd Street.  A larger edifice was built in 1912 at the same intersection, but across from the  original. The present church was completed in 1926.  It is very unusual for a congregation approaching its 75th anniversary  to have had only six Rectors. This speaks well for the stability of the congregation and the leadership of the clergy who have served here. To the Reverend  Nathaniel Barnwell Fuller, we are indebted for the strength and spirit of  optimism he gave to a small group of Episcopalians in the pioneer days of  Miami. The Reverend James Cope, Ph.D., built the second church anticipating  the growth of the city. The ministry of the Reverend Albert Lester Hazlett,  D.D., left its mark of excellence on the members through his pastoral concern.  The Rector of great vision was the Reverend Robert Theodore Phillips who,  seeing the trend of Miami's growth to the Miramar section and desiring to  build a church equal in beauty to the churches of the North, encouraged architect Harold Hastings Mundy to design the church we worship in today. With  the great church came the great debt. It was during the aftermath of the  economic depression in this country that the Reverend George Irvine Hilier,  S.T.D., accepted the challenge to pay off an indebtedness of over $200,000.00.  Dr. Hilier accomplished this task by the example of his own integrity and, in  1946, Trinity Church was at last consecrated. Holy Comforter Church, today  a strong parish, began as a chapel of Trinity Church to accommodate communicants and Sunday School children living in the southwest section of town.  It is to the credit of Dr. Hilier that this mission was not closed and its assets  sold to pay the debts of the Mother Church. Dr. Hiller's rectorship also  provided the new parish house, completed debt free in 1957, and at the time  of his retirement, in 1963, he had made the interior of the church more beautiful through the completion of the stained glass windows, mosaic arch and  other appointments.  We serve the Diocese of Southeast Florida, which is one of the newest  dioceses of the Episcopal Church having been certified by General Convention  January 1, 1970. On Easter Day of that same year, the first Bishop of our new  Diocese, the Rt. Reverend James L. Duncan, D.D., proclaimed this parish  church his Cathedral. The Diocesan Offices are located on property south of  and adjoining the Cathedral yard.  You may wish to visit the Cathedral Bookstore in the parish house and  browse among the book selection and many gift items of more than usual  interest. The Bookstore is open daily from 10:00 a.m. until 4:00 p.m. and on  Saturdays and Sundays until Noon.  ARCHITECTURE AND APPOINTMENTS  The narthex, or vestibule, has a floor of Spanish tile in which are set  various symbols of the Christian faith. The tiles were hand-painted before  glazing and recent cleaning has restored their original bright colors. Please  examine the narthex screen made of chestnut wood with its latice designs  and gilded cherubs. 		image/tiff						59345214 Bytes	3627	5454	3163171724	RGB	8	600	asm02500000290001001.tif		2013-08-08	2013-08-08	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/226	226	227.jp2	/pamphlets/image/227.jp2
Page 2																																http://merrick.library.miami.edu/digitalprojects/copyright.html	asm0250000029	asm02500000290002001		Passing through the inner doors, you see before you the nave and side  transepts which give the church its traditional cruciform design. Mr. Mundy,  the architect, was a world-traveler who incorporated much of what he had  seen in Europe into the building of this church. The Romanesque arches  framing the exceptionally wide nave and the use of mosaic encrustments on the  wall surfaces were inspired by Mr. Mundy's visit to the famous St. Remi  Cathedral at Ravenna, Italy.  The nave of Trinity Church, rising 70 feet, is one of the highest in the  South. The capital on each pillar carries two sets of symbols, alternating from  column to column. The symbols represent the Four Evangelists: the Lion for  St. Mark, the Ox for St. Luke, the Lamb for St. Matthew and the Eagle for  St. John. The symbols are painted in rich colors to "bring them to life." The  use of color and gilt on stone carvings is an ancient practice of which much  evidence is still to be seen in the abbeys and cathedrals of England.  Walking to the middle of the nave and turning around, you can see the  magnificent rose window dominating the west end above the gallery. The  colors intensify as the sun moves behind the window until it is a blaze of  light in the late afternoon. The rose window is a memorial to Julia Tuttle  one of Miami's most famous pioneers. Such windows are not uncommon; the  superimposing of a Latin cross over the rose tracery makes this one unique.  Continuing down the center aisle to the chancel steps, you will notice  a patterned relief of quatrefoih on the face of the chancel wall. The stone  castings on the pulpit are, again, the symbols of the Four Evangelists, with  St. John Baptist on the facing panel.  Central to the Christian life is the Sacrament of Holy Communion. For  this reason, the altar is the focal point in the church. Here the marble altar,  baldachino, and floor design are distinguished by patterns of five Florentine  marbles. The reredos backing the altar is a Venetian glass mosaic with the  Flowered Cross symbol of the Resurrection and the Angels of the Resurrection  on either side. The mosaic on the face of the altar is the Lamb of God. It is  exceptionally fine because of the exquisite shadings of colors the artist achieved  by his choice of glass fragments.  Above the altar and crowning the sanctuary is a mosaic entitled "the heavens  and all the powers therein" inspired by the stanza from the Te Deum. The  apsidial curve and subject matter suggest Eternity and a looking-beyond the  immediacies of the Church Militant to the Church Expectant and Triumphant.  Soaring high above the sanctuary is the triumphal arch with its mosaic  encrustment. Again, the symbols of the Four Evangelists are used in the  circles only this time a human head is substituted for the symbol of St.-  Matthew. The circle in the highest point of the arch presents the Gate of  Heaven and the Crown of Glory. God's creative activity, as described in the  Book of Genesis, occupies the six oblong panels. The mosaic arch was given in  memory of Victor J. Sharman by his wife.  The organ is placed behind the wooden screen in such a way that every  division of the instrument sounds out to the congregation. It is sad to find  in so many churches the placement of the organ pipes in a recessed area or  room which cannot but diminish the sound. We are fortunate here in having  the pipes placed across the width of the nave and facing the people. The  instrument is a four manual console controlling 52 ranks. It was built by Ernest  M. Skinner in 1926 during the late Romantic period of organ design. The  children of Joseph H. Clark gave this organ in memory of their father. Recent  additions to the instrument, built by the Aeolian-Skinner Company, have made  it possible for the organist to register all periods of organ music, Classical as  well as Romantic. The reverbratory qualities of the building and the dramatic  setting enhance the richness of sound and sight.  The most commanding stop on the organ is the State Trumpet with its  pipes positioned horizontally on either side of the rose window in the west end.  The brilliant sound is reminiscent of the State Trumpeters of England who  herald the arrival of the Monarch.  The Cathedral sponsors a Concert Series open to the public without charge.  The Dean and Chapter feel a strong responsibility to share in the cultural  and spiritual life of the community by bringing the world's greatest organists to  Miami. Heard in recital here have been Dupre, Crozier, Langlais, Durefle, Alain,  Preston, Swan, Fox as well as aspiring students.  Turning, now, to your right, the aisle windows on the southside tell the  story of our Saviour's life. Beginning with the window nearest to the altar, the  major events in the life of Christ are there to instruct and inspire. The glass  is of French design with foliated borders in many colors.  On the northside of the church the aisle windows are of special interest to  persons conscious of history Again, beginning with the window nearest the altar,  the saints, scholars and monarehs of the church in England, Scotland, Ireland  and Wales are chronologically set forth under the seals of their respective countries, dioceses, or institutions. The late Arthur Vining Davis presented these  windows to the church in memory of his wife, Elizabeth Hawkins Davis.  Series of large uniform windows high in the clerestory allow light to enter  the church and at the same time provide another opportunity for teaching  through the medium of stained glass. Thirteen of the windows have symbols of  our Lord's miracles and parables in the center lancets and the Benedicite is  pictured verse by verse in each of the side lancets. These windows are the  gift of Robert Pentland in memory of his Mother, Annie Baron Pentland.  The fourteenth clerestory window (southeast corner) was actually one  of the first windows placed in the church when it was built. It shows Christ  the Teacher as He so frequently appears in the Gospel record. Many think  that this window is the most beautiful glass in the church.  The Baptismal Font is placed in the center aisle because Baptism is the  entrance into the Christian life. This is also a memorial to Julia Tuttle, reflecting the high esteem in which she was held by the members of this congregation.  The mosaic encrustments on the spandrels connecting the main arches of  the nave are the Biblical record of the events happening along the Via Dolorosa  on Good Friday sometimes called the Stations of the Cross. Beginning with  Pilate sentencing Jesus to death on the spandrel nearest the altar-end on the  north side, and concluding with the entombment of Jesus on the opposite  spandrel.  FUTURE PLANS  As with so many cathedrals throughout history and in our own time, with  construction phased-out over years, Trinity Cathedral is far from being completed.  The campanile, or bell tower, designed as part of the original plans, is yet  to be built although the foundation was placed in 1924. A set of bells in the  proposed tower would be their own witness to the place of the church in  the community. It is our hope someday to have a chapel adjoining the north-  side of the church at the transept for services which might rather be held in  a smaller area. Eventually the floor of the choir area will be flagged with  marble design equal in beauty to the existing sanctuary floor. We would like  to see choir stalls replace the present pews in that area. 		image/tiff						118362948 Bytes	7234	5454	1139168562	RGB	8	600	asm02500000290002001.tif		2013-08-08	2013-08-08	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/227	227	228.jp2	/pamphlets/image/228.jp2

BEFORE LEAVING  Reflect a moment on the faith of the members and friends of this church,  living and dead, who believed that the House of God is a living witness in the  community and whose generosity made possible the beauty which lifts the  heart and stirs the soul.  Kneel therefore, and offer your prayers for those who minister here,  for those who worship here, for those whose hands are open for the continuance  of God's Church, and for yourself, that God may bless the visit which you  have made this day.  O Lord Jesus Christ, who art thyself the temple of the holy City of God,  the light thereof and its surpassing glory; glorify and lighten, we beseech  thee, with thy perpetual presence this earthly house built gloriously to  thee: and be pleased both to inspire and to accept its worship day by  day, the praise of thankful lips and the prayers of faithful hearts; who  livest and reignest with the Father and the Holy Ghost, one God, for  ever and ever.

Coming  through the '26 hurricane with no damage.  Ask the Chamber of Commerce or any Miami  Business Man about the Se-Bot-M Boat; Come  with us, you will enjoy our 27 foot wide Se-  Bot-M Boatride, and will never forget the  wonders we will show you on the Coral Reef.  Z^IORAL: What is Coral? Nearly a pure ealci-  *^ um carbonate. The Polyps, a little animal  so small that a million would go in a lady's  thimble, are able to separate this calcium carbonate from the ocean water and deposit it in  quantity enough to make great islands. A  great part of the Florida peninsula is on the  coral rock. The Pacific ocean, between the  thirteenth parallel of latitude on each side of  the Equator is a great nursery of Coral islands. Between Malabar and Madagascar there  is a great Sea of Corals. An unbroken reef  350 miles long on the east coast of New Holland and between New Holland and New  Guinea coral formations extend throughout a  distance of 700 miles with no intervals exceeding 30 miles. The United States has no  coral except the reef from Miami to Key  West. The West Indies, Bermuda and the  Mediterranean Sea have coral. Coral formations are among the oldest and the newest  rocks that come under the notice of the geologist. Coral is found underlying the coal  fields. Our lime and marble quarries were at  one time Coral beds. The forms and hues built  by the little animals of the sea are almost  endless, imitating with striking exactness the  plant life. They have done more for the world  than all other animals combined. "The half  was never told." It's wonderful; see it on the  Florida reef.  Cigars, Cigarettes, Soft Drinks, Coffee and  Lunch can be had on board.  Visitors Welcome       - Come Aboard  SE-BOT-M BOAT CO.  W. I. STILES, Capt. E. V. STILES, Mate  /""rr^v F. I.  STILES,  Mgr.

Is   Not   a   Glass   Bottom   Boat,   But   a   Boat  With   a   Large   Independent   Glass  Tray 6|  x 25 Feet.  WE start from the City Yacht Basin, passing the Miami River, the Royal Palm  Hotel, and Brickell Point, going south  down beautiful Biscayne Bay, affording a  bird's-eye view of the wonderful homes along  Millionaire Row, including that of the late  William J. Bryan and the Deering Estate.  Looking east we see the Keys lying south of  Miami Beach and the cuts dividing them; and  on the southwest point of Key Biscayne we  pass W. J. Matheson's magnificent private  club house "Mashta." Then comes Cape Florida, on which still stands the old Lighthouse  built in 1826. From here we skirt the Florida  Banks, noted for their beautiful colorings,  (or take the Mangrove Channel, passing Cape  Florida and going to the outside reef). From  this location we see ocean steamers passing  in the edge of the Gulf Stream. Before leaving the Florida Banks the Ragged Keys are  sighted to the south. Leaving Biscayne Bay at  Soldier's Key we pass into the ocean, where  we find the wonderful submarine gardens on  the coral reef. Here the large glass is lowered  to the water's surface and the countless varieties of plant and animal life clearly displayed.  These gardens are classed among the wonders  of the world. The return trip is usually made  by Cape Florida and the Mangrove Channel.  rpHE boat is constructed of two separate  A hulls or pontoon-like boats leaving an oper  space between them connected by timbers  and planking forward and aft and the superstructure comprising the cabin, engine-room,  galley, etc. The double construction of the  boat prevents it from rolling, or capsizing  though all passengers rushed to one side.  rpHE cabin is so arranged that it excludes  the light and is well ventilated. In the cabin the large glass which is lowered into this  open space between the hulls (about which  fifty people may be seated, all seeing the  same objects at the same time) floats on the  surface of the water, making the water  smooth so the objects on the bottom are clearly seen without distortion. The glass is not  a part of the boat and its breaking (if this  occurred) would in no way endanger the boat,  for the glass is a separate feature and is only  in the water when the sea bottom is being  shown—a vast improvement over the old style  glass bottom boat where the glass is built into  and made a part of the boat. The boat rides  smoothly through the water and is not liable to  cause seasickness. The word Se-Bot-M, trade  mark registered in U. S. Patent Office, applies to our type only and this boat is the only  one in operation, invented and built here at  Miami. Patented March 15, 19-21, July 6, 1926,  other patents pending. 87 feet long, 21-foot  beam, two decks with 3,000 feet deck space,  equipped with two six-cylinder engines, 400  horsepower, a 110-volt lighting plant, music,  dancing, 150 comfortable chairs, two lavatories. Carries a crew of seven. Lecturers will  tell you about Florida and the trip. The Captain was master of naval vessels during the  World War. This is our tenth year.  T^O not confuse the Se-Bot-M Boat with glass  bottom boats. The Se-Bot-M Boat was designed and built under patents for the express  purpose of showing the ocean bottom, which  can be shown up to about half speed of boat.  The conning station on the bridge high above  the water gives the pilot a great advantage,  particularly in view of the high maneuverability of the boat due to its 400 horse power and  twin screws. This enables him to keep the boat  over the most interesting sections. While the  guide points out and names the objects under  the glass. There are no worth while submarine  gardens that can be seen on any shorter trip  than we make or we would show them.

The hues are seen in the  pastel palette of historic  architecture and in the spectrum of  food, shopping, entertainment and  culture.  WELCOME TO OUR  NEIGHBORHOOD  Since 1 986, scores of new businesses  have appeared on South Beach. This  dynamic growth has cultivated an unusual  sense of community spirit and cooperation.  The Deco District Network is a group of enthusiastic entrepreneurs working together in  order to realize the economic potential of  South Pointe and the Art Deco District.  Staffed by Miami Beach Development  Corporation, The Network is committed to  providing quality service to its patrons and  encouraging first rate businesses to locate  within the area.  ART DECO  RESIDENCES  The Best Selection on South Beach  Studios  1 Bedroom  2 Bedrooms  Town Houses  Newly Remodeled  From Economy to Luxury  CHRISKEN MANAGEMENT  532-1600  THE HISTORIC  ART DECO DISTRICT  South Beach includes the Miami Beach  Architectural District (Art Deco District), the  largest concentration of Art Deco  architecture in the world. Influenced by turn  of the century industrialization, Art Deco's  playful design was intended to stimulate the  observer's fantasy and provide escape from  the realities of the Great Depression. Each  Thirties' structure has its own personality,  viewed in the streamline of smooth curves,  nautical motifs, and barrel tile roof tops.  In 1979, under the leadership of  Barbara Capitman and the Miami Design  Preservation League, the Miami Beach  Architectural District was the first twentieth  century historic district to be placed on the  National Register of Historic Places. Soon  after, local designer Leonard Horowitz set  an artistic trend, emphasizing the deco  design features through a new pastel  presentation; "Tropical Deco" has had an  international response, attracting numerous  film makers, fashion photographers, and  world travelers.

EVERY DAY  Tour No. 8: Scenic tour to Villa Vizcaya  NITE LITE TOUR  The magic beauty of Miami by moonlight.  EVERY EVENING  Tour No. 9: Scenic, narrated tour of the Greater  Miami Area at night.  FULL FARE: $5.00  HALF FARE: $2.50  includes admission  children 12 and under  FULL FARE: $4.00  HALF FARE: $2.25  children 12 and under  The late James Deering spent nearly $15,000,000 and over 20 years  collecting art treasures, planning and building Villa Vizcaya, today  recognized as one of America's greatest historic houses. Surrounded by  10 acres of formal gardens and fountains, the main building (palace is  a better word) itself and the objects d'art it contains take one back  to the artistic beauty of 300 years ago.  There aren't sufficient superlatives to describe Vizcaya; only your  appreciative eyes can fully capture the immeasurable beauty and aura  it creates.  Gray Line Sightseeing Tours, Inc. is  a division of Chromalloy American  Corporation.  This 3 hour, 70 mile tour is literally our driver's favorite. In the relative  quiet of the early evening hours, the stars and the moon over Miami  together with millions of electric lights show the beauty of "our town"  to be entirely different than in the daytime.  Everyone enjoys downtown Miami's skyline, the full length of Collins  Avenue, Miami International Airport, Miracle Mile in Coral Gables and  the reflections in Biscayne Bay. A mid-way rest stop is scheduled during  which you can enjoy your favorite evening snack. (Price does not  include snack)  Gray Line also provides transportation  to, and from,   race tracks, dog tracks  and Jai Alai.  printed in the USA 		image/tiff						77703378 Bytes	4749	5454	3017701707	RGB	8	600	asm02500000030002001.tif		2013-08-08	2013-08-08	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/245	245	246.jp2	/pamphlets/image/246.jp2

TUESDAY, THURSDAY AND SUNDAY  Tour No.  5:  Narrated  scenic tour  to  Everglades  National Park and the Orchid Jungle  FULL FARE: $9.50 - CHILDREN 12 AND UNDER: $7.00  Includes luncheon and Orchid Jungle admission.  National Park charge of 501  a person collected at Park entrance.  This is an all day trip to America's most unusual National Park-  a vast (almost VA million acres) subtropical wilderness where land and  water merge to form a wildlife haven of unusual beauty. On the drive  to Flamingo, you'll observe large numbers of exotic and colorful birds  seldom, if ever, seen elsewhere in the country. The Park is the home of  the alligator, 'possum, raccoon, deer and many other interesting  animals. The abundant vegetation includes fascinating and unusual  plants such as wild orchids, plus mangrove, cypress, mahogany, and  gumbo-limbo trees.  An unforgettable experience is the side excursion to the breathtaking  Orchid Jungle. Here visitors are treated to an overwhelming spectacle  of thousands of blooming orchids collected from every part of the  world, growing along the trails in a natural 30-acre tropical jungle.  Countless wild and hybrid species make it a photographer's paradise and  each lady visitor receives a free orchid as a momento of her visit.  %  PARROT JUNGLE  One of Florida's most popular and spectacular attractions.  TWICE DAILY  MORNING AND AFTERNOON  Tour No. 6: Narrated scenic tour to the Parrot Jungle  FULL FARE: $7.00 — includes admission  HALF  FARE: $3.50 - children 12 and under  The Parrot Jungle nestles in 12 acres of tropical foliage and is the home  of an estimated 1200 rare birds. Since 1936 it has played host to  visitors from all over the world. Flying free in the trees are some 150  brilliantly colored macaws floating gently through the tree-tops at will.  On the ground, a flock of over 100 flamingos live in and around their  own private lake and 'on cue' they gracefully parade across the green  at showtime.  And, showtime in the new Parrot Bowl is a delightful experience for  everyone. A cast between twenty-five and thirty macaws and cockatoos keep their audiences fascinated as they roller skate, ride scooters  and bicycles, play poker, solve arithmetic problems, answer the phone  and perform many other amazing demonstrations.  Answer the 'phone? The amusing mynah birds will talk directly to you!  And, especially trained colorfully plumed scarlet, blue-gold and green  winged macaws will pose on your arm or shoulder for pictures. As you  enter be sure to say, "Hello", to Jeannie, the Mexican yellow-head,  the Parrot Jungle's official greeter, who also, may sing "Farmer in the  Dell" for you.  There's color galore in the Parrot Jungle so bring plenty of film with  which to permanently record your visit to this fantasy-land of birds.  SEAQUARIUM  The world's largest marine aquarium.  TWICE DAILY  MORNING AND AFTERNOON  Tour No. 7: Narrated scenic tour to the Seaquarium  FULL FARE: $7.00 — includes admission  HALF FARE: $3.50 - children 12 and under  Perhaps it should be spelled "SEEquarium" because there's so much to  see and learn about the ocean depths from the fabulous Seaquarium's  collection of numberless examples of living sea life.  Showtime means exciting entertainment for everyone. Newest and biggest star is HUGO the giant killer whale performing in the new half-  million gallon WHALE BOWL. High atop the huge main tank, trained  porpoises leap into the sky, dance on their tails and perform other feats  to demonstrate their intelligence and training. Another show under the  Golden Aquadome features porpoises playing basketball and bowling  plus the hilarious antics of trained sea lions (seals) and even the humble  pelicans perform.  Meet TV star FLIPPER in his special, private pool; visit the LOST  ISLANDS for more surprises; ride Miami's only monorail; watch spine-  chilling sharks fight each other at feeding time. Through the many  aquarium show windows, watch (and photograph) countless, fascinating  sea dramas as they happen just inches away.  Indeed, there's much to see and learn and enjoy at the Seaquarium. 		image/tiff						115304286 Bytes	7073	5434	4199005826	RGB	8	600	asm02500000030003001.tif		2013-08-08	2013-08-08	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/246	246	247.jp2	/pamphlets/image/247.jp2

MONDAY, WEDNESDAY & FRIDAY  Tour No. 2: MONKEY JUNGLE and CORAL CASTLE  FULL FARE: $7.00 — includes all admissions  HALF FARE: $3.50 - children  12 and under  This 6 hour lectured tour covers approximately 75 miles. First stop is at  the world famous Monkey Jungle, where the humans are caged and  monkeys run wild. Its fascinating "population" numbers over 500 with  more than 50 species from the deepest jungles of six continents.  Trained chimpanzee shows are a delight for everyone. Stroll through  the lush, tropical Rain Forest and see the monkeys roaming free in  their natural habitat. Watch skin diving Javanese monkeys frolic in  their own private swimming pools. You'll be fascinated at "feeding  time" in the Rain Forest as its residents come from the trees to the  food platforms. Meet BULU, a 22-year-old, 600 pound gorilla, his mate  MITZI and many others. Bring your camera; you may meet "somebody" who looks like someone you know.  At Coral Castle, you'll see the fantastic creation of one man—  Edward Leedskalnin. Weighing only 100 pounds, he single-handedly  quarried giant coral rocks, sculpted them and assembled the castle and  its furnishings: contour chairs, beds, a 9 ton swinging gate, moon  fountain, even a rocking cradle and many other items, all made of coral.  Since his death in 1951, engineers have been unable to determine how  he did it alone. Why he did it makes Coral Castle even more fascinating.

Long time residents who take this  tour see fascinating sights they've missed over the years and learn  interesting facts about "their" town.  First stop is the world famous Hialeah Park.* During a narrated tram  ride through the colorfully landscaped grounds, you'll see the majestic  flock of pink flamingos, rare tropical birds and visit the marine aquarium/museum and learn about Hialeah Park and the development of  thoroughbred horse racing in Florida.  Other stops will be made at unique Venetian Pool in Coral Gables and  beautiful Plymouth Church in Coconut Grove.  This personally guided tour is designed for visitors to comfortably see  the magical beauty and learn as much as possible about the interesting  history of the Greater Miami area.  *Hialeah Park omitted during its racing meet. 		image/tiff						78396558 Bytes	4809	5434	2325484479	RGB	8	600	asm02500000030004001.tif		2013-08-08	2013-08-08	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/247	247	248.jp2	/pamphlets/image/248.jp2

He  dedicated most of his life to removing these enormous  stones from the earth, and then carving statue groupings  glorifying Astronomy, Magnetism, his lost love "Sweet  Sixteen," Florida State, the Family, etc. The creation of  CORAL CASTLE, and especially the perfect balance of the  nine ton swinging rock gate, still puzzles scientists. Now a  museum, CORAL CASTLE has been compared to  Stonehenge and the Egyptian Pyramids.  • Guided tours • Gift shop and film  • Refreshments • Bring your camera!

ESPECIALLY THIS YEAR!  People began discovering Southeastern Florida's  pleasant summer climate long before the war. As more  vacationists came to Miami Beach in summer, more and  more living accommodations and facilities for fun and  relaxation were made available—at reduced summer  rates. By 1941, winter and summer seasons differed  only in scope and in costs.  Then came the war. Almost all of our hotels were  utilized in the Army's vast training program. Now our  great war job is finished and we are back in "resort"  operation . . . with all the comfortable and attractive  accommodations, gay diversions and beautiful surroundings which have drawn people here for rest and play  from every state and every civilized nation at every  season of the year.  Following an all-time record winter season, more  thousands than ever before are choosing Miami Beach  as their summer vacation headquarters. This summer,  gloriously beautiful, sea-cooled Miami Beach, with  hundreds of "luxury" hotels and fine apartment houses  remaining open, offers a degree of spacious comfort  available nowhere else in the world.  With most of the nation's resorts literally bursting at  the seams, the advantages offered by America's cool,  uncrowded "tropic paradise" become overwhelmingly  persuasive reasons why you'll be wise to come to Miami  Beach for your vacation.  STRAIGHT TALK ABOUT THE WEATHER  Right here (for the benefit of "first timers") let's get  #rid of the notion that Miami Beach is hot just because  - it's so far south. The mean average summer temperature  is 80.5°, only 10° above winter averages. The mercury  rises above 90° an average of only five days a year and  the all-time high (it only happened once!) was 96°.  Cooling, easterly trade wind breezes, averaging above  10 m.p.h., are dependably constant. Summer showers  are of short duration and seldom steal more than a few  hours from one's entire vacation. Humidity is not abnormally high and ranges are exceptionally small. These  U. S. Weather Bureau facts and figures prove that Miami  Beach is actually cooler and more comfortable than  many a city far north of here; and that our summer  weather is delightful by any standard or comparison.

Yet the City's 331 resort hotels and 944  apartment buildings, provided sufficient accommodations. A large percentage of these rooms and apartments are available for summer occupancy. Although  thousands plan to come, the volume of summer visitors will not approach that of our record winter season  .  .  . There will be plenty of room here this summer!  YOU CAN AFFORD IT—Summer rates are far  below winter levels. They compare favorably with those  of many Northern  resorts  offering  only  a  fraction  of  the service, appointments and diversion that are yours  at Miami Beach.  Fast, frequent, low-cost air, rail and bus transportation will bring you here in a few hours. Miami Beach  has  plenty  of  parking  space  if you drive.  And always remember this: The exotic, ever-thrilling  tropical charm of unique Miami Beach is free.  PLENTY GOING ON—On the inside page we  outline an array of suntime and afterdark activities  only possible in America's own golden playground of  the tropics. When you add this bountiful treasure of  fun and diversion to all the other advantages of Miami  Beach, a summer vacation here makes sense in a big  and challenging way—this year as never before!  FAVORITE FOR CONVENTIONS-/» —  and fall thousands of delegates attend conventions in  Miami Beach. They enjoy more luxurious, uncrowded  comfort than they'd expect ANYWHERE this year.  Competent, courteous service is a matter of course in a  city dedicated to entertaining visitors. The Miami Beach  Convention Bureau, a department of the city government,  assits in the planning and arranging of outstanding  conventions. Address convention inquiries to the City Hall. 		image/tiff						110085188 Bytes	7375	4975	1536544052	RGB	8	600	asm02500000950002001.tif		2013-08-08	2013-08-08	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/268	268	269.jp2	/pamphlets/image/269.jp2

GLAMOUR SHOTS —Every vista of this tropic  showplace is a charm-packed picture for eye or camera.  Sightseeing facilities include boat and bus trips along  shimmering waterways to numerous "millionaires' rows,"  Seminole Indian villages, famous estates and fabulous  skylines.

By mapping out our program in advance,  we can get a fair idea of the delights of this Land  of Palm and Sunshine. Let us first take a motor  tour through the city and its environs. Sightseeing is a real delight over the 100 miles of  smooth avenues, shaded with palms and beautified with tropical shrubbery and flowers.  Starting from Royal Palm Park, we can drive  along the Bay, wThere luxurious yachts and  speedy power boats are at anchor, pass the Municipal Dock, centre of shipping, then cross one  of the two causeways to the Beach. Back to  the mainland, our way will lead through exclusive Miramar, along the Dixie Highway to  the beautiful suburbs fronting Biscayne Bay.  Returning, we cross the Miami River to Point  View and Millionaires' Row, and continue to  Coconut Grove, home of celebrities. And we  complete a full day's ride by our return through  Coral Gables, with its Spanish atmosphere, and  Hialeah—Miami's sport centre, reminiscent of  Old Mexico.  A Close Finish  SECOND  DAY  BOATING ON MULTI-HUED WATERS. Those  who love the water—and who of us does  not?—will find pleasure in abundance on  the vari-colored surface of Biscayne Bay, or the  restless Ocean, or the calm waters of the River.  There are boats of every type, from the dory  with its outboard motor to the excursion  steamer, from the fast skimming sea sled to the  palatial yacht, from the little fishing boat to the  huge cargo-laden steamship. This is truly the  all-year paradise of the yachtsman and the  motor-boat enthusiast. We get a new vision of  the beauties of Miami on a boat trip through  these waters. The Islands in the Bay resemble  a transplanted Venice. We experience a new  thrill from the City's majestic skyline, with its  high buildings and imposing towers. Looking  towards the Sea, we glimpse the chain of palm-  bordered Keys and historic Cape Florida Light.  We can gaze, through a glass-bottomed observatory, at the strange vegetation and colorful  fish in the Marine Gardens, and we can glide up  the Miami River to view the Tropical Gardens,  the Alligator Farm and the Seminole Village.—  Then a canoe or a gondola in the moonlight—a  perfect setting for a tropical romance.  ,-.jfV.......  On the Home Stretch, Miami Jockey Club  THIRD  DAY  Choose Your Outdoor Sport—No matter what your sport preference may be—  unless it requires ice or snow—you may  enjoy it under the most favorable, and yet  "different" surroundings in tropical Miami, in  every season of the year. A dozen golf courses  lure the wielder of brassie and midiron. Only a  few minutes from the centre of town, the sporty  Miami Country Club course offers unrivaled  opportunity for the display of golfing skill.  Then there is the Municipal Course at Hialeah,  where you may see the picturesquely-garbed  Seminole Indian, playing the roll of caddy.  You may elect to drive and putt in a charming  Spanish setting at Coral Gables, or follow the  gutta-percha ball within sight and sound of old  Ocean's billows on one of the several courses  on Miami Beach. Tennis enthusiasts will find  an added zest on the well-kept courts amid  tropical surroundings. There are bridle paths  for the horse lover at Hialeah, Miami Beach,  and Coral Gables, and followers of racing may  see the country's fastest steeds perform at the  million-dollar track at Hialeah during the season. Polo, bowling on the green, roque, quoits  —name your sport and you can enjoy it here.  •-.■■ «m  January Bathing Scene at the Beach  FOURTH DAY  Bathing Under Smiling Skies—Nowhere  can there be found a more perfect setting  for the full enjoyment of the pleasures of  disporting in the tangy salt water of the Ocean  than at Miami Beach, just a short ride across the  causeways from the centre of the city. You  may rest and recreate at any one of the inviting  spots along the miles of clean, hard sand, in the  shade of a coconut palm, or under one of the  huge, multi-colored beach umbrellas, or in an  oriental-canopied easy chair. Bathing here is  an all-year-round pleasure. It is particularly  enjoyable in the winter, when most of the outside country is covered with snow and ice, and  chilled by wintry winds. The warm waters of  the Gulf Stream give the Ocean here an average  winter temperature of 72 degrees. Or you may  swim in the pools at the casinos, mecca of the  world's champion natatores, and scene of contests among beautiful bathing girls. The Venetian Pool at Coral Gables offers fresh-water  bathing, swimming and diving, in an incomparably artistic environment. And you can  bring your day to a happy close with a motor  drive along the Ocean, and a dinner and dance  at one of the casinos or hotels.  Winter or Summer, Nature Smiles the Same  FIFTH DAY  Fishing That Thrills—Do you like to  battle with the big fellows out in the ocean,  or do you prefer to play the gamey bass that  thrive in inside waters? Whichever your preference, there is sport for you here aplenty. Seagoing fishing craft, piloted by captains, who have  the same love for "the contemplative man's recreation" that you have, will take you out to the  Gulf Stream where the big game fish abound.  While trolling for the sailfish that will give you  the fight of your life, you will have many a set-to  with barracuda, kingfish, mackerel, dolphin, and  bonita. Anglers flock here, and in the waters a  little td the south for the most exciting fishing to  be found anywhere, the silver tarpon being  monarch. Both in the Bay and outside, you  will land grouper, trout, snapper, amberjack,  pompano, and many other varieties, numbering  six hundred,—while those who go in for fresh  water fishing get their thrills in the Miami River,  in the drainage canals, and the Tamiami Canal.  Here they cast for the black bass of the Everglades, a fighting fish of larger size and weight  than the Northern bass. As an incentive for  record catches, the Miami Anglers' Club annually distributes many handsome trophies.  Water Sports at Venetian  Casino  SIXTH DAY  Exploring the Everglades—Ever since  you were a child, when you first read in  your geography about the Everglades of  Florida, you have wondered what they were like.  Here is your opportunity to visit them. You  may travel along the Miami River, past the  Country Club, and the Allapattah truck and  flower gardens to Hialeah. Here you may visit  the Curtis-Bright ranch of blooded stock, pass  through the Miami dairy region, and quickly  reach the edge of the Everglades. An interesting sight in the reclaimed 'Glades is the 150,000  acre plantation of the Pennsylvania Sugar Company, with cane fields and a $1,500,000 mill.  Or you may travel to the Everglades along the  Tamiami Trail, through a region filled with  truck farms growing fine crops on the muck soil.  Still another route is along the continuation of  the Dixie Highway to Royal Palm State Park,  which consists of 4,000 acres of Everglades hammock land set apart as a Bird and Fish Sanctuary. Extensive groves of grapefruit, orange,  avocado, and other tropical fruit trees are  especially cultivated in the section south of  Miami. A trip to the Everglades is well worth  while.  Arthur Pryor's Band, In Free Concerts Daily  SEVENTH DAY  Day For Culture. Start your day by  attending services at one of the many  beautiful houses of worship in the City.  All of the principal religions and denominations  have their churches and temples. Profit from  the discourses of the pastors, and derive aesthetic  and spiritual enjoyment from the well-trained  choirs and excellent organ music. Then take a  stroll through the City to get a clearer idea of the  growth that has caused Miami to be known all  over the world as the "Magic City"—the city  that all the world wants to visit. Note the  metropolitan aspects on every hand, the modern  department stores, the fashion shops, and other  retail establishments, the imposing financial institutions, the towering office buildings, the  huge structures now in course of construction.  In the afternoon, you may listen to Pryor's Band  in the open air, under the waving coconut palms  in Royal Palm Park.  If you have followed this program, you will  have just begun to see the wonders of Miami,  and will understand why those who visit Miami  once return year after year to enjoy her incomparable climate, and all the pleasures and recreations which she offers. 		image/tiff						144524784 Bytes	12670	3802	1086636693	RGB	8	600	asm02500000920002001.tif		2013-08-08	2013-08-08	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/272	272	273.jp2	/pamphlets/image/273.jp2

During- the Seminole uprisings, in  1835, the United States Government erected old  Port Dallas, a part of which is still preserved.  The first step in Miami's progress was the extension of the Florida East Coast Railway to this  point in 1896. Three months later, the city was  incorporated.  America's Fastest Growing: City—Nation-wide  attention was turned to Miami in 1920, when the  United States census showed a growth unequalled  hy any other city or county in the nation,—440  per cent gain for Miami and 258 per cent gain for  Dade County.

Ready for Season—Same as Usual  September 18, 1926 a "West Indian hurricane, the  severest that ever struck the United States mainland,  caused great loss, especially to poorly constructed  homes. More than one hundred lives were lost in Dade  County. Miami was never materially damaged before.  The wind had not ceased blowing before Miamians  began a rehabilitation that has amazed the world in its  speed and efficiency.  Of the hotels 75 per cent were not damaged to any  great extent, the heavy rain causing greatest loss. Of  the apartment houses 70 per cent received minor damages.  "Within thirty days practically all hotels and apartments were in normal condition and Mayor Romfh  officially assured the country that by December 1, 1926  Miami would afford visitors the same enjoyable, hospitable, comfortable facilities as in the past.  Miami has set a pace never duplicated in urban  growth. The record breaking comeback from the storm  indicates the spirit that created this wonder city. The  National Geographic Society has just issued a bulletin  from United States Weather Bureau records showing  that hurricanes never occur during the winter months. 		image/tiff						143386064 Bytes	12640	3781	649513439	RGB	8	600	asm02500000920003001.tif		2013-08-08	2013-08-08	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/273	273	274.jp2	/pamphlets/image/274.jp2

The Garden is best  known as a magnificently landscaped display garden where residents and tourists come to see the  graceful subtropical and tropical plants and to retreat from the rush of Miami. Through its educational  program, a wide range of horticultural classes, lectures, and guided tours are offered year round to  the public. At the research center, scientists and  students work in tropical botany with the Garden's  living collection of plants as one of their principle  resources. In keeping with the Garden's basic purposes, there are other activities in which members  and the public can participate - plant shows, special  plant sales, moonlight tours, and the Ramble, an  annual horticultural fair.  Fairchild Tropical Garden officially opened in  1938. It was founded by Colonel Robert H.  Montgomery, a federal tax authority whose hobby  was plants. The Garden was named after the famous  plant explorer, Dr. David Fairchild, Col. Montgomery's inspiration and close friend. The Garden is  supported through memberships, grants, donations, admissions, and a small endowment. It is operated in cooperation with the Metropolitan Dade  County Park and Recreation Department.  ^-'rr~~^~~~~^J^S^  . gjp _____  \     \  v\  \&lt;\i-  /^  &lt;:  ^^z  tvSf  ■ :^feJ  Highlights of the Garden  PLANT DISPLAY GARDEN: The collections  of palms and cycads at Fairchild Tropical Garden  are among the world's finest, both in quality and  quantity. There are other outstanding collections  here as well, including tropical flowering trees,  aroids, ferns, Bahamian plants, bromeliads, and orchids. Plants with exotic names bring the color of  the world's tropics and subtropics all year long to  the Garden. Baobab {Adansonia digitata), from Africa. Cannon ball (Couroupita guianensis), from  French Guiana. Fire tree (Oreocallis wickhamii),  from Australia. Talipot palm (Corypha umbraculif-  era), from Ceylon. Ponytaii tree (Beaucarnea recur-  vata), from Mexico. These are a few from some 5,000  kinds of plants growing in Fairchild Tropical Garden.  The Garden's plants are labeled for easy identification. The horticultural staff keeps accurate records on each plant, noting the source of the seed  or plant, the date of its planting, its precise location,  its scientific name, and other pertinent information.  SPECIAL FEATURES: The landscape design  of William Lyman Phillips, who worked closely with  Frederick Law Olmstead, is as much the source of  the tropical beauty of the Garden as are the plants  themselves. This design features eleven lakes,  winding paths, and two important vistas with the  plants grouped in informal, flowing patterns. Visitors  to the Garden can see the tropical Rain Forest with  a Fern Glade, the Sunken Garden, the Flowering  Vine Pergola, the Cycad Circle, the Hibiscus Garden, and the Rare Plant House.  Plants indigenous to South Florida, the Florida  Keys, and the Bahamas grow in areas simulating  their native habitats for those interested in natural  history. Plants typical of the Everglades, for example, grow in a specially designed area.  TOURS: A guided tram tour gives visitors an  overview of the Garden's eighty-three acres (34 hectares), providing information on the Garden's history  as well as on the plant collections. Walking tour  guides, available at certain times during the year,  lead the visitor into areas not reached by the tram  and provide more information about specific plants.  School children are given tours by specially trained  guides.  FACILITIES: Fairchild Tropical Garden has an  auditorium which seats 350 persons. It is frequently  used for shows, lectures, and other events. The O.C.  Corbin Education Building is used for classes and  meetings. The Bookshop houses the Palm Museum  and Library as well as its excellent collection of horticultural books for sale. Snacks and drinks are available.  Ju  /  [    •&lt;-  Research and Educational Program  EDUCATION: Fairchild Tropical Garden conducts an active program of education aimed at the  lay person. Courses in horticulture, botany, and allied subjects are offered on a regular basis to the  community. Walking tours of specific plant groups  or areas in the Garden are part of the educational  program. Staff members help the public by identifying plants and by answering questions covering a  wide range of gardening and horticultural problems.  RESEARCH: The Garden's scientific staff contributes significantly to our knowledge of tropical  botany through their research and publications. The  research center and nursery, a mile south of the  public display garden, is the site of the William J.  Robbins Plant Science Building. The research library, the herbarium, and the plant anatomy and  tissue culture laboratories are located here. The herbarium contains some 50,000 dried plant specimens which are used for research and identification  purposes. Work on two floras has contributed to the  size of the herbarium's collection. The James L.  Knight and John S. Knight wing of the Plant Science  Building contains a classroom for advanced  courses in tropical botany.  CONSERVATION: Along with its other collections the Garden is committed to helping perpetuate  rare and endangered plant species of Florida, the  Caribbean, and elsewhere in the tropics. It is a  member garden of the National Center for Plant Conservation.  Fairchild Tropical Garden has a program to maintain a germ plasm collection of superior cultivars of  important tropical fruits. Studies on adaptation of  these fruit trees to South Florida conditions are being  made and clonal material is exchanged worldwide. 		image/tiff						125028615 Bytes	7375	5651	3200017233	RGB	8	600	asm02500000860002001.tif		2013-08-08	2013-08-08	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/302	302	303.jp2	/pamphlets/image/303.jp2

It was begun by the tremendous  enthusiasm of Colonel and Mrs. Robert H. Montgomery for the  idea of a great tropical garden which would celebrate the life  work of Dr. David Fairchild.  From its very beginning it was unique, because it was and  is the only tropical botanical garden on the mainland of the  United States. For all these fifteen years it has been the continuing enthusiasm and the untiring energy of the Montgomerys  which has carried it on. They brought to its service the abilities  and interests of hundreds of people who today are members  and friends and well-wishers for the magnificent thing the  Garden has become.  Now, in the fifteenth year of the Garden, its members  have decided that the appropriate time has come for all of us  to do something for the Montgomerys and therefore for the  Garden. In a way, this will be a secret and a surprise for them.  It will be something about which they will not have done one  single thing, themselves. It will be a fine outpouring of enthusiasm on the part of all the friends everywhere, all over the  world, to show the Montgomerys what we think of this beautiful  and growing thing they have begun.  An anniversary reception is planned for March 23rd, to  celebrate fifteen years of remarkable accomplishment. At that  time a check will be presented to the Montgomerys and Fair-  childs for the Garden —- a fund, raised by us to add our bit to  their achievement. The total amount will be a surprise to them,  although they may know of certain sums given. We expect this  total to overwhelm them.  The Garden is young, and much remains to be planned  and executed. New features, such as avenues of beautiful  trees, new lakes and pools, buildings and other improvements,  might be chosen by individuals to be presented as memorials  or special gifts to bear the name of the donor or the one he  wishes to honor. The gift could be earmarked for these special  purposes, yet included in the Fund.  In order to make this a truly great event in the history of  the Garden, this is our chance to give with enthusiasm. We  want the FIFTEENTH ANNIVERSARY FUND to make the Fair-  childs and the Montgomerys very happy and very proud of  all the friends who have come forward spontaneously to carry  on their great work.  jUt*Ji.to*£T&lt;t to  FMU 		image/tiff						114934452 Bytes	6834	5606	2086441299	RGB	8	600	asm02500000870002001.tif		2013-08-08	2013-08-08	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/309	309	310.jp2	/pamphlets/image/310.jp2

Located on Biscayne  Bay, Morningside was designated  Miami's first Historic District by the  City of Miami Commission on "  December 20,1984.  Morningside was originally known  as Bay Shore and is comprised of  several subdivisions, the first of  which was platted in 1922 and the last  in 1935. Most were subdivided by the  Bay Shore Investment Company,  whose president was John H.Nunnally.  Morningside was envisioned by the  developers as an exclusive residential  neighborhood which would contain  homes of highest character. The  amenities of the area attracted many  "movers and shakers" of the community.  The special character of  Morningside is due in part to the  mixed architectural styles of its  homes and its wide, tree-lined boulevards. The area reflects the eclecticism popular in the early twentieth  century and includes Mediterranean  Revival, Mission, Art Deco, and vernacular style houses. We hope you  will take time to discover the rich  detailing present on many of the  homes, as well as the way in which  other houses utilize local materials,  such as oolitic limestone and tropical decorative motifs. Morningside  features the work of more than forty  well-known local architects, including Kiehnel and Elliott, Marion Man-  ley, and Robert Law Weed.  We would also like you to observe  the many beautiful flowering trees  and foliage that we are fortunate to  have in our neighborhood. We  believe we have a representative  collection of plant material that has  been used in residential landscaping  over the past sixty years.  With so many of the older waterfront neighborhoods being destroyed  by hi-rises and condominiums, it is  important that Morningside be  retained as a remembrance of the  Miami of an earlier era. Judging by  the quality of construction and materials, these sixty year "old" homes  have a good many more years ahead  of them. Their durability stems in  part from the love and care that the  original builders and owners lavished  on them.  In recent years, the homes in  Morningside have become the property of individuals who are striving  to retain the beauty of the original  architecture. We are pleased that  you can share with us the love we  have for a little bit of the past in the  bustling, hectic present.

The dramatic corner tower houses a  3 story staircase with original arched  wooden windows and wrought iron  grills. Constructed in 1925 of hollow  clay tile and Dade county pine, the  floors are red quarry tile and red oak.  The home was designed around a  lovely courtyard with beautiful  columns on the rear porch.  510 N.E. 57th Street  Chick McDowell, owner  Built in 1936, this home features one of Morningside's  more unusual architectural  styles... Colonial Revival;  however, if one looks closely,  some Deco touches can be  found. Its most prominent  features are the main entrance,  including fluted pilasters and  sidelights and the floors of  random oak with pegs. It has  been completely restored/  remodeled by the current  owner.  SH^r*!n  Purchase tickets  and tour starts  here.  53  ST.  3 555 N.E. 58th Street  Here is a hybrid of two architectural  styles popular in South Florida during  the 192 D's and 1930's; Mediterranean  and Mission. Among its aesthetic features are arched windows, interior archways, wrought iron and barrel tile roof.  Each bedroom has its own private bath,  unusual for a home of this period. Fixtures and tile in the bathrooms are original. The pantry/breakfast room has  cabinets of painted pine, typical in  20's homes. Note especially the ceiling  fixtures and original sink. A piece of  whimsy is the flickering light at the base  of the staircase. In the late 1920's the  house became the property of the Trinity Episcopal Cathedral. It was recently  sold to private owners who are in the  process of renovation.  4    5911 N.E. 6th Avenue  Natalie and Karl Thiele, Owners  The streamline look of this Art Deco home is typical of  the popular architectural style in the 1930 's and early  1940's. There is an open spacious feeling throughout  with linear iron balcony and bannister. Second floor  porthole windows and door surround and trim of imitation keystone are special features. The house was  designed by Robert Little and Jorgensen and Schriffler  for W. Lee Martin, an engineer in 1936.  5830 N.E. 6th Court  Dee and Michele James, Owners  This Mediterranean Revival style home  was completed in 1931, remodeled in  1948 and restored in 1983-84. Items of  interest are quarry tile floors, laid in an  intricate pattern, cathedral ceiling in living room and cast coral rock fireplace. A  former owner in the cargo shipping business had the kitchen remodeled by a  ship's carpenter, which incorporated  many unique marine accessories and  masterful wood work. The kitchen was  featured in House Beautiful in 1948.  Current owners have added a walled-in  courtyard with deck, Jacuzzi, outdoor  shower and French doors from the sun  porch to the deck. The pointed archways  begin the transition from the 20's to the  30's. Note also the keystone walkways  and front step.  6     5991 N.E, 6th Court  Maria and Steve Ferguson, owners  Louis and Esther Seitin, residents of Miami from 1912 who had a general  merchandising business on Miami Avenue and 4th Street, had the house built for their  family in the mid 20's. The classic center hallway floor plan is reminiscent of Southern  homes. The long porch on the north side of the home opens to the huge yard.  Especially charmingis the balcony over the entry and the columns. The present  owners have restored much of the home, laboriously removing a sprayed coating  over the exterior and refinishi tig the original wooden windows. This is the only  home in the neighborhood with a basement.  658 N.E. 58th Street  Wendell Brewer and David Lehmann, Owners  This home was designed in 1936 by William Shanklin and is a  combination of Art Deco and Mission. Of special interest is the  turret entry and archways that are the Deco Step design. The  split plan was a new feature in bungalows of the 30 's. Note the  tile and oak hardwood floors, as well as the sunken living room  with cathedral ceiling and ornate fireplace with flower and bird  images.  lour a collection of homes from  the 1920's &lt;Sz 1930's and discover   the Miami of an earlierera!  fy^  %/3&gt;&lt;/90 		image/tiff						208911756 Bytes	10274	6778	67539354	RGB	8	600	asm02500001340003001.tif		2013-08-08	2013-08-08	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/333	333	334.jp2	/pamphlets/image/334.jp2

Carved detail from a Seventeenth century  Spanish chest from the collection of George  E. Merrick, founder of Coral Gables.  THE MUSEUM collections cover every  period of regional history, old and new;  from prehistoric Indian tools to the Project Mercury nosecone recovery net; from  Seminole Dugouts to Rex E. Bassett Jr.'s  invention of the automatic washer; from  the pioneer materials of Henry M. Flagler, the Brickells, Sewells, Carl G.  Fisher and George E. Merrick to antique  radio equipment and the history of Pan  American World Airways.  The museum library is always  available for research and its array of regional  and historical  books and archival material  have been the  source of information to journalists  and writers. The  photographic collection at the museum is the largest in this area and includes the collections of such pioneer  photographers as Richard B. Hoit and  Claude C. Matlack. This enormous collection is available without cost to the taxpayer, since this Museum receives no  tax support from any governmental  agency, state, local or national.  This region has been given a remarkable  opportunity  to  preserve  a  really  complete record of its history while affording its collections to serve as a  major cultural asset to the area.

Get ready to explore a wilderness quite unlike  anything anyone in America has ever seen before.  Where Bengal tigers run free around the ruins  of a temple that's an exact replica of one that was discovered deep in the jungles of Asia. Occupied only  by tigers.  Where you walk into a mysterious man-made  cave and come face to face with an orangutan, separated only by an inch or so of clear, unbreakable glass.  Where zebras graze in splendid silence on plains  that look like a slice of Africa's Serengetti. While  their eternal predators, the lions, loom menacingly  in the background, separated from their traditional  meal by giant moats.  A zoo with a new point of view.  The 25 acre, 12 exhibit preview center of the new  Metrozoo will give you a brief, but beautiful idea of  what the full Metrozoo will be like when completed.  The animals are displayed in realistic habitats and  natural relationships as they appear in the wild. At  the Metrozoo you will discover them in the continents  where they live. The wildlife from Africa will be  observed separate from the wildlife of Asia, so  that the animals may exist much as they do  in their native environment. And  viewers will have a better  opportunity to see and  understand the natural relationship that exists among  the various species as they are found in Nature. You  will leave Metrozoo with the feeling that you have  visited another continent.  There's plenty to see and do  here right now.  When you enter the Metrozoo Preview Center, you'll  pass by a massive rock and waterfall display that sets  the stage for your journey to Europe, Asia and Africa.  Monkeys.  There's the Gibbon and Siamang Exhibit where  you can take a seat and watch apes make monkeys  of themselves.  There's that intriguing cave where you can gaze  through glass at orangutans that are either gazing  right back or going about their business unaware of  your presence.  There's a 1500 seat^^Lj| amphitheatre where you  can see special ^^30m^   presentations that are  both entertaining and  educational. And get  a stunning view of what the scope  of the new Metrozoo will be like when  it's completed.  There's Lemur Island. And plains  animals such as zebra, wildebeest, and  black buck running free.  Tigers.  The first exhibits open July 4,1980 and include  that terrifically detailed Tiger Temple that looks like  it's straight out of an old jungle movie starring Sabu.  Where 300 pound Bengal tigers leap, and climb  about with menacing grace.  The November 1980 expansion includes 8 more  exhibits. The Malayan Tapir. And Sambar Deer. And  Malayan Sun Bear. And Kangaroos. And Yellow  Back Duiker. And Baird'sTapir. And Maxwell Duiker,  the smallest true antelopes in the world.  And much, much more  is on the way.  By July of 1981, the Metrozoo will have expanded  to 160 acres, with still 39 more exhibits.  And by July of 1982, it will have reached its full  size—260 acres—making it the largest viewer display  zoo in the United States.  Get a preview now of what  the world will be coming to see.  There can be no doubt that the new Metrozoo  will become one of Florida's largest and most  popular tourist attractions.  There will be nothing else like it in Florida. And  very few like it in the world. And, perhaps, no other  zoo anywhere will combine the open space feeling of  the wilderness with spectacular man-made features  that create the romance and flavor of your own  personal safari.  Everything you need to enjoy a  great day is here right now.  There's plenty of free parking.  There are camera supplies, unique gifts and very  special souvenirs at the gift shop, and refreshments at  the Zebrazaar. 		image/tiff						158533407 Bytes	9659	5471	655578572	RGB	8	600	asm02500001250002001.tif		2013-08-08	2013-08-08	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/339	339	340.jp2	/pamphlets/image/340.jp2

The Zoological Society's dedication to Metro-  zoo is both philosophical and practical. We  support the zoo's commitment to education,  conservation, research and recreation. And  because a zoo cannot survive on ideals alone,  we generate funds through individual and  corporate sponsorships for programs in these  areas. The money we raise is also used to  acquire exotic and endangered species  and to finance major projects.  Wings of Asia, Metrozoo's nationally  renowned 172-acre aviary, with over 300  tropical Southeast Asian birds, is one of those  projects.  Another vitally important undertaking  sponsored by the Zoological Society is  Metrozoo's state-of-the-art animal clinic. In  addition, the Society sponsors a variety of  programs such as "Adopt An Animal," which  helps to defray the animals' food bills.  This is only the beginning for Metrozoo.  And the projects we've mentioned are just a  few from an endless list. Please join us in our  efforts.Your moral and financial support will  truly help over the years as Miami Metrozoo  becomes one of the world's outstanding zoos.  Miami Metrozoo is easy to find  and easy to get to!  We're just 12 minutes from Dadeland Mall and  about 20 minutes from Miami International  Airport. From U.S. 1, take SW. 152nd Street west  3 miles to the Metrozoo entrance. From the  turnpike, take the SW 152nd Street exit west and  follow the Metrozoo signs.

Our early  settlers lived off the land, and their first  industries utilized local plant resources.  Dr. Morton is Director of the Morton  Collectanea at the University of Miami  and author of many publications of a  botanical nature.

We are committed to continuing the Greater Miami  Opera's superb tradition of presenting an ensemble  company featuring the stars of the opera world today  and the young artists who will be the stars of tomorrow.  Our productions have been created by some of the most  brilliant designers of our time, and will range from  ancient Crete after the Trojan  War to Japan at the turn of the  century.

As you would expect in an opera entitled The  Troubadour, there is great music throughout Verdi's  colorful score, including the famous Anvil Chorus.  // Trovatore has thrilled operagoers for more than a century  with its tale of brothers separated at birth who, neither knowing the other's identity, become bitter enemies in politics and  romance. Verdi adds further layers of drama by casting one brother  as a nobleman, the other as a troubadour, and the exotic life of the  gypsies adds to the aura of mystery.  Stunning arias, duets, and ensembles give us the opportunity  to introduce to Miami audiences a powerful cast, including the acclaimed young Verdi soprano Silvia Mosca as Leonora. Miss Mosca  is familiar to Metropolitan Opera audiences  and now joins us in this first production  of the season, conducted by the Greater  Miami Opera's Artistic Director Willie  Anthony Waters.  Underwritten in part by  The Verdi Society, Mr. and Mrs. Joseph E.  Crawley, Founders  Dr. and Mrs. Maxwell Dauer  S     T  International Series  Silvia Mosca Leonora  Barbara Conrad Azucena  Robert McFarland.. Count di Luna  Willie Anthony Waters ..Conductor  Matthew Lata Stage Director  Nicola Benois Set Designer  Charles R. Caine Costume  Designer  STATE OF THE ART TECHNOLOGY...  PROJECTED ENGLISH TITLES  JANUARY 15-21,1990  Idomeneo mum,  WOLFGANG AMADEUS MOZART  Wolfgang  Amadeus Mozart  is considered by  many to be the greatest  composer who ever lived. The film  Amadeus certainly confirmed him  as today's most popular composer.  Following the success of last year's  Le Nozze di Figaro, we are pleased  to present the Florida premiere of  Idomeneo, which tells a story of  love and reconciliation in the after-  international Series ^ Qf ^ ^ m ^^  KS::::::::!!T5 by Artistic Director Willie Anthony  Susan Quittmeyer idamante Waters, this production features  SSSSm'.VmS Miami-trained tenor Curtis Rayam  Michael Hampe... stage Director as Idomeneo, a role which he sang  Martin Rupprecht .... Proto     a{ ^ g^^g pestiva| rep|acing  Luciano Pavarotti and, repeating her i  highly acclaimed portrayal of the Trojan princess Ilia at the Metropolitan Opera, Miami's own Marvis Martin. We have invited the internationally renowned stage director, Michael Hampe to recreate this  Mozart masterpiece. Dr. Hampe is known for his dynamic productions at the Salzburg Festival, La Scala, and the San Francisco  Opera. Idomeneo promises to be one of the great discoveries for  South Florida music lovers next year.  Underwritten in part by  (S) Southern Bell  The Young Patronesses of the Opera  FEBRUARY 12-18,1990  IlBarbiere  DlSlVIGLIA  GIOACHINO ROSSINI  Even as a young man, the composer Gioachino Rossini had a  sharp sense of human folly. Nowhere is that more evident than in  this rollicking comedy, which takes a lighthearted view of love while  it pokes good-natured fun at old fools.  The Barber of Seville contains some of opera's most delightful  and memorable music, and here opera lovers will recognize many of  the characters from Mozart's Le Nozze di Figaro. Figaro is the town  barber of the opera's title, who schemes to help Rosina marry the  young Count Almaviva.  Jake Gardner, last season's nimble Figaro in Le Nozze di Figaro,  continues his manipulations as Rossini's Figaro. Kathleen  Kuhlmann, who thrilled audiences in our production of Rossini's  Bianca e Falliero two years ago, returns as the charming yet cunning  Rosina. She will be joined by both  t veteran singer-actor Carlos Feller  as Doctor Bartolo, and another  Miami favorite, Richard Buckley, who  will be on the podium to conduct  this splendid example of Italian  'opera buffa'.  Underwritten in part by  © TEXACO  International Series  Kathleen Kuhlmann Rosina  Jake Gardner Figaro  Carlos Feller Dr. Bartolo  Richard Buckley Conductor  Sandra SachwitzBernhard .. Stage  Director  MARCH 12-18,1990 ft  VINCENZO BEL1 ,M'^*  Vincenzo Bellini was one of the most admired composers of his  age, a time when the most prominent vocal style was called  simply "bel canto' or 'beautiful song; and Norma is one of  the greatest examples of this beautiful and brilliant style.  Chopin, Wagner, and Liszt all admired Bellini's music,  and now you have a chance to admire it as well when  we present the Miami premiere of what has been  called "the quintessential opera".  Soprano Carol Neblett returns to Miami in the demanding title role of Norma, the High Priestess of the Druids.  She and her people are struggling against the rule of the  Roman Empire, and the mystical setting and the love-hate  relationships provide many wonderful opportunities for the  vocal pyrotechnics that made Bellini so famous. With the resurgence of interest in 'bel canto' over the past few decades,  no opera has been more popular than Norma. It will be directed and designed by the highly acclaimed team that created last season's production of Wagner's Die Walkure, Bliss  Hebert and Allen Charles Klein.  International Series  Carol Neblett Norma  Jeffrey Wells Oroveso  Willie Anthony Waters ..Conductor  Bliss Hebert Stage Director  Allen Charles Klein.. Set Designer  John Lehmeyer Costume  Designer  Greater Miami Opera  APRIL 23-29,1990  Madama  Mtterfly  GIACOMO PUCCINI ^  Culture clashes are nothing new to opera, but few composers  have so masterfully conveyed tragedy in intercultural romance as  Puccini did in Madama Butterfly. Surprisingly, Butterfly was a total  failure when it premiered in 1904, but today it is surely one of the  most popular operas by any composer.  Madama Butterfly is one of those works of universal appeal that  seems fresh and new each time it is performed. One of the greatest  Butterflys of our time, Renata Scotto, will utilize her vast experience  in the role when she returns to Miami as the  stage director for this refined and beauti-  ul masterpiece. Maria Spacagna makes  her Greater Miami Opera debut as  Cio-Cio-San, a role which earned  her wide acclaim last season at La  Scala. The winner of the 1986 Fifth  Worldwide Madame Butterfly Competition, Vyacheslav Polozov, who made his  Greater Miami Opera debut last season as  Don Alvaro in La Forza del Destino, returns as  the handsome Pinkerton. With this world-renowned  cast, and sets by a Miami favorite, Allen Charles  Klein, Madama Butterfly promises to be an appropriately grand conclusion to a grand season of the  Greater Miami Opera.

Located on Biscayne  Bay, Morningside was designated  Miami's first Historic District by the  City of Miami Commission on  December 20,1984.  Morningside was originally known  as Bay Shore and is comprised of  several subdivisions, the first of  which was platted in 1922 and the last  in 1935. Most were subdivided by the  Bay Shore Investment Company,  whose president was John H.Nunnally.  Morningside was envisioned by the  developers as an exclusive residential  neighborhood which would contain  homes of highest character. The  amenities of the area attracted many  "moversandshakers" of the community.  The special character of  Morningside is due in part to the  mixed architectural styles of its  homes and its wide, tree-lined boulevards. The area reflects the eclecticism popular in the early twentieth  century and includes Mediterranean  Revival, Mission, Art Deco, and vernacular style houses. We hope you  will take time to discover the rich  detailing present on many of the  homes, as well as the way in which  other houses utilize local materials,  such as oolitic limestone and tropical decorative motifs. Morningside  features the work of more than forty  well-known local architects, including Kiehnel and Elliott, Marion Man-  ley, and Robert Law Weed.  We would also like you to observe  the many beautiful flowering trees  and foliage that we are fortunate to  have in our neighborhood. We  believe we have a representative  collection of plant material that has  been used in residential landscaping  over the past sixty years.  With so many of the older waterfront neighborhoods being destroyed  by hi-rises and condominiums, it is  important that Morningside be  retained as a remembrance of the  Miami of an earlier era. Judging by  the quality of construction and materials, these sixty year "old" homes  have a good many more years ahead  of them. Their durability stems in  part from the love and care that the  original builders and owners lavished  on them.  In recent years, the homes in  Morningside have become the property of individuals who are striving  to retain the beauty of the original  architecture. We are pleased that  you can share with us the love we  have for a little bit of the past in the  bustling, hectic present. 		image/tiff						102515236 Bytes	5144	6642	1822868801	RGB	8	600	asm02500001190002001.tif		2013-08-08	2013-08-08	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/370	370	371.jp2	/pamphlets/image/371.jp2

The current owners have let the kitchen remain ''primitive" — no dishwasher, no microwave, no  garbage disposal. Note the imposing stairwell window, the pickled  Dade County pine woodwork, and the recently marbleized  fireplace.  2 679 N.E. 58th Street  Fritz & Nell Kreis  Built in 1937 by Harold D. Steward, this house is sited on a walled  half acre and is an early example of monolithic slab construction.  Noteworthy features are the fireplace, Cuban tile floors, and  tile work in upstairs bathrooms. The second floor bedrooms  have cathederal ceilings and views of the side garden and fountain. Restoration in progress.  ^ 5724 N. Bayshore Drive  Ed & Margaret Horner  Built in 1936. T. Tripp Russell was the architect of this fine example  of Art Deco or Streamline Moderne residence. The "streamline"  influence is felt in the horizontal lines of the building, emphasized  by its bands of colored keystone, its rounded corners, and pipe  railing details. The rose terrazo, various levels from room to  room, and dramatic staircase are typical of the Art Deco period.  A  5940 N.E. 6th Court  Clay & Ellen Cude  Built in 1924. Rare Mayan palms compliment the lush tropical  setting for this charming Spanish Mission home. One of the  oldest in Morningside, it features an exquisite French-style  fireplace, multi-level floorplan, high ceilings, archways,  original oak floors, and a staircase tower to the upper level.  There, you can enjoy glimpses of Biscayne Bay, morning  sunrises and gentle bay breezes on the second floor balcony off  the unique study.  T  our a collection of homes from  the 1920's 611930's and discover  the Miami of an earlierera!  Purchase tickets  and tour starts  here.  N.E.  C 5978 N.E. 6th Court  Alan & Bonnie Weisberg  Built in 1926 by Samuel Steussy for his wife and six children,  utilizing the finest materials and techniques known. The lower  floor has ten foot ceilings, with nine foot ceilings upstairs.  Floors are double decked and finished in New York state red  oak. Exterior walls are hollow red clay tile block, windows and  frames are Honduras mahogany. Imported tiles are used throughout. Note the French country kitchen, considered by many to be  the focal point of this magnificent home.  592 N.E. 60th Street  The Cushman School  Built in 1926. The Cushman School was founded by Dr. Laura  Cushman in 1924 and is the oldest private elementary school in  continuous operation in Dade. The two story Mediterranean  Revival and Mission style administration and classroom building  was designed by Russell Skipton as a two wing, "V" shaped  building so the classrooms would have cross ventilation and  take maximum advantage of the bay breezes. In 1984 the Cushman School was designated an historic structure by the City of  Miami's Heritage Conservation Board.  7 5932 N.E. 6th Avenue  Peter & Veronica Fuchs  Built in 1927. A notable feature of this house is the use of native  oolitic limestone on the chimney, balcony, and entrance. The  original windows in the home attest to the fact that the cypress  used in the wooden portions of this residence was a "lasting  choice". Notice the tile floors with a different design in each  room. Fred W. Bell of the Columbia Tire Company built this  house, the current family is the only other to have occupied it.  x^.**'*   ^*A* 		image/tiff						206298471 Bytes	10259	6703	1068932661	RGB	8	600	asm02500001190003001.tif		2013-08-08	2013-08-08	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/371	371	372.jp2	/pamphlets/image/372.jp2

The Historical Museum is the major project of the Historical Association of Southern Florida. The permanent  chronological exhibit traces man's historic experience in South Florida over a period often thousand years,  through the use of written words, graphic reproductions, photographs, artifacts and audio presentations.  Temporary exhibits which change regularly spotlight historical topics of special interest.  A program of guided tours of the Historical Museum for school children is one of the important  services provided by the Tequestans, volunteers in service to the Association.  The new Historical Museum scheduled to be completed in 1981, will be a major component of the Dade County  Cultural Complex now being planned for downtown Miami. Also housing the Center for the Fine Arts and the Main  Branch ot the Miami-Dade Public Library system, this complex will be a focal point for the visual and intellectual  resources in the Miami area. The new Museum will contain two floors of exhibits, the Tebeau Library, collection storage  and exhibit preparation areas, a gift shop, and administrative offices for the Association. 		image/tiff						162274860 Bytes	5591	9674	1496926964	RGB	8	600	asm02500001060001001.tif		2013-08-08	2013-08-08	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/391	391	392.jp2	/pamphlets/image/392.jp2

It also is shaped by an  awareness of the crucial need for residents and visitors to better understand the significant role South Florida  has played in the history of the nation: before there was Jamestown, there was St. Augustine; before there was a  landing at Plymouth Rock, there was one at the mouth of the Miami River. Founded in 1940 by the late George  Merrick and a small group of historically minded citizens, the Association first opened a Library and Museum  in 1962 and moved to its present location in the Vizcaya complex in 1972. Its goals are to provide education,  enlightenment and entertainment for the people of Southern Florida and the thousands who visit the area  each year. The subject matter is one of intense interest: the growth, development and human dynamics of one  of the most magnetic and attractive regions in the United States. The tools are exhibits, scholarly research,  tours, lectures, publications, programs of outreach and visitation, and inclusion in an exciting quest: to gain a  clearer understanding of South Florida's past, and through that understanding to gain some perception of  what its future might well be. The Association welcomes all like-minded men and women who live or visit in  South Florida to join in this quest. Access is through membership and active participation in the programs of  the Historical Association of Southern Florida.  .before there was Jamestown, there was St. Augustine  A Comparative Timetable of History  DATE  FLORIDA EVENTS  AMERICAN EVENTS  WORLD EVENTS  2000 B.C.

Lots to see. Lots to do.  A camera shop, cafeteria, free baby  strollers that look like miniature Flippers.  Non-stop shows that go on all day long,  Cha-Cha does it April does it.  And so do Dancer and Bee Bee.  Up at the Top Deck are the original Miami  Dolphins. A whole team of them. They  frisk, they romp, they dance, they clap,  they whistle. They play basketball, leap  through hoops, steal cigarettes from their  trainer's mouth. You'll cheer them, laugh  at them. And that's the fun of the  Seaquarium.  Lost Island. It's out of this world. Toby, the grandpa  of turtles, turns up his big brown eyes at you...and  you'd swear another Extra-Terrestrial had landed.  He lumbers up on land and sends a pink ibis running  for shelter. The lazy American crocodile yawns and  shows an acre of teeth to the triggerfish. Lost Island.  Where endangered birds live in safe sanctuary.  You'll get an education. And love it  ¥  # • •  1*  m   #   *   •  Now you see him. Now you don't That's because there's      (  magic at the Golden Dome, and zany Salty's at the heart  of it. One minute he's frisking on stage with his sealion  buddies. The next minute he's gone. Where? Who knows!  (But you can be sure he'll pop up from somewhere for  the next show.)  Then, too, if you're  lucky, you might be  called on to play  games with a sealion.  And get kissed as  a thank you.  i  mm  Introducing Flipper,  star of 100 TV shows!  Even though he's a superstar of TV  and movies, fame hasn't gone to  Flipper's head. He still plays  football and soccer like one of the  guys. He pals around with his  dolphin playmates, Hollywood  and Dawn, rescues his trainer  from a burning house. And if that  weren't enough reason to love  him, he's just plain cute.

The Port of Miami,  with its cruise ships departing  daily for exotic ports of call is just  across the bridge. Miamarina  is more than just a place to  berth a yacht, charter a  fishing boat or take a sightseeing  cruise. It's a place to come and  enjoy a day. Or evening. It's part  of the fun that is Miami.  The newest  thing on  the water. And  it s in  downtown  Miami.  For information and rates write:  Dockmaster, Miamarina  333 Miamarina Parkway Drive, Miami, Fla. 33132  Telephone 377-5407  New.

Then, there are the sightseeing  The docking facility features 208 berths capable of  accommodating yachts of all sizes up to 120' in  length and 9' in draft. Facilities include instant  telephone service, 110 or 220 volt electric power,  sparkling clean restrooms and showers, 24 hour  security watch and dockmaster personnel who  pride themselves on their service. And the  rates are very reasonable as  befitting a municipal  marina. And it's here that the  famed deep-sea fishing  fleet is anchored. With a  direct channel leading to  the Gulf Stream and the  big game fish, Miami is  a year 'round haven for  fishermen. In addition to  the luxury sportsfisher-  men, there are large party  boats that bring in lots  of big fish. For very little.  For those who like their  boats.  They take  visitors on tours  through the area's  residential islands. Or  out into the ocean  where the wonders of  reef life can be seen through glass  bottom boats.  But if boats and fishing and sightseeing  aren't for you, you can still enjoy Miamarina.  It's one of the best places to eat in all of Miami.  On the upper  level of the  magnificent  steel and glass  structure is  The Promenade. It's elegant.   Below,  The Landings. Informal dining. And from the lounge, a view  through the portholes of the boats, docks and the people.

He was  looking for the Fountain of Youth but found only fierce Indians. De Soto lands in 1541 and goes all the way to the Mississippi.  i f III  I ti  Slowly America is settled and the time for freedom come: Boston Harbor a Tea Pot tonight, a new Flag, a last Battle at  Yorktown. Meet Franklin, Jefferson and later Francis Scott Key, Jackson and Corsair Laffite at New Orleans in 1815.  Remember the Alamo? The West is won but a Civil War divides the Country. Meet Lee, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis,  Lincoln and Grant. Passing Teddy Roosevelt and Adm.

To provide the independent living they deserve,  enjoying true American standards.  MIAMI'S SOLUTION  The Miami Housing Authority, operated by a Board of  Commissioners, composed of local citizens serving without compensation, is attempting to meet this challenge.  Over 800 attractive apartments especially designed  for Senior Citizens brighten the prospects of suitable  housing.  HOUSING PLUS  The Miami Housing Authority constructed Donn  Gardens, N. W. 28 Street and 18 Avenue, in January  1961. This was the first low cost housing for the  elderly in the southeastern region of the U.S. There  are 25 efficiencies and 39 one bedroom apartments.  The Authority purchased and is remodeling 288 two  story, one bedroom apartments in 5 locations between  S. W. 2 and 8 Avenues and S. W. 4 and 10 Streets.  MEMBERS AND VOLUNTEERS  ATTENDING LUNCHEON  PROGRAM AT MALCOLM ROSS  SENIOR DAY CENTER ,  _/  Now open are the new two story Abe Aronovitz Villas,  containing 39 efficiencies and 16 one bedroom apartments, opposite Donn Gardens on N. W. 28 Street.  Jollivette Plaza, N. W. 25 Avenue and 64 Street, is  a four acre tract containing 30 efficiencies and 36 one  bedroom apartments for the Negro elderly.  Day center activities are part of each area, to provide  leisure time activities. The site, transportation, community facilities, shopping, health requirements, safety  and personal needs are basic considerations in the  physical and social planning for the elderly.  ELIGIBILITY  Applicants must be residents of the State of Florida  for one year, the last six months spent in Dade County,  except for Veterans.  Elderly applicants must be 62 years of age or over.  Applicants must be within prescribed income limits.  Income may be from Social Security, pensions and  welfare grants, employment or other sources, or any  combination of these.

Because it entertains  with shows, exhibits, a petting zoo, and  elephant rides while allowing you to admire  animals at their proudest and most free,  without the barriers of conventional zoos.  The artistic signs at each display will tell  you about each animal. You may even see  animals you didn't know existed, like our  rare white Bengal tigers.  WE'VE MAPPED OUT YOUR  ADVENTURE.  On the inside of this brochure is a complete  map of Metrozoo. One glance and you'll  appreciate how huge the Miami  Metrozoo really is, and why  it's the most popular attraction in South Florida.  Don't miss seeing it. It's wild!

ENDANGERED   THREATENED RARE COMMON  HOW TO READ OUR PICTOGRAPHS.  Metrozoo's hand-crafted, ceramic pictograph signs were designed by staff artists. Take a look at them  before you see the animals in each display. They'll show you what you need to know about our animals -even  if you don't read a word they say. Through visual interpretive symbols, they describe where each animal lives,  what it eats, what time of day it's most active, and the survival status of its species. At the orangutan exhibit,  for example, the pictographs will tell you that orangutans live in tropical rain forests, eat fruits and berries,  are active during the day, and are an endangered species.  Because Metrozoo is always growing and changing, some of the animals you see during your visit may differ from those on the map, or may be temporarily  placed outside their natural zoogeographic region. r U\/jt^ "\  Grant's Zebra  EMU  FOOD, DRINK  AND GIFTS  (YELLOW DOT ON MAP)  RESTROOMSAND  WATER FOUNTAINS  (RED DOT ON MAP) 		image/tiff						319845100 Bytes	9760	10923	652690864	RGB	8	600	asm02500001350003001.tif		2013-08-08	2013-08-08	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/437	437	438.jp2	/pamphlets/image/438.jp2

In Miami every May when the' 'World of Miami" becomes the  theme for the City of Miami's International Festival, now in its  14th succesful year. It's a time when more than 70 nationality  ethnic groups from many lands demonstrate the songs, dances,  arts, stories, crafts and foods of their natives lands or cultures.  A tribute to Miami's position as the "New World Center" is the  fact that many governments of the world are now sending their  official folkloric ballets and crafts to the Miami International  Festival.

Glass enclosed.  If your stay is of short duration, this is the only and  logical way to study and see this wonderful, gay, and  captivating city. You have no conception of the beauty  and marvelous scenery until you have made a circuit of  the Magic City aboard the "Seminole Queen" via the  Miami River and Inland Waterways. You can gain a  comprehensive idea of this great trip only by utilizing  the "Seminole Scenic Route," which will enable you to  visualize clearly the attractions of Miami and its environments.  Leaving the City Yacht Basin, we enter beautiful Bay  Biscayne. Cruising south along the shore of Bayfront  Park, we view Miami's magnificent skyline.  As we continue up the Miami River, a Venice-like  waterway, we pass and view many palatial yachts and  houseboats lining the shores. Mammoth cranes and  bridges can be seen in operation. This trip is close to  shore, picturesque, interesting and educational.  Our trip now takes us up the north fork of the Miami  River, a few miles out of the large and pulsing city, to  Musa Isle. The "Seminole Queen" is the only boat  stopping at this point. We dock, alight and relax. Here  we visit the Indian Curio Shop, Alligator Farm, Museum,  Exotic Gardens, etc.  ALLIGATOR  Seminole Scenic Route  The Trip with an Attraction  A Partial List of Points of Interest  BISCAYNE BAY  BAYFRONT PARK  BAND SHELL  MIAMI SKY LINE  MIAMI RIVER  BRICKELL POINT  FORT DALLAS SECTION  DRAW BRIDGES  COUNTY COURT HOUSE  FISHING DOCKS  BOAT LIVERIES  INDUSTRIES  FORT DALLAS  LUMMUS PARK  SCOTTISH RITE TEMPLE  SALEM INN  SEYBOLD CANAL  SNUG HARBOR  U.S.  NAVAL  STATION  SHIP YARDS  MIAMI  COUNTRY  CLUB  RESIDENTIAL SECTION  DURHAM PARK  tLAWRENCE PARK  SOUTH FORK MIAMI  RIVER  YACHT STORAGE  HOUSE BOATS  RIVER BARGES  TUG BOATS  PRIVATE YACHTS  JUST CANAL  NORTH FORK MIAMI  RIVER  MUSA ISLE  .8  2  a  H  W  o  INDIAN VILLAGE  ALLIGATOR FARM  ZOO — MUSEUM  TROPICAL GARDENS  RARE PLANTS—TREES  BAMBOO — PALMS  ALLIGATOR WRESTLING  TROPICAL BIRDS  MONKEYS  ^TRADING POST  TOTAL ADMISSION to MUSA ISLE  Sixty Cents  NO OTHER ADMISSIONS OR EXTRA CHARGES  Alligator Wrestling Each Trip  Large De Luxe Double Deck Boats  GLASS ENCLOSED — DIESEL POWER  Rest  Rooms       •       Refreshments  Government Inspected—Marine Insurance  For Reservations See Your Hotel Clerk or    4%   AA|rt  Travel Agent, or Phone Main Ticket Office    O-/•«**  THREE TRIPS DAILY AND SUNDAY  DEPARTS 10:30 A.M.  2:00 P.

North  America has no native monkeys, but  in our natural South Florida  hammock there live over 500  primates, most running free in a 20  acre reserve. Since its conception in  1933, Monkey Jungle's philosophy  that animals should be displayed in  natural habitats, has been widely  and avidly accepted by many  zoological institutions nationwide.  Our vast collection includes  monkeys and apes from Asia,  Europe, South America, and Africa.  It is now one of the few protected  habitats for endangered primate  species in the U.S.  From the protection of caged  walkways, visitors can walk with  perfect safety into the heart of the  monkey's domain. Members of the  Java monkey colony immediately  welcome the visitor entering our  jungle. The Java monkey is a skillful  skin diver in the wilds of its native  coastal home, Malaysia, and  scheduled feedings at Monkey  Jungle show off these underwater  talents as monkeys dive into their  pool for special foods.  Monkey Jungle also features a  beautiful five acre Amazonian  Rainforest to display some of South  America's primates. The hundreds of  trees, ferns, and palms were hand  collected and brought back to South  florida so that a perfect jungle  recreation could be realized as the  home of many colorful and  intriguing primate species.  Scheduled shows in this section  lure these monkeys from the depths  of the jungle so that visitors may  observe and photograph them  close-up.

For several months industrious committees have been at work  arranging details for the biggest and best Legion convention  ever staged. Everything is in readiness and you may safely  anticipate the most thrilling and pleasurable event of a lifetime.  In addition to the gayer pleasures of whoopee and wassail  there will be football, baseball, bathing beauty contests, polo,  boating, sailing and speed boat regattas, wrestling, boxing and  hunting, as well as golf, tennis, fishing, archery, trap shooting  and bowling tournaments, for which attractive cash prizes and  trophies have been provided.  MIAMI   -   City  of  Palms  crlVhere the Coconuts Grow9  Miami is located down among the palms on the eastern sea-  coast at the southernmost tip of the Florida peninsula. It is  the metropolis of the only continental tropics in North  America.  To the east is the mysterious Gulf Stream, skirting endless  miles of glistening beach. To the west are the Everglades,  America's last frontier, home of the Seminole Indian, the ibis,  the heron and the alligator. To the north is ^ vast land where  people grow weary of work and wintry blasts and long to  play in the land of eternal springtime. To the south extend  air and sea lanes to Havana, Panama, Rio and Romance.  Miami is truly a city of magic; a magic that lures like the  lotus blossom but gives youth and health and vitality to her  worshipers. Many have said "it's Worth a war to have a rendezvous with this queen of the southern seas."  Whether you come by plane, train, ship, bus or Hispana-Fliv-  ver, you will find the trip a short and interesting prelude to  the pleasures which await you here. Transportation costs, as  your local ticket agent will tell you, have been cut in half.  Upon arrival you will find 350 hotels and more than 1500  apartment buildings prepared for your comfort and convenience. The highest price a Legionnaire can pay, two in a  room, is $3.50 per day. That room will overlook beautiful  Biscayne Bay or the Atlantic Ocean. Other rooms, with vistas  of palms, waterways and tropical foliage, range downward  to 75c.  Eood is good and meals the price you pay at home. Refreshments are the best in the United States, bar none, and even  moie reasonable.

Bring  your summer togs, bathing suit, golf clubs, tennis racquet, and  other sports equipment. Leave your fishing tackle at home.  It would be ineffectual against our deep sea fighters and besides, the charter boats, about 300 of them, provide all necessary equipment. Practically all sports facilities will be free to  registered Legionnaires.

Here, in your own country,  is a Riviera of your own, with all the gay allurements  of foreign resorts, plus the good old comforts of home!  A land rich in tropical beauty, sunny health and moonlit romance—the American South Seas, just a few  hours distant!  That's one reason vacationists are thronging southward to the Cities of the Sun, Mecca of outdoor sport -  dom—and they're coming early, too!  Prices With a Scotch Accent  Another reason: Last winter's residents, thousands  of them, found that living costs in the Miami area are  just as reasonable as stay-at-home expenses. In fact,  costs are less if fuel and clothing economies are considered.  With greater hotel and apartment accommodations  than any other similar resort in the world (350 hotels,  more than 1,500 apartment buildings and approximately 5,000 furnished cottages, bungalows and sumptuous villas)—enough to house 150,000 visitors without overcrowding!—-Miami and Miami Beach offer an  amazing variety of home facilities, from a room to  an estate, at a wide range of economical rates.  Inexpensive Pleasures  A third reason for this early winter migration: People have found they can have a better time here than  anywhere else, that there's always something interesting to enjoy and that it doesn't put a crimp in your  pocketbook to indulge your pastime moods. Whatever your hobby, whether collecting beer labels or  polo ponies, it's here for you to ride.  Of course, the longer you stay, the less the proportionate cost of your vacation. Savings in fuel and  clothing costs are appreciable when an entire winter  in the North is eliminated. Low pre-season and postseason rentals help reduce the daily average of living  costs. 		image/tiff						79276605 Bytes	4809	5495	493331007	RGB	8	600	asc99990000280005001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/484	484	485.jp2	/pamphlets/image/485.jp2

Pullman rates were made commen-  surately modest also.  Not only in fares but in running-time important reductions have become operative. You can now travel  by through train from New York to Miami, on regular schedule, in 28 hours; from Boston in 35 hours,  15 minutes; from Chicago in 42 hours.  On these Miami-bound trains you are coddled in luxurious comfort, with many little extra services not offered in ordinary travel.  The Florida East Coast Railway, operating modern  oil-burning locomotives, provides double-track service  to Miami, connecting with every important city in the  country. Fast schedules are maintained over this route.  The Seaboard Air Line Railway also provides rapid  transportation between Miami and other sections of the  country, as well as a direct route to Tampa and the  Florida West Coast.  Winging South in a Day  Already operative are the new airplane services—  two planes daily plying the airways between New York  and Miami, Chicago and Miami, with convenient airway connections from St. Louis.  Each trip is accomplished in the daylight hours of  one day. For instance, it is now customary to take off  from New York after breakfast via Eastern Air Transport lines and arrive in this cheerful land of palms in  time for a swim and an appetizer before dinner.  Plans for overnight plane service are expected to  materialize this season. You'll go to bed in winter  and wake up in the bright blaze of Florida sunshine.  Air travel costs have been adjusted downward until  now you can skim in comfort and safety to Miami  Beach and Miami for approximately the price of railroad fare plus Pullman accommodations. Business  men of the North can establish their winter homes in  this sunny contentment and commute between business  and family over the week-ends.  above : When Mr. Tarpon, the Silver King, starts  going places!

P  B Y   Al RWAYS  Gateway to South America  Once here, you are within a couple hours flight of  Havana, most exhilarating and beautiful of Latin-  America's cities, and Nassau, quaint capital of the Bahamas. Here is the gateway to South America, the  West Indies and Central America—directly connected  by air routes to 32 countries and colonies.  Across the Caribbean sea, over routes which a few  years ago required endless days of surface travel, the  giant airliners of the Pan American Airways System  now speed from continent to continent in a few incredible hours. These huge 17-toiP flying ships of the  "Clipper" class, driven with m6re horsepower than a  locomotive, carry 44 passengers and a ton 6i express  and mail destined to 16 foreign countries south from  Miami twice each week. The crew of five includes a  steward who cares for the passengers' wants during  flight.  In two short hours they are landing at Havana and  the next day, after 13 hours of actual travel, they drop  down at Barranquilla, Colombia, entering port for  South America. Daily service is maintained the year  round to Havana and Nassau and additional planes are  added during the season to care for increased traffic.  Five new "Flying Clipper Ships," each of which accommodates 50 passengers, are being built for the southern  flying routes.  Cruising Down the Gulf Stream  All passenger boat lines coming into the port of  Miami and Miami Beach will augment, throughout the  winter, their regular year-round services with other  excursions, from Boston, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New  York and Galveston. -  A pleasant sea voyage on one of these crack coastwise liners is just the relaxation to prepare you for the  joyous adventure of your vacation here.

There is no harbor approach  in the ports of the world fairer than this.  These sea trips have become enormously popular,  and bookings for early excursions are well under way.  Your local travel agent can give you complete information concerning the low rates, sailing dates and  other details you'll want to know.  Regular and frequent sailing schedules to the port  of Miami are maintained by several major steamship  lines. The Clyde Mallory Lines connect with New  York and wayports to the north and Havana, Cuba, to  the south. The Munson Lines connect with New York,  Nassau and Havana, and the Merchants and Miners  Line connects with Boston, Baltimore and Philadelphia.  Excursion cruises of short and long duration to the  West Indies, the Bahamas, Cuba and the Caribbean  Isles are also provided from the Cities of the Sun.  No Detours for Motorists  Motor-bus lines, too, are in readiness for the early  rush, encouraging the migration with low-priced excursions from almost any point in the country.  Great, safe boulevards—Federal and State—lead to  and through the sunny peninsula of Florida, where motoring is as comfortable as in a city park and continuously stimulating with its exciting variations of natural beauties. Because of the excellent condition of  all these trunk line routes (you have a choice of at least  a half dozen), leading directly to the Cities of the Sun  from New York, Chicago and other points, without detours to irritate you, you can make the trip easily and  without fatigue in a few days. The varieties of landscape through which you pass will emphasize the exotic  beauties of this outdoor playland in your initial impressions. South of Miami, excellent roads weave  through orange, avocado and grapefruit groves in the  Redlands agricultural district, most beautiful and productive rural home setting in America.  above: A brisk canter before breakfast.

You  pay no more, on a seasonal basis, to enjoy these extra  months of delightful living. In fact, the early comers  benefit materially by taking advantage of lower pre-  winter rates which prevail in many quarters until January first. Besides, they have first choice of accommodations. Nearly all apartments in this playtime area  are furnished completely, from silverware and linens  to books and reading lamps. In numerous instances,  the rental includes lights, gas and maid service.  Healthful Sun Rays  When contemplating the advantages of your healthful sojourn here, you must know, both from the government reports and from those persons who have actually experienced it, that the climate of Miami and  Miami Beach is as salubrious and balmy in October or  May as it is in mid-winter. By reason of geography,  Miami and Miami Beach are the modern Cities of the  Sun, daily bathed in more direct and purer health-rays  than any spot in the country. Because of the miraculous evidences of this sun's vitalizing powers, intense  scientific research in heliotherapy is continually pursued here, and within the past several years a vast  and accurate knowledge of the sun and its benefits to  all life has been made available.  The Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., in a booklet  entitled "Sunlight, the Health Giver," notes this: "Following exposure to the sun, there is an increase in body  energy. Sun baths makef one feel and be stronger.  The mind becomes more active and seems able to do  more work. There is developed or increased the feeling of well being, of hopefulness and of the joy of living. .  .  .

Sunning  will kill also the germs of pneumonia and probably  those of many diseases which are not so well understood. ..."  Greater Ultra-Violet  The particular brand of ultra-violet which bathes  Miami Beach and Miami is of greater quantity and  intensity and has a more constant uniformity throughout the year than any other spot in the country.  The ultra-violet starts pumping across the horizon  when the sun has reached an altitude of about 30 degrees, it has been found. In Miami you can figure that  you're dabbling in the rays from about two hours after  sunrise until two hours before sunset. So, during the  winter months, this daily period of solar refreshment  stretches, roughly, from about 10 in the morning until  3 in the afternoon. Of course, in the longer summer  days, say in June, this expands to about 9 hours of valuable sun energy a day, from 8 a. m. to 5 p. m.  From Kindergarten to University  Children are welcome and especially favored in  Miami and Miami Beach. Let them grow sturdy in  this enchanting outdoor playground. You may enter  them in public or private schools at any time during  the term—the earlier the better for them, of course;  The two semesters of the school year embrace nine  months, commencing in September. Here the youngsters are thrilled with the healthful novelty of classes  out-of-doors and in cheerful, sunny schoolrooms, as  well as with the excitement of romping under coconut palms and on the clean beaches. Complete educational facilities are offered here, from the first kindergarten scribblings in colored crayons to the dignity  of an A.B. degree in the University of Miami.  The many private schools for both boys and girls  have developed because of the large winter resident  population. They include a military academy, art  academy and two fashionable girls' schools for the  older pupils, as well as a large number of schools  for elementary tutoring.  *-ri  above : Shuffleboard courts in Lummus Park, not  far from the courthouse.  below: A quartet of sail fish caught in the Gulf Stream.  l..x,m l.$^-,L** jML-J ,y ,M%, j-a*:  below: Riding a surf-board requires a nice sense of balance. 		image/tiff						79276605 Bytes	4809	5495	1554053097	RGB	8	600	asc99990000280010001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/489	489	490.jp2	/pamphlets/image/490.jp2

SURF    TIME  Mecca of Outdoor Sportdom  Famous around the world, the spectacular sports  program of Miami and Miami Beach is now in full  swing—the greatest wintertime variety of outdoor summer sports known.  There's a multitude of joyous activities, relished by  everybody whether he is teething or toothless. If you  prefer to loll on the sands and listen to the waves, there  are miles of silver beaches stretching north and south.  Perhaps you like a strenuous workout each morning  and afternoon. You'll have the opportunity here, for  there are 54 tennis courts, 11 golf courses, plenty of  riding academies, the whole Atlantic Ocean to fish in,  boats to sail, jungle to explore, wild game to shoot and  the more leisurely park sports such as shuffleboard,  bowling-on-the-green, horseshoe pitching, and dozens  of other outdoor diversions.  Dunking the Body in Surf  Immersing yourself plentifully in the sea water of  this tropic coast, breathing the invigorating sun-washed  sea air and allowing your body to soak in the healthful ultra-violet of this southern sun will rebuild your  vital forces amazingly. The salty tides that wash these  shores are particularly rich in iodine content—a health  factor of importance, as your doctor will tell you. Also,  the beneficial rays of the sun are more purely and directly absorbed in this latitude than anywhere else in  the United States. All the beaches within the confines  of Miami Beach and Miami are thoroughly patrolled  by well-equipped life-guard services. And sun-bathing  in a majority of places is supervised, to prevent overexposure and to provide the fullest benefits. Weekly  aquatic meets, in which some of the greatest swimming  and diving stars compete, are regular events of the  winter season.

Climate Comparisons  Famous resorts of the Riviera, Mediterranean and  Pacific Coast are all subject to sudden changes in  temperature. But here the variation between morning,  noon and night is slight. The average daily range  during the winter months is only 12.6 degrees.

GOLFING  When sand bunkers turn to snow-banks in the North,  the green sunny fairways of Miami and Miami Beach  become the itinerary of the country's golf parade. Before the first icicle forms on the eaves of the home-town  country club, America's golfers are on their way to the  Cities of the Sun. Here, in truth, is the winter golf  capital of the nation, where stars of the midiron and  niblick, as well as the fellows who haven't broken 90,  foregather to smack the pill down 'tween the palms  and loft it up, up 'gainst the sunny blue of clear winter  skies.  Eleven Sunny Links  In the Greater Miami area there are 11 golf courses,  exotic and beautiful with their landscaped tropic backgrounds, challenging with their sporty layouts. Green  fees range from as low as 50 cents upward.  With the Miami Biltmore $10,000 Open—America's  golfing classic—scheduled for December 8th, 9th and  10th this year, golfing interest of the nation becomes  centered on this area earlier than ever before. That is,  including the interest of those stay-at-homes envying  the wise fellows who came down here and have been  enjoying some of the sportiest golf in the world for  several months prior to the grand opening of the exhibition golf season. Golfdom's richest reward, the  Miami Biltmore Open (won last year by Denny Shute)  attracts the cream of the sports world, either as participants or spectators, because the most brilliant golf in  the world is played here by European and American  stars, amateur and professional.  A few winter months of golf in the Cities of the  Sun should improve your game enough to take all the  stay-at-homes into camp next summer, even if it does  mean lowering your handicap record at the club. That  is, IF all your fellow members stay away from Miami  and Miami Beach this winter.

Following the great $10,000 Open, the golf calendar  includes the $5,000 Florida Year Round Clubs Open,  Women's Invitation tournament, the Amateur Four Ball  tournament, the International Four Ball tournament,  held in March, and the Miami Open tournament, tentatively scheduled for January. Each club, of course,  schedules many tournaments for its members the year  round. The season's program includes at least ten  tournaments of nation-wide interest which are participated in by the greatest golf players in America.  On the five sporty courses of Miami Beach or the  six mighty tough layouts of the mainland, the duffer  or professional finds plenty of hazards to test his skill.  Women enjoy the breeze-swept and picturesque  courses of this region quite as much as the men. The  larger clubs usually engage nationally famous professionals as instructors during the winter season. In this  way, it is possible to obtain lessons from the best talent  available in the country while vacationing here.  Leaders of the Nation  Visitors and winter residents of the Cities of the Sun  include a roll call of the nation's notables. At one  time or another practically every figure of national importance revels in the relaxation of a vacation here.  President Franklin D. Roosevelt has tested the  prowess of the game fish among the Florida Keys, as  have former President Hoover and the late Warren G.  Harding. Among those who own homes here are such  men as Harvey Firestone, Col. E. H. R. Green, Byron  D. Miller, Carl G. Fisher, Webb Jay, Gar Wood, De-  Witt Page, Mark C. Honeywell, Albert Lasker, W. K.

FISHING  Snaggin' the Big Ones  Beneath the vast glitter of the,Gulf Stream lurks the  greatest challenge^ sport anglers in the world. In  these blue waters swim more than six hundred varieties of fish—a fish for every degree of angling skill and  many that defy Man and his puny hooks and lines—  ranging from the great game fish with lightning  speed and locomotive power, like the marlin, wahoo,  sailfish, tuna, bonito, dolphin and amber jack, to the  beautiful "pan" fish, such as the yellowtail, grunt, sea  trout, snapper, grouper and angel fish, flashing gorgeous colors through the shallower, crystalline waters  of Biscayne Bay.  300 Boats for Charter  Sport fishing in this area, because of its many excitements, is one of the most interesting attractions to  this great empire of outdoor play. Consequently, it  has been thoroughly developed in its technical details  to provide the maximum fun and comfort for its devotees. Both in Miami and Miami Beach, the sport  fisherman has available for charter at reasonable cost  crack fleets of boats—more than 300 of them!—completely equipped for any type of fishing and skippered  by experienced guides who know just where you can  snag the finny fighters. Gulf Stream trolling boats,  deep-sea fishing yachts, excursion boats and houseboats are continually carrying voyagers to the happy  fishing grounds along this glamorous coast.  Fresh-Water Fishing  For the sportsman who wants to keep his hand in on  his fresh-water skill there's a lot of fun to be caught  in the canals and rivers that weave glittering patterns  through the countryside westward of Miami. These  fresh waters of the Everglades are populous with black  bass, snook, perch and other varieties. Also within  easy access by motor are Florida's inland lakes and  waterways. Lake Okeechobee, less than a hundred  miles away, is the second largest fresh-water lake in  the United States. 		image/tiff						75963120 Bytes	4608	5495	3191777550	RGB	8	600	asc99990000280015001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/494	494	495.jp2	/pamphlets/image/495.jp2

Today, as yesteryear, these strangely beautiful  islands, washed by warm glittering tides, enfold the  visitor in a sort of drowsy peace. Fishing lodges, snug  and comfortable, nestle in the coconut groves along  the coasts, offering complete relaxation from the worry  and bustle of this busy world. Here are the world-  famous fishing grounds for sportsmen, shimmering  miles of angling thrills, extending from the keys to  the waters around Miami.  Lure of the Sea Isles  Much of the lure of the Keys is due to the fact that  it is not the exclusive hunting ground of the very  wealthy. The yachtsman, of course, formerly could  take advantage of the sport here because of the inaccessibility of the Keys. He could explore the little known  waters at his leisure and take all his modern comforts  with him. But now, since the Overseas Highway has  been built through to Key West, with only a few hours'  ferry gap between islands, the ordinary tourist or fisherman can drive anywhere and find fishing such as he  never hoped to dream of before.  The numerous stopover places for meals, bait, guides  and boats include, besides the lodges on Key Largo,  places called Rock Harbor, Tavernier, Islamorada,  Matecumbe and Ferry Landing, where the highway  meets the ferry.  Spiced Vacation Living  A week or two spent in the blissful tropic quietude  of the keys, where you may neglect the obvious formalities of dress and just loll around in a bathing suit,  old shirt and pants or, if you choose your location  discreetly, nothing at all, is a happy complement of  your more active days and nights in the gay resort life  of Miami Beach and Miami.  above: Won't that angel fish taste delicious?  below: Record marlin sword fish caught in  Gulf Stream—502 pounds.  the  H  A  A 		image/tiff						75963120 Bytes	4608	5495	1765186766	RGB	8	600	asc99990000280016001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/495	495	496.jp2	/pamphlets/image/496.jp2

Sailing Races  The first of the deep-sea sailing races is the Miami-  Nassau international event for all types of vessels on  February 27th, in which the cup of the Nassau Development Board and the Governor's cup are awarded.  The Sir Thomas Lipton Cup race is held March 14th;  the state championship race for small sailboats March  18th. The Miami-St. Petersburg sailing race, March  25th, is under the auspices of the Biscayne Bay Yacht  Club. Sailboat races in upper Biscayne Bay are held  twice weekly, the year round.  International Regatta  The Miami Beach Regatta for motor-boats, held in  March, is one of the important championship sporting  events of the year, introducing many of the newest and  fastest racing motor-boats in the world. This is the  oldest regatta held annually in this country.  Under the auspices of the Miami Beach Yacht Club,  and the American Power Boat Association, the largest  delegation of European and American motor-boat  drivers ever to gather for a world's championship  series, will compete in the regatta in Biscayne Bay  next March, 1934. Sportsman drivers from France,  Italy, Spain and Great Britain were the first of the 22  foreign countries represented in the International Motor Yachting Union to notify local officials that they  would compete. The foremost American drivers will  also bring their boats here to contest for world championship honors.  Among the foreign entries reported assured for next  spring are three 12-liter Italian racing boats, three  Spanish outboard drivers as well as a strong British  outboard team. The concluding four final races of the  Florida series will be run on the Biscayne Bay course 		image/tiff						78287505 Bytes	4749	5495	255243727	RGB	8	600	asc99990000280017001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/496	496	497.jp2	/pamphlets/image/497.jp2

Winners in these races will  receive cups and will compete in a Grand Final Race  for the outboard championship of the world. The  races will be "boat for boat," with no point system used.  For the Tennis Enthusiast  Another gay phase of this brilliant outdoor life is  tennis, which numbers more devotees here than in any  other area of similar population. In Miami Beach and  Miami are more than a half hundred public courts, supervised by the recreation departments of both cities—  many of them clay courts; others are made of concrete,  asphalt and special patented surfacing. Most of the  larger hotels and clubs maintain their own courts and  many residences include tennis courts in their landscape plans.  Each winter celebrated net stars come to this outdoor  playground for the many brilliant matches that are  held regularly and for the opportunity to keep in form  for the summer tourneys at Wimbledon, Forest Hills,  Long Island and other tennis capitals.  International Match  This year, plans are being consummated for an  annual international match that will bring champions  from all Latin America, as well as from countries of  the Eastern Hemisphere.  Such high ranking tennis players as George Lott and  Willmer Allison, members of the Davis Cup team,  Cliff Sutter, Gregory Mangin and Berkley Bell, who  competed in the All South Tennis tournament here  last year, are winter visitors. "Big Bill" Tilden, greatest name of them all, and Vincent Richards, former  Davis Cup contender, come here to enjoy the surf, the  sun, and the incomparable clay courts.  At the city parks along the ocean front, bathing suits  or shorts are the accepted tennis costumes. A fast set  of singles followed by a dip in the surf is guaranteed  to keep you fit and trim during the season. Several of  the large estates in Coconut Grove, southern Miami  suburb, have private tennis courts and numerous  private schools offer tennis as part of their facilities.  above : Tennis is played in picturesque settings.  below: "Big Bill" Tilden reaches for a high one.

RIDING  Palm-Fringed Bridle Paths  Numerous bridle trails threading through palm  groves and pine hammocks invite the horseman to indulge his favorite sport in Miami Beach, Miami and  the suburban environs of these Cities of the Sun. In  addition to the many private stables of riding horses,  there are several riding academies that provide mounts  of every gait and disposition, from a gentle pony for  a child to a spirited jumper for the expert. Experienced masters are available at all these academies.  Horseback treasure hunts, moonlight rides and riding  breakfasts are frequent gay variations for the horseback rider here.  Society Horse Show  The annual Society Horse Show, inaugurated last  season by the Miami Biltmore Hotel, brings to Miami  the thoroughbreds of the most fashionable stables in  America, to compete in all saddle and driving classes.  It is a social function, too, of national interest and  marks a brilliant crescendo of the winter season in  the Cities of the Sun.  Polo at the Beach  One of the exciting spectator sports that has built  up a wide public interest in this section is polo. In  Miami Beach there are held three polo matches a week,  on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday afternoons, beginning in December and continuing until the latter part  of March. Internationally celebrated polo stars bring  their strings of ponies to Miami Beach every winter.  Here in a setting of tropic loveliness you witness  some of the most brilliant horsemanship and adroit  playing in the world. An average of 30 players, representing the important polo clubs of America, gather  every season for play. In addition to the stars there  are active and retired capitalists, nationally known  writers, publishers, youngsters from eastern colleges—  horse lovers all—who make up the crowds at the  tri-weekly matches. John Hertz, Fred Post, Hal Talbot,  Robert Hassler are some of the better known names  familiar in Beach polo groups. 		image/tiff						79565145 Bytes	4809	5515	2003151767	RGB	8	600	asc99990000280021001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/500	500	501.jp2	/pamphlets/image/501.jp2

The Sport of Kings  Against the splendor of tropic palms, formal gardens, vast lawns and landscaped driveways leading to  the grandstands and clubhouses, the sport of kings  takes on additional beauty and exhilaration in Miami.  Many of the best-known racing stables in this country,  as well as the most illustrious riding stars, are represented each winter during the Miami race meets at  Hialeah Park and Tropical Park.  For example, in the vast stables of the Miami Jockey  Club in Hialeah Park—the world's most beautiful  race track—are housed during each winter's meeting  the thoroughbreds of such notable sportsmen and  sportswomen as Col. E. R. Bradley, Joseph E. Widener,  George D. Widener, Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney,  Mrs. John Hay Whitney, Mrs. H. C. Phipps, Willis  Sharp Kilmer, Warren Wright, Mrs. M. L. Eastman,  J. 0. Keene, Hal Price Headley, C. LeRoy King, W.  Preston Burch and Allan Ryan.  Pari-mutuel systems of wagering have been legalized here, as you doubtless know. With coordinated  meeting dates, the two tracks provide a continuous racing season for 90 days.  Extended Racing Season  The following dates have been assigned by the Florida State Racing Commission for this season's meet:  The Coral Gables Racing Association at Tropical Park,  Coral Gables, will open December 28th and continue  through January 24th, then reopen on March 18th and  close March 31st. The Miami Jockey Club at Hialeah  Park has a straight 45-day season beginning January  25th and ending March 17th.  The race meets here are the Mecca of track sportsmen from all over the country.  above: Racing season starts December 28th at  Tropical Park.  below: Between paddock and grandstand at Hialeah Park.  below: Parade before start of race at Hialeah Park,  home of the Miami Jockey Club.  ■**«*  mm "'AAS?:  I 		image/tiff						79565145 Bytes	4809	5515	111515344	RGB	8	600	asc99990000280022001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/501	501	502.jp2	/pamphlets/image/502.jp2

Visitors  of all ages enjoy the various park sports.  below : Cycling has special attractions in the warm sunshine.  Going to the Dogs  Greyhound racing, too, has been proficiently developed here. It is a night-time amusement, with the  lean-muscled canine thoroughbreds romping after the  tantalizing mechanical rabbit under the artificial sunshine of floodlights. Three picturesque tracks in the  Greater Miami area, all operating the pari-mutuel  system, afford an abundance of nocturnal excitement  for great crowds of spectators, from the opening on  December 25th until the close, April 1st.  If you've never watched a greyhound race, you've  got a thrill coming to you here. First, there is  the ceremony of the parade of dogs, each with his  uniformed attendant, past the judges, to the post where  each is housed in a separate stall; then comes a hush  of the murmuring spectators as the white rabbit appears on its rail and starts wheeling rapidly around  the track, and finally the snap of the gates and lightning leap of the dogs, as they pursue their prey.  In the City Parks  If your sporting tastes tend towards less robust activities than hunting, fishing, swimming, sailing, tennis  and golf, you will undoubtedly find zestful amusement  in games provided by the recreation departments of the  Cities of the Sun—on the shuffleboard or horseshoe  pitching courts, the bowling-on-the-green rinks, at the  chess or checker tables (outdoors in the shade of colored canopies). More active park sports include volley  ball, handball, archery, fencing and diamond ball.  New fork Giants  The baseball enthusiast will be interested to know  that the New York Giants will come to Miami Beach  for their spring training. They will play many exhibition games with other Big Leaguers and semi-pro  teams. During the winter, college football also claims  the attention of thousands of fans here. And weekly  bills of boxing are heightened during the season by  national championship bouts. 		image/tiff						79565145 Bytes	4809	5515	3959661482	RGB	8	600	asc99990000280023001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/502	502	503.jp2	/pamphlets/image/503.jp2

The roads are level and smooth as a billiard table, so  every drop of gas used while the family bus is in gear  gets you nearer your destination. Motoring through  the two Cities of the Sun is in itself a varied and  stimulating interest, whether past the palatial estates  and charming residences of Miami Beach and Miami's  suburban area, along the ocean boulevard or over the  bay by one of the three causeways. Beyond the urban  limits lie many routes of motoring adventure—westward to the Everglades, southward to the Redlands,  the Florida keys and the overseas motor highway towards Key West, or northward along the sea.  Exploring the Everglades  South and west of Miami, in the Cape Sable country,  on the outermost rim of the Florida peninsula, lies a  romantic wilderness of water and jungle that challenges the adventurous spirit of the explorer. Some  of it has never been trodden by man. Wild life, both  animal and vegetable, flourishes in tropical grandeur.  Wrapped in silence, it is America's last frontier, and  only continental tropics.  Because of the wealth of bird life arid rare tropical  growths, the Federal government has officially recommended this area as a national park—the only national  tropical park in the country. It is now accessible by  boats, or it may be seen from the air; There are still  vast areas that remain to be explored.  Also in this southerly direction, nearer Miami, are  Royal Palm State Park, maintained by Florida Federation of Women's Clubs, and Matheson Hammock, another natural park maintained by Dade County. Both  parks contain magnificent specimens of tropic palms  and other trees and shrubs, both indigenous and imported from countries in this tropic zone around the  world.  Copyright by G. W.

REVELRY  Tropic stars, twinkling almost within reach of your  finger-tips; enormous orange moons ballooning up  from under the horizon of the sea; lacy palm fronds,  entangling the soft glow of colored lights; gentle sea  breezes, fragrant with blossoms—these are some of the  natural attributes of the warm winter nights in the  Cities of the Sun that make nocturnal gaiety more  gracious and glamorous than in the usual haunts of  pleasure-seekers.  Revelry Beneath the Stars  Most of the dance rendezvous—in hotel estates,  country clubs, beer gardens and night clubs—have  adapted their entertainment presentations to the outdoor beauty, with terrazzo dance floors set within  groves of palm trees or with sliding roofs that can be  rolled back to expose the glittering night sky. Down  here you can avoid the stuffiness and cigarette-laden  air of the usual night-club room and wholeheartedly  enjoy the comfort—and romance—of dancing under  the stars, while an orchestra tempts your pulse with  the rhythms of America, Cuba and the Argentine.  Favorite Broadway entertainers—stars of musical  comedy, opera, concert, cabaret and pictures—come  every winter to the Cities of the Sun, many to fill  engagements in hotels, casinos and clubs, others solely  to enjoy the colorful vacation life here. In the luxurious night clubs, hotels and casinos, on both sides  of Biscayne Bay, night life attains a splendor and zest  that is unsurpassed even by the gay resorts of Europe.  In fact, here is a cosmopolitan playground that caters  to the spirit of carnival and the Continental viewpoint  of personal freedom.  Band Concerts Out-of-Doors  For those who may not care for the gayer pleasures  of whoopee and wassail, there are nightly free band  concerts in the big public park amphitheatres in Miami's beautiful Bayfront Park and at Miami Beach.  These concerts are augmented once a week by pageants,  variety shows and other sprightly entertainments, all  offered free to the public. 		image/tiff						79565145 Bytes	4809	5515	3950777690	RGB	8	600	asc99990000280025001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/504	504	505.jp2	/pamphlets/image/505.jp2

There  are eight land plane and four seaplane bases. Repair  and rebuilding facilities are available for all types of  planes. The large land plane base of Pan American  Airways includes factory equipment for the complete  rebuilding of airplanes and motors. Storage and repairs are available for visiting airmen at three of the  airports. Charter service and flying schools are also  included.  The United States Navy has a training field and  mooring mast for Navy dirigibles of the "Macon" type  just north of the Municipal Airport. The Army Air  Corps maintains a training base at Chapman Field,  south of Miami, and the Coast Guard air station is  located on Biscayne Bay near the large international  seaplane base of Pan American Airways.  All-American Air Races  The Annual Miami All-American Air Races have  established their hold upon the hearts of aviation men  from all over the world by winning the national record  for two years in the number of airplanes and pilots  taking active part. They will occur this season Thursday, Friday and Saturday, January 11th, 12th, and  13th. Air Race Week will feature the dedication of  Pan American Airways' million-dollar seaplane base,  the most efficient and finest seaplane base ever built.  The Doherty Trophy Race and New York to Florida  Air Cruise, ending at Miami, will be the season's greatest sporting event for amateur and sportsman pilots.

Plan to Stay Through May  With all these good things waiting for you and  yours—robust health and happy living—to enjoy at  a modest cost that gratifies your purse and keeps you  within your budget, you should plan to take advantage  of them just as soon as you can get your affairs in  order. Fling yourself wholeheartedly into the adventure, without cluttering your enjoyment with secret  inhibitions about business and the other mechanics of  living. Before you come down, determine in your own  mind to linger as long as possible—because you're  wasting neither time nor money by spending a winter  in the Cities of the Sun. A vacation here is an investment in good health and good spirits, without which  you can't hope to enjoy good business. There are no  "winter garments of repentance" here.  If it be impossible for you to get in early on the  fun, at least arrange for your family to do so. They'll  be only a few hours away from you, remember.  Pack your favorite putter, bathing suit and old fishing hat right now and call for the time-tables. It's  the playtime season for 1933-34 in these unique Cities  of the Sun—Miami and Miami Beach.

Glance at a globe or world map  and follow the Miami line of latitude  across to Africa. You'll note that  Miami is 300 miles further south  than Cairo. Also, it is some 600 miles  further south than Los Angeles.  Set against the sea on the edge of  the tropics, Miami basks in the sun.  Steady trade winds blow inland;  balmy air is free of dust, smoke, smog  and pollen. Life is leisurely in a setting that is warm and wonderful.  Miami started out with a king-size  combination of sunshine, tropical  jungle, long beaches of white sand.  It was actually like many a spot in  the South Seas. Except that neither  in the South Seas nor any other spot  in the world have so many millions  on millions been spent to create an  area in which every comfort, every  convenience, every form of luxury  and sport and entertainment is combined with such a magnificent climate and scenic setting.  It was a small fishing village at  the turn of the century—remote,  isolated and without transportation.  Now, it is only hours away by air  from any spot in the United States-  a nearby tropical haven from snow  and ice.  The area for miles around the site  of the former village is known as  "Greater Miami." Actually, Miami 		image/tiff						44041215 Bytes	3025	4853	2165169254	RGB	8	600	asc99990000100005001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/521	521	522.jp2	/pamphlets/image/522.jp2

If this is to be your first flight you  should know that fares are the same  for similar services on all scheduled  airlines, and that there are three different fare plans:  1. Straight Daytime Fare —Same on all  flights, non-stop or limited express. No  extra fare, even on Delta-C&S's finest,  fastest and most comfortable deluxe  planes. (Note: always buy round trip  and save 10% on return portion.)  2. Family Plan Fare — On Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday, mother and children  aged 2 to 22 may travel at half-fare in  company with father at full fare. One  child under 2 rides free. Family group  need not return with full-fare member  but must travel on Family Plan days.  3. OWL Aircoach Economy Fare — Operated only at night, when planes are  ordinarily idle, and hence at about 32 %  lower fare. The same airplanes, both  non-stop and local, as used in daytime  flights but minus meals and frills.  All fares are subject to a U. S.  travel tax of 15%  A scheduled airline such as Delta-  C&S, operates all three types of service in accordance with strict government standards which no irregular or non-scheduled airline can possibly approach.  Obtaining Reservations  Having determined the date for  your trip and understanding the  three fare plans, you are ready to  phone a Delta-C&S Air Lines office,  or your travel agent, for flight schedules and fare details. Reservations  can be confirmed very quickly but  to be sure of desired dates you  should act early. 		image/tiff						42294135 Bytes	2905	4853	1411767883	RGB	8	600	asc99990000100006001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/522	522	523.jp2	/pamphlets/image/523.jp2

Your travel agent can also obtain  hotel accommodations, and even a  rental car if you wish. He has literature and rates on most hotels and  apartments. There is no charge for  this service or for obtaining your airline ticket, for the travel agent is  compensated on a commission basis  by such companies for serving you.  A list of all Miami and Miami  Beach hotels will be found on page  53 of this booklet, in case you wish  to write them direct for rates and  literature, or you may find suggestions in the travel sections of your  Sunday paper.  In case you wish an apartment  for a longer stay, address a letter to  the "Visitor's Bureau" of the Chamber of Commerce of either Miami or  Miami Beach (see page 47) who  will send you a list of availabilities.  Make plans early-and go when  you want to go.  Comments on Clothes  Sports clothes are the almost universal attire of Miami. You'll see  Bikinis on the beach and in terrace  bars, housewives shopping in supermarkets in scanty shorts, men wearing sports jackets in night clubs and  brokerage offices. There's nothing  stuffy about Miami. What you wear  is determined only by your figure  and age.  Take sports clothes, then, first of  all. Swim suits, casual beach clothes,  slacks, shorts, also sun glasses, should  be on your list. Take your normal  summer sports wear for golf, tennis,  riding. Most of the fishing fans wear  shorts but you can get quite a sunburn if that's all you take along for  the day.  The races provide a backdrop for  a daily fashion parade with eyefulls  Ocean-fVonf hotels line Miami Beach mile on  mile . . . reservations are easy to obtain. 		image/tiff						43750035 Bytes	3005	4853	2569407760	RGB	8	600	asc99990000100007001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/523	523	524.jp2	/pamphlets/image/524.jp2

Jackets are  de rigeur for men, even if the checks  and colors are loud enough to make  the horses break the barrier.  After sundown, when you go out  to dine and dance, you have quite  a choice. Women wear casual street  clothes or evening gowns, in about  an even proportion. A quick survey  of men's attire shows a three-way  split generally, between regular  suits, dark dinner jackets or summer  dinner jackets of light hues. Whatever your choice, you'll be in good  company.  You won't need galoshes or mittens in Miami but occasionally a  super-blizzard in the north sends  cooler breezes rustling through the  palms. On those occasions you'll  need a sweater for sports, a light  coat for evening wear. It doesn't  happen often, but even the most  ardent booster for Miami weather  will admit that a sweater or jacket  feels good on occasion. The average  winter temperature is 70 ° with only  a slight difference between morning  and evening, and the average temperature in summer is 80°.  ACTIVITIES-  Participating Sports  Boating  Miami, like Venice, is built  around waterways at the edge of  the sea. Biscayne Bay alone has  370 square miles of sheltered water.  Outside, there are the channels and  blue water yachting lanes between  mainland and keys, Florida Reefs  and Bahamas.  You can have your choice of  marine methods.

Charter boats furnish everything including block-and-tackle to hoist your catch aboard.  Fishing  Florida fishing ranges from fabulous to fantastic. It covers all the  ranges: from greatest of game fish  to perch; from the utmost in luxury  craft and tackle to rowboats and  plain cane poles. It includes deep  sea fishing and angling inland on  fresh water lakes. You can pay for  luxury, or have just as much fun  without spending a dime. You can  fish in utter isolation or with congenial crowds.  Basically, there are five broad  types of fishing around Miami. Here  are the five, take your choice:  Deep Sea Fishing  The Gulf Stream flows through  the Straits of Florida between Key  West and Cuba and swings north  past Miami into the Atlantic. Mov  ing at four miles an hour, this great  slow river in the sea carries a teeming marine life that reaches a peak  of prolific intensity along the banks  and keys and reefs of Florida. It  makes the fishing out of Miami the  best in the world.  This is the fishing of Hemingway  and Philip Wylie. This is the fishing  for marlin, sailfish, dolphin, alba-  core, barracuda, cobia, wahoo and  all the great fish that fight and leap  and run and come to the gaff only  after a grueling grind.  Once, it was millionaire's sport.  Now, for a nominal sum, you can  enjoy it for a day, a half-day or a  week.  Stroll down to the docks in the  late afternoon and watch the fleet  come in.

This is reef fishing several miles offshore. You use a light  rod and reel, or hand line. Anglers  aboard may number several dozen  but the fishing is superb.

Fresh Water Fishing  Back of Miami is Lake Okeechobee, one of the nation's largest  lakes. It's fresh water but has salt  water status in catch limits, because it's so crowded with fish the  authorities don't consider regulation  enforcement worth the effort. Other  lakes around Miami, though not as  big, offer the same wealth of fresh  water fish. Rivers and the hundreds  of miles of canals have the same  fresh water types.  Use light tackle. Bass are biggest  fish you'll catch inland, but some  of these may run to ten pounds and  more. You'll need a license. Nonresident, 14-day type costs $3.25.  Skiffs can be rented at nearly all  lakes and along rivers.  Florida fresh water fish are not  as numerous as salt water types.  Main catch is made up of bass, both  12  smallmouth and largemouth, bream  — also known as bluegill or sunfish—  pike, speckled perch which are  likewise called crappie or calico  bass. Also warmouth, shellcracker  and stumpknocker.  Shore Fishing  Around Miami, you can fish from  piers, causeways, docks, bridges,  jetties and the beach. You're welcome to fish in most spots; signs  indicate the restricted areas. Waters  are clean and clear, a sharp contrast to many major cities.  Hundreds of species are caught  in this type of fishing, or from skiffs  and outboards in the bay. It's salt  water fishing, so you don't need a  license.  It's inexpensive fishing too. Use  a rod and reel, a cane pole or a  handline. Bait might cost a few  cents. But that's all.  These inland waters are famous  for bonefish. Many sportsmen swear  that pound for pound, this is greatest fighting fish of all. Caught on  shallow flats; lightning fast; requires  light tackle. Prize weight twelve  pounds, average about four. So  much sport that some big game  fishermen have switched to bonefish  angling entirely.  Big thrill from small catch adds to family  fun of shore fishing along Miami waterways 		image/tiff						42699795 Bytes	2945	4833	1690428971	RGB	8	600	asc99990000100012001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/528	528	529.jp2	/pamphlets/image/529.jp2

Spear Fishing  Here's a new marine sport packed  with action.  You leave your own air element  and go underwater to stalk fish with  a spear. You wear goggles for clear  vision, foot fins for swimming speed.  Spears may be air-powered or rubber elastic driven.  Even with no hits, swimming  along coral reefs and through marine  gardens in crystal clear water gives  you a thrill no other fishing can.  Sport shops carry spear fishing  equipment or you can rent rigs.  Some begoggled fishermen merely  wade out from shore, others work  from small boats. Shallow water  fishing grounds, with myriad fish,  are everywhere around Miami.  Still newer as a submarine sport is  Aqua-Lung diving ... for good  swimmers in good shape. Depths of  100 feet are feasible for a half-hour  or more. Two necessary hours of instruction cost $6; full equipment for  diving is about $10 a day. Underwater cameras may also be rented.

The competition runs about three  months. All visitors are welcome to  compete and thousands do. There  are trophies for the season's best  catch of each type of game fish.  There are special sections for plug  and fly casting and spinning. And  even a trophy for the most incredible  tough luck  fisherman  of the  Official weighing and measuring  stations are on all the main charter  docks. Also in the Everglades, Florida Keys and Bahamas, so you can  compete in the tourney while on  side-trips. Entering your catch in  the tournament is a matter of minutes. Winners are announced at the  end of the season.  In addition to trophies for season  winners, there are also official citations for meritorious catches. These  much-coveted citations are for fish  right up among the leaders, possibly  only ounces short of tops. They are  positive proof, to skeptical friends,  of the big one that didn't get away.  Also, sportsmen who like to release their fish after a successful  battle now get a "Release Certificate" as proof of both their angling  skill and sportsmanship.  Here's a Challenge  Listed here are the all-tackle or  general division records set since the  Miami tournament was established  in 1936. But since there are always  bigger fish in the sea, you may set  a record that will stand for years.  Or, if you are a light tackle fan, you  may win fame for a new record  with plug, fly or spinning reel.

Page 15																																	asc9999000010	asc99990000100015001		Golf  Three things will impress you  about Miami golf. First, the incredible beauty of fairways, greens and  even roughs . . . especially in midwinter when your own course may  be buried in snow. Second, the  depth of turf on fairways; it's wonderful for wood shots. Third, the  fair and challenging but at times  fiendish layout of these courses —  mostly built on artificial land and  thus designed from scratch for good  golfing layouts. If you slice or hook,  bring a sand wedge.  One point most Florida visitors  appreciate: courses are tricky and  tough, but walking is sweet and  easy. No rock quarries to scramble  out of, no cliffs to climb, no long  flights of stairs up to tees.  Watch the pros. If you've wanted  to study the swings and style of  play of the top-money pros, here's  your chance. They'll be in Miami  for the winter tournaments. See  sports pages for tee-off times of  your favorites.  Eleven courses: 7 public, 4 private. Greens fees at public courses  are comparable to those in other  sections of the country.

Page 17																																	asc9999000010	asc99990000100017001		Hunting  You want to get down to Florida  early, ahead of the winter season  peak, for the best hunting. Deer season is mainly in December and  waterfowl shooting is open during  most of same month.  Big hunting in January is for wild  turkey. Gobblers only, though. Or  you can try to hit fast-flying quail  to February 1. Camps with good  guides dot the hunting country; the  Visitor's Bureau in Miami will send  addresses. Turkeys, quail and ducks  are principal game, but you may  bump into a bear, wildcat or occasional panther.  Non-resident hunting license is  $26.50, but you can get 10-day  license for $11.50, including wildcats and panthers.  Photography  By all means, take a camera. Borrow one, if you have none of your  own. You should have a record of  your vacation. And in Miami, you'll  find subjects that are a must for  your record, whether you are a  camera expert or amateur.  Color film is the ideal, if you have  a camera which can use it. The color  in Miami will astonish you, from  seascapes and skyline panoramas to  flaming shrubs and parrots.  Take an exposure meter, too, if  you have one, for Miami light is  tricky. It is brilliant and intense.  Thus, normal exposures in northern  latitudes will be over-exposures in  Miami. The intensity of light, however, means that you can get better  depth of field with smaller iris openings, or better action shots with  faster shutter speeds for normal  openings.  If you use black and white film,  add a filter for marine shots and sky  scenes. A K-type is adequate, but  you may wish to experiment with  "A" or "G" filters if you have them.  Photographers will also find Miami  a wonderful subject for infra-red  photography.  If you take pictures from your  plane seat on the way down, you  must also watch out for over-exposure. You can get sharp pictures  through the windows, but don't rest  your arms against the actual window while shooting. You may get  unwanted vibration.  For best results with motion picture cameras, take along a tripod if  you can. It's valuable for pan shots  of racing, water ballets, leaping fish.  There are many stores in Miami  where you can get film, but take  your own supply if that is convenient; for a local store may run short  of some sizes during the height of  the season.  Shuffleboard is a fine way to get a tan with  little energy but a lot of leisurely fun.  Shuffleboard  This dry land version of the shipboard game is popular in Florida.  17 		image/tiff						42989775 Bytes	2965	4833	585929714	RGB	8	600	asc99990000100017001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/533	533	534.jp2	/pamphlets/image/534.jp2

There's racing  daily, from around Thanksgiving on  through the winter to late April.  For Miami has not one, but three  tracks and if you thrill to the sight  of running horses, you can follow  your hobby at the track any week  day during the long winter season.  Also, if you like to back your  judgment or sheer guesses on winners, there are the pari-mutuel windows that range from $2 to $100.  There's no limit on the number of  tickets you can buy.  Hialeah, for example, attracts  over a million visitors a year during  the months when the race meet is  over. Admission is free except on  racing days.  It cost more than $1,500,000 to  build Hialeah Park. There are over  a thousand big palms, some 10,000  pines, 20,000 shrubs and 70,000  small plants. The Clubhouse Drive  is lined with 24 royal palms, the  tallest and most perfect specimens  which could be found in all of the  Everglades. And all the palms are  perfectly matched for size and  symmetry.  There is an infield lake of 32  acres; on an island in the lake lives  the rare colony of flamingos—rare  because it is the only colony of its  kind and wild flamingo flocks have  decreased at an alarming rate in  recent years. Once a year on Flamingo Day, the priceless birds are  paraded around the infield turf  course. The clubhouse, the paddock, the fountains —all are worth  seeing.  Big races of the year at Hialeah  are the Widener and Flamingo  Stakes. The other two tracks likewise are beauty spots, likewise have  big races in addition to the daily  cards.

It's a  game you just watch, and perhaps  bet on, but you don't play it. For it  is a centuries-old Spanish game  combining the fastest, toughest and  roughest parts of tennis, handball  and lacrosse.  It's so fast, a champion player is  old at 21, washed up at 25. Only  Latins, mostly Basques, seem to be  able to play it.  The players shown are each wearing a "cesta," a reed basket that is  a combination of racquet, glove  and bat. With it, he catches and  hurls the small leather, ball, as the  game whirls up and down the long,  long court and walls.  Nine games are played every  night, except Sunday. You can bet  on every game, if you wish; pari-  mutuel wagering is under state  supervision. But you'd better watch  one game first, to find out just what  you're backing. Incidentally, Jai-  Alai is pronounced Hi-Li.  There's just no one game you  can compare it to, but it's got the  speed and excitement of ice hockey,  modern basketball, pro tennis and  big league double plays. Plus pari-  mutuels.

Every week night the greyhounds  race. There are four tracks in the  Miami area and the dog racing starts  late in the fall and continues  until spring.  Colorful crowds in the stands,  pari-mutuel windows, the problem  of picking winners, the tension before the start, the cheering on to  the finish—all the atmosphere is  somewhat akin to that of the horse  tracks. Dog racing procedure is  frankly based on horse customs, but  the sport has a host of fans of its  own, plus an equally big section of  visitors who watch the horses run  in the afternoon and dogs at night.

K-4  Wafer Shows  Just as the classic lines of the  ballet were molded in Europe, so  the water ballet has developed into  a classic art in Miami. Troupes of  mermaid-ballerinas are all part of  the traditional Miami water show,  which in turn is part of the aquatic  life centering around the elaborate  swimming pools of the big hotels.  In fact, there's some mild confusion as to whether the shows produced the pools or the pools the  shows. Either way, it's a beautiful  and stirring sight on the Miami scene  and at least one water show is a  must on your calendar. Some are  staged Sunday afternoons, others at  night.  Sun-tanned beauties make up the  water troupes of slow-motion ballet.  Diving teams of Olympic champions flash down from the heights.  Superbly muscled bodies whirl  down in series of precision-timed  somersaults, or seemingly float down  in graceful arcs.

Built on "made" land between  Biscayne Bay and Biscayne Boulevard, in the heart of the city. Landscaped with 10,000 tropical trees,  flowers and shrubs, crossed by  lovely walks. An open-air theatre  seats 6,500; new City Auditorium  is at other end of park. Ideal for  sunning, lazy walks, watching the  pageant of traffic on Biscayne Bay.  Crandon Park  An island —Biscayne Key—has  been made into a public park, with  one of the world's most beautiful  beaches. It's two and a half miles  long, palm trees at surf's edge give  shade from too much sun. Picnic  tables, cabanas, neat food stands,  children's amusements. Plus a top-  notch zoo of the big carnivora, birds  and reptiles and assorted monkeys  for amusement of all ages.  A famed feature of the amusement section is the Biscayne Bay,  Atlantic & Gulf Railroad, a miniature scenic railroad which winds  through a mile and a half of jungle  — adults and children sitting in and  atop the diminutive cars, the whistle  of the knee-high locomotive blowing in fine style for crossings.

As a botanist and explorer  for the Department of Agriculture,  he started before the turn of the  century to bring in new plants and  trees useful to America for food or  industry, plus new shrubs and  plants and trees as ornaments.  In 1938 Colonel and Mrs. Robert H. Montgomery of Coral Gables  established the gardens in honor of  their neighbor, Dr. Fairchild. Today, it covers 83 acres, contains  some 300 species of palms and  more than 700 species of other  tropical trees and shrubs. Many  were introduced to the U. S. by Dr.  Fairchild. You'll see specimens of  the acacia tree from the African  veldt, umbrella tree from Australia,  baobab tree of Africa, lingaro vines  from the Philippines, plus mahogany, agave, cassavo, cannon-ball  and sandbox trees.  Whether you just putter in your  garden occasionally or win prizes  in club work, you'll enjoy a few  hours of leisurely looking in these  gardens.

He tried all the sun countries,  then picked Miami as the site for his  Vizcaya: a 16th century Italian pal-  azzo set in 30 acres of formal Italian gardens along Biscayne Bay ...  a home for himself, a palace for his  art.  There's nothing like it in America.  A thousand artisans worked five  years on buildings and gardens. Entire Cuban villages were bought to  get weathered hand-made roof tiles.  Quarries were bought outright for  coral stone. In vast warehouses,  rooms were test built and furnished.  From Europe and Egypt and the  Orient, from the castles and palaces  of the nobles who made history in  Renaissance centuries, came the  works of art and furnishings. No one  knows the cost, for Deering never  said.  Now this great fortress-palace and  its gardens are open to you as the  Dade County Art Museum, a gift of  the Deering heirs. Twenty of its  great rooms may be visited, the salons and banquet halls and tea and  music rooms with the art of princes  and kings. All the gardens are open,  acre on acre of lawns, marble pools,  statuary, arbors, grottos and bridges,  climaxed at the edge of the sea by a  stone barge breakwater with sculpture depicting pleasures and perils  of the sea.  Allow two hours, at least, to see  Vizcaya. A full day is better. Bring  your camera (flash prohibited indoors).  On South Miami Ave. at 32nd Rd. Open  daily except Mondays.

"Air  Boats"  are   used  to   patrol  the   lonely   wastes  of  the   Everglades,  may also be rented at points along the Tamiami Trail for sightseeing trips.  Everglades National Park  Newest of the national parks,  over a million acres of utter wilderness with a strange beauty unlike anything else in the nation's  geography.  The Seminole word for Everglades means "grass water." It's an  accurate word, for the saw grass  stretches like a sea to the horizon,  broken occasionally by little elevations known as "hammocks," covered with palms, mangroves, pines  and tamarinds. On these hammocks  studded through the grass sea, the  Seminoles camped and planted  meager crops.  It's a lonely land newly risen from  the sea, a half-and-half mixture of  water and earth reminiscent of the  world eons ago.  34  Here, the great wading birds live  in colonies—snowy egret, white ibis,  roseate spoonbill, American egret,  white heron. Plus wild fowl of the  north, at migration time.  Here is the home of the alligator,  also the now-rare American crocodile so seldom seen. Florida otters  resemble little seals; raccoons are  common and feed along the trails  at the edge of the glades. About  dusk, you can hear and sometimes  see bobcats and cougars.  There is only one road through  the Everglades National Park, it is  open only in fair weather. The  Everglades are not to be explored  alone.  For a brief visit, and a fair sample of the Everglades, go by bus  out to the Royal Palm Ranger  station and take one of the short 		image/tiff						42409815 Bytes	2925	4833	3510539444	RGB	8	600	asc99990000100034001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/550	550	551.jp2	/pamphlets/image/551.jp2

For a longer trip, take the  one-day or two-day trip of the National Audubon Society. Ask the  Miami office of the society for dates  and rates.  Audubon Society: McAllister Arcade    . G-14  Redlands  South of Miami are thousands of  acres of winter crops. This is the  Redlands area, famed for tomatoes,  beans, avocados, mangos, papaya  groves, lemons, limes and grapefruit. Winter is an ideal time for a  visit; one crop or another is always  at the harvest stage, packing plants  in full action.  Fort Lauderdale  Just up the beach from Miami  is Fort Lauderdale, whose citizens  would feel at home in Venice. One-  tenth of the city area is water; there  are 215 miles of streets  but 263  miles of waterways; New River is  practically the main thoroughfare;  and blocks of the eastern section are  marked off by canals, not streets.  It is, in all, a tropical wonderland  on water. It is a vacation spot for  play, yet is carefully kept free of  any carnival atmosphere.  In a landlocked basin at the foot  of the city is Bahia-Mar, the nation's  largest, smartest yacht basin—a port  of call for the man who likes sleek  cruisers and trim sailing craft. Across  a narrow strip of land from Bahia-  Mar is the open ocean and one of  the finest beaches in South Florida.  See Fort Lauderdale by day as a  masterpiece in marine and tropical  tones; see it by night for the fantasy  of lights along the waterways.  The tile and stucco homes behind  the bougainvilleas are among the  cleanest you'll ever see; not a single  lump of coal is burned in Fort  Lauderdale.

For looks alone,  it is an attraction for all visitors.  It is cited here because it typifies  the civic planning which produced  a city with the beauty of Coral  Gables. Boulevards are lined with  Mediterranean and Spanish style  buildings; suburbs include Dutch  South African and Chinese compound-types, but all fit a pattern  planned before construction began.  Plazas, parks, schools, churches and  even stores blend into the setting.  The Miracle Mile part of Coral  Way, downtown, is Florida's newest  street of ultra-smart shops.  Oddly enough, a Cape Cod minister who fled icy winters for his  health inspired the idea and started  the work of building a city for professional men. Today thousands of  leaders in business and professional  circles have homes in Coral Gables.  Tamiami Trail —Naples  The Everglades are vast, spreading from the tip of Florida to Lake  Okeechobee. Bisecting the glades is  the Tamiami Trail, a modern highway from Miami to the Gulf of  Mexico at Naples, about a hundred  miles.  Traveling this section of the trail  makes a fine day's outing, by rental  car or bus. Leave early, to see the  morning flights of water birds. Have  a swim and lunch and perhaps a bit  of fishing at Naples, then return in  the afternoon. Traffic is generally  light. Occasionally you pass an Indian village or clump of buildings.  But mostly, sheer wilderness.  For miles, you parallel the Tamiami Canal which is packed with  fish so big you can see them from  your car. Twenty-pound snook, for  instance. At several points, you'll  find places to rent swamp buggies  (as on page 34) for a thrilling ride  along canals and lakes.  Naples is a fishing port famous  for tarpon and pompano. Good accommodations, charter boats by day  or half-day and a 1,000 foot fishing  pier. Golf for non-fishermen, too.  Louisiana Heron is one of myriad types of  water fowl seen on Tamiami Trail.  36 		image/tiff						42058815 Bytes	2925	4793	1971561538	RGB	8	600	asc99990000100036001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/552	552	553.jp2	/pamphlets/image/553.jp2

The key the Spanish  named "Cayo Heuso" is only about  two miles wide and five miles long.  A quiet little town that sleeps in the  sun, it's worth visiting for the drive  alone.  Years ago, a railroad was bridged  over the keys, with a car ferry from  Key West to Havana. Then a hurricane wrecked the railroad and at a  cost of some $49,000,000 the route  was turned into an automobile  highway.  You ride just above the waves,  the Atlantic on one side, the Gulf  of Mexico on the other. You pass  Key Largo, scene of the Hemingway  book and Bogart-Bacall picture; you  drive alternately over open water  and then down the length of low-  lying keys —Long Key, Pigeon Key,  Key Vaca, Boca Chica and Sisters  Key and Big Pine Key — an amphibious avenue of green waves and  green jungle peopled mainly by  pelicans and gulls.  The little island that is now the  Gibraltar of the Gulf was sold by  Don Juan Pablo Salas to an American for only $2,000. A part of the  United States now, it is actually still  more Spanish than anything else —  in houses, habits of siestas and food.  You relax in the "manana" atmosphere, eat conch chowder, crawfish, turtle steaks and top them off  with lime pie. You watch the sponge  fleets come in. And if you walk the  length of Duval Street you will have  hiked from the Atlantic Ocean to the  Gulf of Mexico. "Believe It or Not"  calls it the longest street in the  world, for that reason.

Miami is the air and sea gateway  to the Bahamas, Cuba, islands of  the Caribbean and Latin America.  Nassau and Havana are only an  hour away by air. Jamaica, Haiti,  Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands  are from a few hours to half-a-day  away.  It's an excellent opportunity to  spend a day, a weekend or a week  in a foreign land. You can land on  islands where Columbus landed,  cruise the area where European  powers in Elizabethan times fought  for control of the Spanish Main.  You'll talk to colorful natives, with  the soft slur of foreign tongues;  try new foods, shop for native  wares.  American citizens don't need a  passport most places in the Caribbean. Nor will a health and vaccination certificate be needed in  the Bahamas and Cuba. Other spots  may require a certificate, so check  your travel agent for ruling before  you depart.  Puerto Rico, being a territory of  the U.S.A., requires nothing of U.S.  citizens.  48-hour visitors can bring in $200  worth of goods duty free; visitors  staying 12 days may bring in $500  worth without duty. But no more  than one gallon of spirits. U.S. dollars are good everywhere.  All-expense tours are available to  some of the islands but may not  always be available during winter  season. Best bet: see your travel  agent, get confirmed reservations  and travel care-free.  Bahamas  Nassau, centuries-old capital of  the islands, is on 19-mile long New  Providence Island.

It shares  the island of Hispaniola with Haiti.  You can reach Ciudad Trujillo, the  capital, in less than an hour from  Port-au-Prince. The capital, once  called Santo Domingo and oldest  city in the western hemisphere, is  modern and spotless. It's been rebuilt since 1931, but all the famous  Spanish ruins were kept intact.

You pass jungles full of orchids,  drive over volcanic mountains that  rise to 7,000 feet—their flanks covered by plantations of sugar, pineapples, coffee and bananas.  In Kingston, shops are excellent  for British woolens, sweaters, leather  goods, perfumes and gloves. The  colonial atmosphere of the island is  charming. Natives are friendly, courteous and in general well educated.  Their English accents are wonderful.  You'll like exploring the island,  also the superb swimming, fishing,  sailing, golf, tennis and riding.  British Overseas Airways, 309 E. Flagler   St.      .      .

In fact, the entire island is a  contrast; mountains covered with  wild growth, neat acres of sugar  cane; bustling cities, long, open  stretches of tropical shore; modern  station wagons and primitive ox  carts.  Life is enlivened with casinos,  lotteries, cockfights and horse races.  Island roads are excellent, so that  it is easy to extend a visit from San  Juan to cover all the historic and  scenic highlights of the island.  Air service only between Miami  and San Juan via Pan American  Airways or Eastern Air Lines.  Virgin Islands  Southeast of Puerto Rico a half  hour by air is a group of over a  hundred islands in the Caribbean.  Columbus found them, called them  the Virgin Islands. They are off the  beaten track; many of the smaller  islands are uninhabited. The others  are trim, neat and beautiful, for  they combine Caribbean scenery  with Danish settlement.  The three main islands under  U.S. control are St. Croix, St.  Thomas and St. John. They are  balmy, breeze-swept and life is at  the leisurely tempo of the tropics.  Fine hotels are a recent addition,  with a smartly cosmopolitan air and  many visitors whose names are  news.  Aside from inter-island fishing  schooners, the only way to reach  the Virgin Islands is by air, through  San Juan, to either Charlotte Amalie  or Christiansted. Special circle tours  are available on both Pan American  Airways and Eastern Air Lines.

Nowhere else in all the cities of the  sun, in fact in few cities of the  world, do you have such a wide  choice for gay, exciting evenings —  for dining, dancing and romancing,  for mingling with celebrities, for  being entertained in regal style.  The clubs are many, and diverse.  They range from cozy to colossal,  from big-name acts of Manhattan  and Hollywood to tropical natives  beating out new rhythms, from old-  time burlesque to modern sophistication. You can enjoy different food,  music and entertainment every  night—no matter how long you stay.  Prices vary. You may have a cocktail or a nightcap in a small place  where an amiable pianist knows all  your favorite tunes. Or you may  have a dinner, with champagne, in  a club that has a famous orchestra,  chorus girls and a two-hour show of  star talent. The checks would vary  . . . considerably.  It's a good idea, if you want to  plan a perfect evening and are undecided about an itinerary, to call up  a few clubs and ask for details.  They'll be glad to tell you whether  or not there is a cover charge, how  much it is, the price range of dinners, the type of show for the evening. The amusement pages of  Miami papers also carry details.  The editor of this book will recommend Florida sunshine in glowing  terms, swear to the size of fish you  can catch in the Gulf Stream and  guarantee gala fashion shows.

Some restaurants serve shrimp by  the hundreds on big turkey platters.  Fish from the Gulf Stream are on  plates in a matter of hours. Pompano  is a favorite of gourmets but you  can enjoy new types for meal after  meal. Stone crabs are a Florida specialty. There's also a type of lobster,  a native of Florida waters, that will  enchant you. Smoked game fish is a  treat.  Miami is also a barbecue capital.  Spanish, Creole and Indian spices  are blended together and added to  spare ribs with a special Florida  flair.  You may be surprised to learn  that Florida is the biggest ranching  and beef cattle state east of the Mississippi. The beef supply is excellent, tender and prime.  Many winter visitors, however,  rank the fresh fruit and vegetables—  especially the tropical varieties —at  the top of the treat list. Miami is  surrounded by citrus groves and  fields by the square mile of strawberries and all sorts of vegetables.  They come to your table at the peak  of ripeness, the way you may pick  them from your own garden during  the summer.  Market stalls and restaurant menus  tempt you with mangos, pineapples,  coconut, papaya, avocados, persimmons and pomegranates.  Then, there are the foreign dishes.

The  big theatres downtown carry all the  latest shows and there are smaller  motion picture houses scattered all  over Miami and its suburbs. You're  also apt to find many of the stars  next to you on the beach or dining  at an adjoining table, since they  like Miami vacations, too.  Music and the Arts  Few cities can match the music  fare of Miami during the winter season. Famed artists appear in individual concerts, operas, symphonies.  Broadway shows featuring professional talent are scheduled at several theaters.  One or more of Greater Miami's  four modern auditoriums offer some  form of entertainment almost daily. 		image/tiff						42234315 Bytes	2925	4813	374343685	RGB	8	600	asc99990000100044001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/560	560	561.jp2	/pamphlets/image/561.jp2

And it's a healthy spot that  makes you healthier. At the same  time, it's reassuring to know the  Dade County Medical Association  has a public service whereby visitors  can get a doctor or dentist any time  of day or night by phoning 82-7512.  Ambulances are two-way radio dispatched; there are 22 American  Medical Association-registered hospitals in Greater Miami. Miami is  one vacation spot that really guards  the health of its visitors, not only  with available doctors and hospitals,  but also in careful checks on bathing  beaches, water supply, food and  beverages, restaurant employees.  Money and Checks  Experienced travelers usually  carry their funds in the form of Travelers' Cheques. They avoid loss, they  cost only 75c for each $100. Main  advantage is that you don't need to  be identified to cash them anywhere, anytime, for full face value.  Your signature is your identification.  49 		image/tiff						41829855 Bytes	2885	4833	3610527711	RGB	8	600	asc99990000100049001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/565	565	566.jp2	/pamphlets/image/566.jp2

Because so many visitors  come for the entire winter, the  schools are open to visitors' children  without payment of tuition fees.  This ruling applies to public elementary, junior and senior high  schools.  There are many private schools,  for children of all ages, for short-  term instruction. Data on private  schools should be requested through  Chamber of Commerce.  The University of Miami is in  nearby Coral Gables. From mid-  June to mid-September there are  two summer sessions which have  proven especially popular with  teachers, who can combine professional advancement with a vacation  in the tropics. Miami's proximity to  the Caribbean countries is an added  attraction to those who wish to  travel further after classes end.  Stock Brokers  Several firms who are members of  the New York Stock Exchange or  New York Curb Exchange, as well  as the commodity exchanges, have  branch offices in Miami and Miami  Beach. They have all the ticker and  trading services of the main offices.  Women's Clubs  Visitors to Miami are always welcomed at the Women's Clubs, either  in Miami or Miami Beach. Here  club women from all over the country meet to exchange ideas and find  out what other clubs are doing.  Programs of special interest to visitors are frequent.

For aside  from the new styles and new fabrics,  apart from the news of whether hem  lines and neck lines will rise or fall,  it is the setting which makes Miami  shows so superb.  You go to one of the famed hotels;  you sit on the terrace beneath royal  poincianas and coconut palms, with  the blue waters of the Atlantic as a  backdrop, the tiled walks of a pool  as the stage, and an orchestra of  softly muted strings playing beneath  ^e flame vines and jasmine. And  there, in this combination setting of  blue water, tropical foliage and  sharply modern lines of towering  glass and steel and stone, the styles  of the future are paraded before  you. Paris can't match it, New York  can only imitate it indoors, none of  the style centers of the world can  stage a fashion show in the Miami  manner.  Miami in the winter has long been  the showplace for the styles of next  summer in beach wear and sun  clothes. But in recent years, the  shows have been expanded and now  include everything from sun togs to  furs and formal evening attire. Also,  a complete line of children's clothes.  There are now 65 Florida manufacturers who are members of the  Miami Fashion Council. In addition  to this fashion group, the Miami  branches of smart shops from all the  major cities take part in the season's  presentations.

Shopping Areas  Bisecting Miami Beach is a shopping thoroughfare called Lincoln  Boad. Time was when it was called  the Bue de la Paix of the western  world, or when it was likened to  Fifth Avenue or Michigan Boulevard for smart shops. But not now.  Now it is Lincoln Boad. It stands  alone, in a class of its own. Paris,  New York, London, Chicago, Hollywood, boast of products shown on  Lincoln Boad.  It's a long street, a wide street,  a street of immaculate grooming,  lined by buildings of modern archi  tecture, shaded by royal palms set  in a neatly parked strip between  sidewalk and curb.  On Lincoln Boad you'll find the  name shops of the world. Furs, diamonds, gowns, woolens, shoes,  leathers, china, beach clothes, automobiles, neckties, scarfs, hats, cameras, cruisers — everything is there.  Miles of wonderful window shopping, miles of wonderful wares.  Collins Avenue is the other big  shopping street of Miami Beach.  You'll also find most of the hotels  have sun shops off the lobby.  In Miami, the shopping area centers around Flagler Street from  Biscayne Bay on inland. Stores specializing in Florida fruits for shipment to friends up North are found  all over Greater Miami.  Lincoln Road, Miami Beach, is lined with smart shops of the world 		image/tiff						41829855 Bytes	2885	4833	4016564797	RGB	8	600	asc99990000100052001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/568	568	569.jp2	/pamphlets/image/569.jp2

It is delightfully situated on Biscayne Bay, on the  East coast of Florida. Ten years ago the population of  Miami was very small, but it has had rapid growth of  late years, and its population now numbers about ten  thousand.  Its fine hotels, including The Royal Palm, The Halcyon,  and The Gralynn are crowded during the winter season.  The Royal Palm is one of the most beautifully situated  hotels in the world, facing the ocean and lying between  the waters of Biscayne Bay and the Atlantic.  The gleaming pink and white of the coral formation  of the streets of Miami, and the beautiful green of the  foliage of the Palms, Orange trees, Grape Fruit trees,  Palmettos, etc., and the brilliant colors of the Poinsettia,  Hibiscus and other tropical flowers makes the scene a brilliant one. A great many people from the North are building bungalows in the environs of Miami for winter homes.  There has been considerable developement in the  neighborhood of Miami in the draining of the Everglades,  and in the recourse to fruit raising and truck farming.  Miami is also a busy commercial center for the surrounding population.  The completion of the Extension of the Florida East  Coast Railway to Knight's Key, is an important event  in the progress of Florida. This road was built at a great  expenditure of capital and is the only sea-going railway  in the world. It is built from Key West to Knight's  Key, and viaducts and bridges are laid on the floor of  the ocean, and connect the small Islets called the Florida  Keys. Some of the interesting features of this Railway  are the Bahia Honda Bridge, the Long Key Viaduct,  which is two and two-third miles long, and the Knight's  Key Bridge. By this route the traveler en route to  Havana spends only one night at sea, taking the steamer  at Knight's Key and arriving in Havana in a few hours. 		image/tiff						57388350 Bytes	5330	3589	1991123556	RGB	8	600	asc99990000220003001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/586	586	587.jp2	/pamphlets/image/587.jp2

It is bounded on the north and east  by the City of Miami and on the south by  Biscayne Bay. It consists of sixteen square  miles of territory or about 10,000 acres, is  but five years old and has approximately  10,000 population, a thriving business community, upwards of 4,000 buildings, and has  invested in buildings and development upwards  of $150,000,000. It is "below the frost line," in  the only Tropics in America, where the climate  is that of summer the whole year through.  Coral Gables is the dominant residential  suburban unit of Greater Miami, where hundreds of Miami's leaders in business, financial,  professional and social affairs make their  homes, together with a strong permanent  representation of families drawn from practically every State in the Union. Miami is the  commercial metropolis of tropical Southeastern  Florida. Its entire area and all its environs,  with especial reference to Coral Gables, are  within forty hours' railway journey and two  days by ocean steamship, of seventy-five per  cent of the population and wealth of the  United States. It is tapped by two great railway lines and by the steamship service of  America's great Atlantic ports. It is readily  accessible by motor from all parts of the  Atlantic  Seaboard  of Florida.  Coral Gables is connected with Miami by a  rapid transit inter urban electric railway  system, by an electric street railway, and by an  imposing number of great, well-paved trunk  highways where motor travel is a positive joy.  It has public utilities of wide scope and high  order, power, light, water, and all municipal  services. Aside from its permanent residential  population, its year 'round facilities for outdoor  sports, recreations and enjoyment are unexcelled anywhere in all America.  Historically, Coral Gables is unique among  American cities. Its founder is George E.  Merrick. More than thirty years ago his  father, a Congregational minister of Cape Cod.  came here with his family to escape the icy  Northern winters and their attendant ills, and  established a fruit grove. The elder Merrick,  now gone to his rest, selected the 160-acre tract  which was to become the nucleus of this city,  because it was high land, with rich, fertile  soil, underlaid with solid coral and relatively  free from insect pests.  Benefited greatly in health by reason of this  incomparable climate, he planned to establish a  professional colony of small tracts for such men  as  himself.    Carrying  on  the  work  he  laid 		image/tiff						120529590 Bytes	5550	7239	3891391816	RGB	8	600	asc99990000020004001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/630	630	631.jp2	/pamphlets/image/631.jp2

Merrick,  having abandoned his training  and   education   in   law   and  literature  in  the  North,   set  before   himself   the   ideal   of  building a model city wherein  nothing   should be   unlovely.  In   November   of   1921,   his  original holdings having been  expanded   gradually  to 3,000  acres,  the project of his life  was launched.    So greatly did  it succeed, that on April  29,  1925, Coral Gables was incorporated through the legislature  of Florida, as a city in its own right.    Today,  the assessed valuation of its taxable property  is $92,250,312, with a rate of only 13^ mills  on fifty per cent of the fair market value of  land unimproved, improvements not being  taxed.  It is the centre of a complete educational  system, with nine public and private schools,  ranging from kindergarten to university.    It  has six fine modern hotels, among them the  Miami Biltmore, a $10,000,000 plant operated  by   America's   premier  hotel   magnate,   John  McEntee Bowman.    It has hundreds of miles  of paved streets and sidewalks and white-way  lighting, 297 acres of the finest golf courses in  America,   swimming  pools  which  are   famed  throughout   the   continent   and   the   widest  conceivable  opportunity  for  other  forms   of  outdoor enjoyment for every day in the year.  Cultural, religious and community progress  has kept pace with material enhancement of  property values pushed forward by construction   and   development   programs   of   great  magnitude.    In addition to its complete school  system, there are eight religious congregations  in   Coral   Gables,   organized   by   the   major  denominations.    Coral Gables Congregational  The Bank of Coral Gables  Church is an edifice of noted  beauty; the other congregations have secured sites and  plan buildings for the near  future, none of which is to cost  less than $100,000. Civic  Clubs, Women's Clubs, Garden  Clubs and kindred organizations pursue varied and manifold activity.  Coral Gables is in truth a  city beautiful, and substantial  withal.    Its homes are set in  First National Bank  Typical Business Building  wide spaces, vast lawns and tropical landscaping of captivating verdure. Its spacious, beautified plazas, its magnificent gateways, its broad,  winding, tree-shaded boulevards and streets,  and tinkling fountains are a delight to behold.  The skill of America's nationally known  architects and the consummate, deft assurance  of master-artists has been applied to the preservation of stability, utility and beauty. Rigid  restrictions ensure structural strength, climatic  comfort, harmony of type and color and landscape. Thus it is that Coral Gables attracts to  itself of America's best. 		image/tiff						121195590 Bytes	5550	7279	3993494615	RGB	8	600	asc99990000020005001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/631	631	632.jp2	/pamphlets/image/632.jp2

When the blizzards are blowing in the North,  when the mercury sinks to zero or below, when  the North wind moans and howls, it is summertime in Coral Gables, and all outdoors is  calling.  Here, less than forty hours from the  thickly-settled areas which hold 75 per cent  of America's population, you can play outdoors  in the sunshine all winter through. The annual  mean temperature as recorded by the United  States Wreather Bureau station in Miami, is  74.4 degrees. The highest average monthly  temperature in 1925 was 82 in August—the  lowest, 68 in January—and the average January temperature is the same as the average  June temperature for Atlantic City, N. J., and  one degree higher than the average June temperature in Los Angeles, Cal. The climate is  equable, summer and winter extremes unknown. A day without sunshine is so unusual  an occurrence as invariably to cause comment,  for sunshine occurs on an average 359 out of  the 365 days of the year. In 1925, for instance,  there was but one day entirely without sunshine. Picture, then, the continuous opportunity for all forms of outdoor recreation.  Coral Gables has so built and established its  facilities for capitalizing the vitalizing tropic  sunshine as to enable its residents and visitors  to reap the fullest benefit of tropic sun and  Caribbean breezes. When the snow is flying  in the North, the inviting green sward of vast  golf courses planned by master architects is  thronged with eager devotees of the "royal  and ancient game".  In the Granada golf course of the Coral  Gables Golf and Country Club, reaching  throughout the heart of the older residential  sections, there are fifty-eight acres that tempt  the soul and test the skill of the ardent golf  enthusiast. Reaching southward along winding waterways through the Biltmore and  Riviera sections of the city down toward the  campus of the University of Miami, are two  more eighteen-hole golf courses embracing 239  acres—a total of 297 acres where you can  play practically every day in the year. 		image/tiff						120196590 Bytes	5550	7219	3756707436	RGB	8	600	asc99990000020006001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/632	632	633.jp2	/pamphlets/image/633.jp2
Page 7																																	asc9999000002	asc99990000020007001		In the Coral Gables Golf and Country Club,  you can enjoy the charming dinner-dances in  the Spanish Dance Gardens every night in the  year, with the star-lit sky for a canopy, and  the soft South-sea breezes riffling the fronds of  the coconut palms. You can dine on the open  patios of the hotels, or join the brilliant social  activity of the Miami Biltmore and the Biltmore Country Club.  Wlien the lakes and rivers of the North are  ice-bound, you can swim in the Venetian  Casino, the Miami Biltmore swimming pool,  the charming South-seas lagoon of Tahiti Beach  on Biscayne Bay, or go surf-bathing at Cape  Florida or the fine Atlantic beaches, in water  with a temperature above 70 degrees. The  Venetian Casino with its limpid pool, its  splashing waterfalls, its upthrust coral diving-  towers, its wonderfully tinted stuccos, its  delightful patio for dining and dancing, has  been described aptly as "the most beautiful  swimmin' hole in the world." It justifies that  description. Its beauties cannot be depicted  in mere words. All winter long, all year  through, from dawn till long after the sun has  set and brilliant flood-lights illumine a scene  of breath-taking picturesqueness, the Venetian  Pool is the mecca of young and old, of swimmers and of artists, of experts and novices.  You can ride horseback over endless, winding bridle-paths—tree-shaded, flower-decked.  A Bit ^ and Spur Club is a feature of Coral  Gables' social and recreational life and lovers  of the equine can find available the best of  mounts.  Riding the Bridle-Paths in Coral Gables  Tennis, boating, canoeing, yachting, cruising across blue waters in the flashing speedboats, bowling on the green, football, baseball,  fishing, hiking or motoring—you can cover the  whole gamut of the sports-lover's lexicon in  Coral Gables, winter or summer, practically  any day in the year.  If you are a lover of the sport of kings, you  will find Coral Gables the ideal central point  from which to radiate, to the famous horse  races of the Miami Jockey Club, or to the  Havana track in twelve hours. The Greater  Miami area is, veritably, America's winter  playgound—horse racing, the swift greyhound  racing, the flashing speed of the ancient Spanish  game of Jai-Alai, the annual Biscayne Bay  yacht races, the gripping, thrilling thunder of  hoofs upon the polo field.  And in the evenings you can participate in  the joyous night-life and music and dancing at  the hotels and the country clubs, the swift,  smooth purr of powerful motors over scores of  miles of splendid highways aflood with tropic  moonlight, or canoeing through dark shadows  flung by ghostly trees over silent, winding  waterways.  Coral Gables welcomes the winter visitor,  with complete facilities for entertainment, for  sports, and for the comfort and relaxation that  America's Only Tropics affords for those who  seek the sunshine.  The fine hotels, the 102 apartment houses,  meet all tastes and preferences, with a range  of rates and prices to fit the limited as well  as the unlimited income. You can play in  winter, in Coral Gables. 		image/tiff						120095250 Bytes	5530	7239	463908686	RGB	8	600	asc99990000020007001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/633	633	634.jp2	/pamphlets/image/634.jp2

There can be no truer index of progress,  in any city, than the volume of building, the  permits being taken as a standard yardstick  the world over. During the first ten months  of 1926, permits totalled $12,629,412, and for  the full twelve months of 1925, $25,890,515.  There are now within the city limits of  Coral Gables nearly 4,000 structures, including  2,792 private homes and apartment blocks and  garages, 112 office, store and commercial, and  industrial buildings, eleven school buildings, six  hotels, ten public buildings, two hospital buildings, two university buildings, twelve amusement buildings and club-houses and many  other structures. Completed homes and apartments now accommodate 2,153 families.  In volume of building construction Miami  was the twelfth city in the United States  during the first half of 1926, and in the same  period, Coral Gables' building volume nearly  equalled that of Miami. These statistics and  others appearing in other pages of this booklet  establish beyond any dispute that Coral Gables  is a city of permanency, stability and continuous progress.  A list of members of the Coral Gables  Contractors Association shows that there are  sixty-two members, building contractors operating in Coral Gables, many of them concerns  of great prominence in cities of the North. In  addition, there are 140 sub-contractors at  work in building construction in this city.  Of the total volume of permits issued in  1926 to October 31, Uj4 per cent or $1,857,559,  were for business or industrial structures. A  considerable volume of residential and public  building is now in progress. The most outstanding business structure being pushed to  completion is the Colonnade Building at the  intersection of two main streets—Ponce de  Leon Boulevard and Coral Way—at a cost of  $600,000. Another most important structure  is the Douglas Entrance, an imposing main  gateway to the city embodying the Don  Quixote Apartments and a series of Spanish  shops, at a cost of approximately $1,000,000.  Coral Gables is a city of imposing buildings,  including a handsome elementary school in  five units; three great units of a county high  school, the Miami Biltmore Hotel, topped by  Colonial Homes, Avenue Santa Maria 		image/tiff						117378270 Bytes	5390	7259	1617273976	RGB	8	600	asc99990000020009001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/635	635	636.jp2	/pamphlets/image/636.jp2

The Douglas entrance is being erected by  John B. Orr, Inc.—Mr. Orr being a city commissioner of the city of Miami, a leading  builder of Florida, and a notable figure in  International Rotary. Indicative also of the  type and character of Coral Gables builders,  is the American Building Corporation, with the  Myers Y. Cooper Company, a group of Cincinnati capitalists who are operating upon a  $75,000,000 program and who already have  built eighty of their first hundred homes, at a  cost of $3,000,000. Estimated costs of the  building projects of twenty-three leading contractors, covering a period of years, runs over  $150,000,000.  Building in Coral Gables is of the permanent type. Buildings are supervised as  to architectural planning, structural strength,  weather-resisting quality, and quality of workmanship and materials. In these respects all  structures must measure up to exacting requirements laid down by the board of architects headed by Phineas E.  Paist, A.  I.  A.  A Group of Small Homes, Avenue Aragon  The regulations apply equally to residences  as to business buildings.  Type and design are also regulated, with the  result that Coral Gables has been built into an  astonishing old-world city, veritably transplanted into a new-wo rid setting, with all the  utility comfort, convenience and rugged  strength required to meet every exigency.  Coral Gables homes resist the worst assaults  of elemental fury and meet any exigency of  storm and stress, with even their external  beauties unimpaired. Art and color, even to  the types and colors of awnings and shrubs, is  regulated and supervised.  It is a significant fact that a great proportion of the new building in Coral Gables  is in the more recently developed sections,  notably in the famous Riviera section, which is  the centre of great development in public  improvements, and of important institutional  buildings, such as the University, the Ponce  de Leon High School, the Cocoplum Women's  Club's $100,000 building, and other structures.  Built under a rigid code, supervised as to  structural strength by a leading architect of  America, directed as to artistry by Denman  Fink, an artist of national note, and all maintaining a high standard of quality, strength  and artistry, Coral Gables building, like the  city of Coral Gables, is as firm as the coral  foundation on which it stands.

Page 11																																	asc9999000002	asc99990000020011001		Where Development Is Unremitting  ||ijp|^WO of the largest contracts ever let  PIEPfl in Florida, calling for a total of  W+*¥) $3,300,000 to be expended in development and improvements, were awarded by  Coral Gables during August and September of  1926. One was a contract for the construction  of paved streets and sidewalks, costing  $1,800,000, let to W. T. Price, Inc. The other  was a contract for $1,500,000 worth of dredging  in the creation of waterways and roadbeds,  let to the T. T. Sweet Dredging Co., Inc.  Those contracts are symbolic, typical and  characteristic of Coral Gables' progress in  development work. It is a fact that not one  dollar of profit has been taken from this work  of city building by the officers of Coral Gables  Corporation—every dollar has been put right  back into the property, together with many  additional dollars, for the purpose of building  values and enhancing the value of the holdings  of every investor in Coral Gables.    Such has  been, is, and will be the policy for many years  to come.  During the past five years, no matter what  happened, Coral Gables kept on working.  When all Florida seemed to be in the grip of a  speculative fever, road gangs laid the broad  highways and built the street railway and  rapid transit lines that knit this city in indissoluble bonds to Miami. Flagler Street, the  Tamiami Trail, Coral Way, the East and  West Dixie Highways, the network of streets  and boulevards that spread their spider-web  throughout this area, went ahead with vigor.  During all the fluctuations of business, dredges  clattered, steam shovels roared and dump  trucks thundered along the palm-fringed roads.  During the five years up to August, 1926,  a vast system of perfectly planned streets had  been laid out, boulevards and parkways  cleared, planted and landscaped, golf courses  created, costly, stately gateways and entrances 		image/tiff						118464030 Bytes	5470	7219	938678162	RGB	8	600	asc99990000020011001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/637	637	638.jp2	/pamphlets/image/638.jp2

Although there were eighty-six miles of  paved streets and ninety miles of sidewalks  in Coral Gables a few months ago, a new  contract was let August 18th to W. T. Price,  Inc., for fifty-one additional miles of streets  and 181 miles of sidewalks, to be completed  within 200 days. The work has proceeded on  schedule. At the end of October, 1926, Coral  Gables had 100 miles of paved streets completed, with thirty-one miles more nearing completion; it had also 125 miles of sidewalks  completed, with 150 more under way. Fourteen miles of streets carried white-way lighting,  with twenty-five miles more under way.  Coral Gables has Gulf Stream and ocean  frontage extending from Bear Cut, at the  northern end of Key Biscayne, to the northern  end of Sand Key, a distance of fifteen miles  and including Key Biscayne, Soldier Key and  Ragged Keys. Key Biscayne, within the city  of Coral Gables, has three miles of ocean  frontage and three miles of bay frontage.  Along the mainland Coral Gables has over  five miles of actual Biscayne Bay frontage and  it will have, when completed, over forty miles  of actual lot frontage on its inland waterway  system. A great part of the inland waterway  system, from the Hotel Biltmore to the Bay,  had been excavated prior to September, 1926,  and on September 10th, a contract was let to the  T. T. Sweet Dredging Company, for approximately 2,458,950 cubic yards of dredging, to  cost $1,500,000. Work was begun immediately  and has progressed on schedule.  Coral Gables began five years ago, with a  fifteen-year program of development and improvement. At the end of five years, it has  passed the mark set for that period. It is  estimated that more than $125,000,000 has been  expended in building entrances, plazas, roads,  public buildings, utilities and other construction in Coral Gables.  Five to eight years of continual development and building lies before Coral Gables,  before there can be regarded as complete the  great program which George E. Merrick has  set before himself for the perfect American  city, blending in its motifs all the beautiful  which can be found in Spain, the Riviera,  Northern Africa, Venice, in fact all of the  lands bordering on the tropical or the Mediterranean.  While there is the unremitting forward  march toward a never-forgotten ideal, there is  also a very practical side to the development  which has taken, is taking, and will take place.  Every dollar placed into this great development program, enhances the value of every  purchaser's investment. Enhancing values  follow logically where there is great expenditure of money in unstinted improvements.  That is an important consideration for the  investor, and one which is fully realized, if one  may judge by the only logical index, namely,  the steadily increasing population, the growing  number of homes, and the vast increase in  building and in business establishments which  marks the Coral Gables of today.

In addition to the County Elementary School and the Ponce de Leon  University High School, also under the Dade  County School Commission, there is a high-  class military academy in Coral Gables; an  academy of the Sisters of St. Joseph Catholic  Order, the Montemare School, a branch of the  famous school of the same name at Lake  Placid, N. Y., the University of Miami and a  number of private kindergarten schools.  Primary and secondary schools furnish in  every city the keenest opportunity for insight  as to the make-up of that city's population  and the state of its growth or otherwise. It is  a fact, based upon figures publicly announced  by the Dade County School Commission, that  sixty per cent of Dade County's total increase  in high school enrollment in 1926 over 1925, is  in Coral Gables High School. There are sixteen high schools in Dade County. In 1925  the Ponce de Leon High School enrollment was  six per cent of Dade County's total—and at  the opening of the 1926 semester, the Ponce  de Leon High School enrollment had risen to  ten per cent of Dade County's total number of  pupils in high schools. The register showed a  great number of  transfers from other  Dade  County high schools, and four-fifths of such  transfers proved to be those of pupils whose  parents had, since 1925, moved to new homes  in Coral Gables.  In the primary school a similar condition  was revealed. In these two schools combined  there were, at the opening of the 1926 semester,  two hundred and eighty new pupils transferred from other parts of Greater Miami. In  addition, the registers showed two hundred  and eighty-one pupils newly registered, who  last attended school in other States in the  Union outside of Florida. No fewer than  thirty States are represented, and in one class,  the senior, graduating class at the high school,  new pupils represented seventeen different  States.  Here is a point of great significance. Their  former Northern addresses were taken in order  that their scholastic records of the 1925 semester could be checked for grading here. These  pupils represent entirely new residents of Coral  Gables. All last winter they attended Northern schools. This winter they are in Coral  Gables—and well in advance of the normal  tide of winter sojourners. Enrollment in these  two schools increased seventy-five per cent  over 1925.  These figures establish two things beyond  dispute—firstly, the trend of population in  Greater Miami is south and west, to Coral  Gables; secondly, Coral Gables is drawing to its 		image/tiff						127853007 Bytes	5871	7259	1485708409	RGB	8	600	asc99990000020015001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/641	641	642.jp2	/pamphlets/image/642.jp2

There are  many sound and cogent reasons that will appeal  to the sound sense of any thinking man, for  that assertion.  In the first place, Coral Gables is, demonstrably, in the logical path of Greater Miami's  greater growth. Miami is expanding and must  expand, as the South's commercial metropolis.  Her logical pathway is south and west. Already she envelopes Coral Gables on two sides;  already her leading bankers, lawyers, professional men and business and social leaders  make their homes in Coral Gables. Coral  Gables is the most accessible suburban residential unit of all Greater Miami; she has rapid  transit, electric railway and multitudinous  highway connections. And Coral Gables is  on solid rock, is sturdily built, on the highest  land in Dade County. She has the climate to  attract from the North, as well as from Greater  Miami; she has the educational facilities, the  self-contained business area for her own development; and abundant suburban residential  space away from the commercial encroachment  that has created Miami's demand for elbow-  room. She has the comfort, the homes, the  outdoor recreational and sports opportunities,  the avenues of attraction for winter visitors,  and the absence of traffic problems by reason  of scientific city planning.  It is no economic accident, but economic  logic, the irresistible force of economic circumstance, that compels the growth of Coral  Gables—economic logic helped by the pressing  forward of an ideal, by means of a consistent  program of vast and costly development. And  the proofs of the pudding are in the eating.  They are to be found in the evidences of expansion, measure them by whatever customary  yardstick you will.  In the twenty-two months ending October  31, 1926, building in Coral Gables has totalled  $38,519,927. In the ten months ending  October 31, 1926, building totalled $12,629,-  412, Uy2 per cent of which, or $1,857,559  was for business structures.  Business licenses issued in Coral Gables in  1926, up to April 30, 1926, totalled 350 for 42  lines of business; at September 15th, there were  504 licenses for 86 lines of business. And at  October 31st, there were 592 licenses for 106  distinct lines of business. Today residents of  Coral Gables can build, furnish and decorate  their homes without going outside of their city  to buy a single article. Their clothes, food,  motor cars, and every need of living, are supplied by their local merchant. In addition to  the permanent residents and the yearly flood 		image/tiff						118025070 Bytes	5390	7299	1932887540	RGB	8	600	asc99990000020017001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/643	643	644.jp2	/pamphlets/image/644.jp2

Values are maintained and enhanced where  large sums are expended in continuous development. $3,300,000 is being expended in two  development contracts alone, let since August  18th, in Coral Gables. Its building and development plans never have halted; its plans for  even greater improvements are moving steadily forward, and business activity is profitable  and increasing steadily in volume.  The Bank of Coral Gables, which on  September 15th, had slightly more than 3,000  accounts and $1,250,000 on deposit and $20,000  surplus—on November 5, 1926, had 4,000  depositors, $1,400,000 on deposit and $35,000  surplus. In addition, the First National Bank  of Coral Gables, one of the strong group surrounding the First National Bank of Miami,  entered Coral Gables business life in November, 1926.  The University of Miami opened on October 15, 1926, and has 980 students—and the  primary and secondary schools show seventy-  five per cent increase in enrollment in 1926  over 1925.  Another index is found in telephone statistics. In January, 1925, there were forty  telephone instruments installed in Coral Gables.  By January, 1926, the number had increased  to  694.    Nine  months  later,   in  September,  1926, the number had again increased to  1,475—-and the company forecasts, basing its  expansion plans on the forecast, an increase of  nearly eighty per cent in another year, another  increase of fifty per cent in the two following  years, and another of more than forty per cent in  the two next succeeding years. These figures  are significant because of their direct relation  to population.  In April, 1925, there were 700 electric  meters in Coral Gables—in December, 1925,  1,521, and in October, 1926, more than  3,000. Coral Gables water and electrical services are operated by the Florida Power and  Light Corporation, which has expended some  $20,000,000 in expansion in the Greater Miami  area in the last two years. It is a subsidiary  of the Electric Bond and Share Corporation of  New York—the "Super-Power Project"; such  corporations do not expand, nor expend, without economic investigation and assurance.  These are the proofs cf economic stability,  the reasonable assurance of safe investment,  the indication of profitable enterprise, in Coral  Gables. Five years ago the first lot was sold  in Coral Gables. Today it is a city, with an  assessed valuation of more than $92,000,000,  with more than $150,000,000 invested in  building and development, with an estimated  10,000 population and further development  programs assured.  Coral Gables is a dominant field for property investments, measured by all of the  economic yardsticks by which investment is  guided ordinarily. 		image/tiff						116071650 Bytes	5330	7259	3119435244	RGB	8	600	asc99990000020018001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/644	644	645.jp2	/pamphlets/image/645.jp2

When George E. Merrick set  about to established a new and wonder city in  the only American Tropics, he surrounded  himself at the very beginning with men of  specialized knowledge and training, of rare  judgment and taste in things artistic and  architectural.  The American Tropics constitute a setting  for gems. Coral Gables is a gem befitting its  setting. Sunlight almost every day in the  year; majestic, terrific cloud banks of snowy  white against a sky of deep blue; bright flowers,  towering palm-trees with fronds awhisper in the  Caribbean trade-winds; deep greens of glorious  foliage forming a background for golden fruit—  rippling surf, foam-fringing an azure sea, all  of these furnishing the exquisite in inspiration  to the lover of beauty, with poetry in his soul.  George E. Merrick had the vision of the  dreamer, the soul of the poet, the imagination  of the artist, the driving force of a zealot, the  courage and determination of a warrior—and  he dreamed; wrote the poems upon the virgin  page of the future; etched the picture against  the sky-line of the actual; published his poems  in brick and stone; framed his picture against  Beauty Spot in Coral Gables  a background of reality; drove home the  message of a new, an ideal city, to a nation.  Today, Coral Gables, a city of happy homes  wherein dwell about 10,000 people, is. It is  in keeping with George Merrick's dream of a  city without a scar. He saw to it that it  would be. It is a city in which has been captured the glories of the art and architecture and  beauty of the old world, miraculously transplanted to this new world of America, the  newest frontier of which is Florida, America's  tropic wonderland.  An entrance—a gateway? Let it be the  famed entrance to Granada. A tower? Let  it be the historic Giralda Tower of Seville. A  home? The charm, seclusion, the hospitality,  the color, of old Spain. An hostelry? From  the golden shores of the Mediterranean. An  access to the sea? Then let it be a waterway  from old Venice, with gondolas and gondoliers.  That was the spirit of George E. Merrick, a  spirit that dominated the planning and the  building of Coral Gables.  But with this difference—his city has been  laid out with the consolidated city-planning  experience of all America as a guide and with  their mistakes taken into account. No dingy,  narrow street of the old world; no close-packed  tenement, no evil atmosphere of the dark  ages—but a city of light, of color, of joy, of  learning, of culture, of spirituality, and yet,  withal, of twentieth century American enterprise and progress.  Nothing in the permanent structure of  Coral Gables can be unsightly, inharmonious. 		image/tiff						119448630 Bytes	5470	7279	1427734831	RGB	8	600	asc99990000020019001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/645	645	646.jp2	/pamphlets/image/646.jp2

Not a home in Coral Gables; not a business  structure of any kind, but is passed upon, its  plans designed or approved by a master of his  craft. Even the color of the stucco on the  houses, even the style of the roof, of the window casements—even the color of the awnings  set out to shed the noonday sun, all of these  things must be passed upon by architect and  artist so that there may be no clash against the  general scheme of things.  All of the golden atmosphere of ancient days  has been transplanted and placed in the only  Tropics in America, through the imagination  and applied determination of George E. Merrick. It took courage of a high order to fly in  the face of all American experience in land  development—but George Merrick was not  merely developing land for sale. He was  building a city. And a city of startling architectural, artistic and tropical landscaped  beauty has he built.  Alhambra Plaza  Back in the Everglades, those regions that  savor of mystery and romance and adventure,  there lies an ever-bearing, ever-producing  nursery of tropic trees and shrubs and flowers.  Down on the Florida Keys, famed in song and  pirate story, is a blooming, fragrant garden,  with the palm-trees raising their fronds skyward. Thousands of palms, coconut-trees and  royal palms, in the 'Glades and on the Keys,  forty to fifty feet high—a never-failing nursery  for replenishing and reinforcing the tropic  beauty of Coral Gables.  Here in a tropic garden where the summer  heat is tempered by the tropic trade-winds and  the winter days warmed by the tropic sunshine, where one lives and plays out-of-doors  and breathes deep of the warm salt air of the  Southern seas, George E. Merrick has builded  and builded well. Great parkways full of  virile tropic foliage, the scarlet hibiscus, the  dainty oleander, the golden grapefruit, the  orange, the honeysuckle, the sweet-scented  magnolia—all greet the eye in the fullest  beauty of tropic profusion.  And here it is summer in winter, and you  can play, out-of-doors, the whole year 'round.  Coral Gables is a city of beauty amid a tropic  paradise. 		image/tiff						120322110 Bytes	5510	7279	3003762827	RGB	8	600	asc99990000020021001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/647	647	648.jp2	/pamphlets/image/648.jp2

Gray, meteorologist at the Miami station of the United States  Weather Bureau.]  IAMI is situated on Biscayne Bay,  three and one-half miles from the  Atlantic Ocean, in latitude 25° 48'  North and longitude 80° 12' West. It is  nearly 300 miles farther south than Cairo,  Egypt, the parallel of latitude upon which it is  situated running through the Sahara Desert,  Arabia, and Northern India. It has a modified  tropical marine climate. During the summer  months, it is only slightly affected by continental influences, and the climate is practically the same as that of the Bahamas and  West Indies. In winter, the disturbances and  high pressure areas of middle latitudes move  farther south across the United States, and  some of these affect the weather over extreme  Southern Florida, giving to the winter climate a  variability that is entirely absent in the purely  tropical marine climate of summer. The  vegetation is tropical, the coconut palm, royal  palm, mango, pineapple, banana, and many  other trees and plants of the tropics growing  prolifically.  The highest average monthly temperature  is 82°, in August, and the lowest is 68°, in  January. The average January temperature  is the same as the average June temperature  for Atlantic City, N. J., and it is one degree  higher than the average June temperature  for Los Angeles, Calif. The weather during  the summer months is continuously warm, but  excessively high temperatures do not occur.  The extreme maximum temperature for a  period of 30 years is 96°, while the average  number of days per year with temperatures of  90° or above is five. There is no record of  a heat prostration ever having occurred at  Miami. Freezing temperatures have been  recorded on only six days in a period of 30  years, and the absolute minimum for the period  was 27°.  Sunshine occurs on an average of 359 days  per year. A day without sunshine is such an  unusual occurrence as invariably to cause  comment.  Dense fogs are of rare occurrence, there  being an average of only two per year. The  few fogs that occur are, without exception,  dissipated during the early morning hours.  East and southeast winds prevail, especially  during the summer months, when they are  similar to the trade-wind in constancy. The  average hourly velocity is slightly less than  nine miles per hour.  The absence of extremes of temperature, the  almost unbroken procession of days with sunshine, and the prevailing ocean winds, all combine to give to Miami an exceptionally favorable climate. No more delightful winter  weather can be found outside of the tropics.  From December to April, the weather is conducive to outdoor activities and pleasures,  including surf-bathing in water whose temperature is above 70° 		image/tiff						115274490 Bytes	5250	7319	2258508356	RGB	8	600	asc99990000020024001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/650	650	651.jp2	/pamphlets/image/651.jp2

La primera tienda de Miami fue  fundada por el Sr. William Brickell  en 1870. Mas tarde en 1880 la se-  flora Julia D. Tuttle con su esposo vi-  sito a su padre Ephraim T. Sturtevant  y mas tarde regreso para vivir defi-  nitivamente en Miami.  En 1890 ya habia un pequeno pueblo en lo que entonces se llamaba  Fort Dallas a la orilla del rio Miami  y debido a los esfuerzos de la se-  nora Tuttle con el constructor de fe-  rrocarriles Flagler obtuvo que este  construyera el ferrocarril hasta Miami en Abril 15 de 1896.  En Julio 2'8 del mismo afio ya Miami era una ciudad ya que todos los  habitantes votaron porque se dejara  de utilizar el nombre de Fort Dallas.  Entre los pioneros estaban Joseph  A. Mc Donald que fue luego presi-  dente de la Camara de Comercio de  Miami. El primero fue Everest Se~  well.  En 1920 la poblacion de Miami ha~  bia llegado a 29#471f en 1930 a  110:837 y en 1945 habia llegado a  310,637.  La colonia latinoamericana en Miami pasa ya de 17,000 habitantes to-  mando parte dicha colonia en todos  los actos importantes de la ciudad y  contribuyendo a crear el ambiente  hospitalario que coloca a Miami en  primer lugar como atraccion de los  latinoamericanos que en numero de  cerca de 150,000 arriban todos los ve-  AL SALIR DE LA ADUANA DEL AEROPUERTO DE MIAMI. ..

I  Desde   los   remotos   tiempos   del  descubrimiento de America, las be-  llas playas donde fueron estableci-  das ciudades como esta vivieron al  margen de los turbulentos dias que  marcaron la colonizacion del nuevo  mundo. La primera colonia que se  fundo en la Florida a mediados del  siglo XVI, fue mas tarde abandonada  por los espafioles sin dejar nastro  alguno. Pasaron asi tres siglos y medio sin que los hcmbres se decidie-  ran a levantar una ciudad sobre arenas en una costa de coral. Pero este segundo esfuerzo transformo en  realidad los suefios fabulosos que al-  bergaron en su mente los primeros  colonizadores.  La historia de Miami Beach co-  mienza con un origen humilde, unos  pocos anos antes del inicio de este  siglo. Una hermosa playa nombrada  entonces, Ocean Beach, fue consi-  derada como pueblo en marzo de  1927; y por medio de un increible  desarrollo', es hoy dia una de las  grandes ciudades de los Estados  Unidos y el primer centro turistico  de las Americas.  Originalmente, toda la orilla en el  frente del oceano, extendiendose entre Miami Beach y Palm Beach, una  distancia de mas de 65 millas, perte-  necia a dos hombres, Ellos la habian  conseguido del gobierno con la idea  de producir y vender cocos. En el  ano 1911, cuando esta empresa fue  abandonada, John S. Collins, un rico  hacendado de Nueva Jersey, compro  toda la seccion que es hoy la ciudad de Miami Beach para dedicarse  al cultivo de aguacates y otras frutas  tropicales.  ..;-■_.  «0UtL  Vivira   como   un    rey!  COMPLETAMENTE  DE  AIRE  ACONDICIONADO  Magnified   piscina  y cabana  club  UNA CUADRA ENTERA  DE OCEANO  Entre las calles 31 y 32,  Miami Beach  Un corto tiempo despues que Collins obtuvo estas tierras, el futuro de  Miami Beach estaba destinado a co-  menzar un cambio fantastico y le-  gendario. Collins habia agotado sus  recursos en un intento por edificar  un puente de madera desde Miami  a Miami Beach, a traves del cual el  pudiera   transportar   sus   productos.  Carl G. Fisher, un multimillonario de  Indianapolis, Indiana, se intereso en  el proyecto y presto el dinero a Collins para terminar el puente. En re-  compensa, Collins cedio a Fisher va-  rios cientos de acres de tierra como  bonificacion por el prestamo.  Fisher comenzo a rellenar y lim-  piar terrenos trazando y deslindando  calles y parques, y muy pronto la  agricultura fue olvidada comenzando  asi el liesa^rpllo  de Miami  Beach.

Los innumera-  bles atractivos de esta ciudad, 11a-  mada la mas bella del sur de la Florida, hacen de este sitio de veraneo  un centro linico en este hemisferio.  El clima templado de Miami Beach  cuyo promedio es de 81? F., en ve-  rano y 68? en invierno, hace las de-  licias de los visitantes y residentes  que pasan la mayor parte del tiem-  po al aire libre.

Por eso es famoso  en todo el mundo el clima sub-tropical de Miami Beach.  Carreras de caballos, pesca, natacion, golf, tennis en fin todos los deportes imaginables se practican a dia.  rio en Miami Beach. Los paseos en  botes   son  tambien  muy  populares  pudiendo alquilarse botes o embar-  caciones excursionistas en los dis-  tintos muelles de la ciudad.

Not infrequently I am asked what contribu-  -^ tions Florida has made to me. Pleasure, rest and recreation are real but not necessarily  tangible assets, but in addition to these things, I feel that Florida has given me at least  five years of additional life. Perhaps I can stretch it out to six or seven years, but of five  years I am reasonably certain. I am not overfond of pneumonia so common in the north  Florida is a great state for the old folks when they haven't the vitality they once had  This has been discovered by a great many people, and to me it affords assurance that Florida never will be forgotten. There are a great many more men and women living up  north who have only to get in the sunshine for one winter to become real enthusiasts for  the state, as well as annual visitors."—Thomas A. Edison.  "The same factors which  make Miami the perfect winter resort also make it the  ideal place for a permanent  home. It is well known that  many residents came here as  visitors, and were so impressed with what they found  that they decided to remain."  —Ralph K.

It  has been built by the spirit of conquest in its citizens. It had location  and climate to build on, but what  really built it were the odds against  its men and women, who, in overcoming obstacles did that which city  builders have done time out of  mind, faced a challenge, met it in  a spirit of conquest, and won."—  Victor Murdock, in the Wichita  (Kan.) Eagle.  w  CITY HALL AND COURTHOUSE  MIAMFS SKYLINE  Miami—A Modern Eden  ONLY one night out by train from the population centers of the United States will bring you into Miami,  out of the grip of northern snow and ice into the fairyland which drew Ponce de Leon on his quest of the Fountain  of Youth. The trip from New York is thirty-two hours, or  thirty-six hours from Chicago.  But with the magical changes the years have wrought, one  factor has remained just as it was on that memorable day when  the adventuresome Spaniard dropped anchor in an azure sea  and hailed the new palm-strewn land which has since proved  itself a marvelous place for extending the life span. The sun  shone brilliantly that day as it does each day in these modern  times. And, though science had not then made so much progress, the old Spaniards knew that sun meant health and vigor,  rejuvenated tissues and a longer life. This fact, of course, is  considerably more stressed today.  Today, of course, a metropolitan city has risen over coral  slopes and sun-kissed beaches. In modern Miami is to be  found a veritable tropical garden of Eden.  Miami Accessible  ; Accessibility, perhaps more than any individual factor,  ha!s figured in Miami's rapid growth. Though distinctly different from every other American city, it is close enough  to the congested metropolitan cities to be considered adjacent.  It is far removed only in the sense that it is far from the  commonplace order of American municipalities. Its tropical  dress, the scent of orange blossoms, its barbaric colors, suggest  the romantic lands of the far East rather than modern  America. So accessibility has drawn great hordes to Miami  by train, boat, motor car and airplane. 		image/tiff						79276605 Bytes	4809	5495	2670620483	RGB	8	600	asc99990000210005001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/702	702	703.jp2	/pamphlets/image/703.jp2

Now I spend my  summers looking forward to the  time I can go south to spend the  winter in Miami, which becomes  more attractive and appealing every  time I come here."—Hosea Mann,  banking commissioner of Vermont,  and speaker of the Vermont house  of representatives.  ^ #§S&i v^f  METROPOLITAN MIAMI  The Highway of Palms  STRAIGHT down the sun-bathed East Coast of Florida,  the Highway of Palms takes one through the rich orange  belt and its groves of golden fruit; along the historic  Indian River, bordered by tall palms, bending under the  weight of great clusters of coconuts, and over a velvet-smooth  surface with the gently heaving bosom of the Atlantic ocean  ever in view.  Heading southward from Jacksonville you feel the compelling influence of the tropics, the romance of St. Augustine,  America's oldest settlement, slumbering under great, spreading live-oaks and cypress trees, as eternal as the city over  which they stand watch.  With every mile you may see the subtle changes in nature s  paintings. Southward you move into Daytona, home of the  sable palm and thence to Ormond, famous for the estate or  John D. Rockefeller. . ,  The Highway of Palms runs as a shiny, new ribbon ot road  into Miami. The Federal Highway, another new hard-surface  road, is but a mile inland from the sea.  Fairyland's Promenade  Both will take you to the outer edge of Miami and into the  most magnificent thoroughfare in America—Biscayne Boulevard. Here is the promenade of fairyland—throbbing heart-  center of Miami in America's only tropics. This is a fitting climax to the journey over the Highway of Palms, like the pot or  gold at the rainbow's end. For the first time you glimpse the  entire gamut of the palm family, the coconut palm, the royal  palm the travelers' palm, the Washingtonian palm, the palmetto  palm, apron palm, and other varieties spreading in prodigious  quantity over the curbs and parkways of Biscayne Boulevard.  „,    &';.,   -     •&lt;*  *'% *'*    v-;      „  OUT FOR A TAN 		image/tiff						79565145 Bytes	4809	5515	2512985634	RGB	8	600	asc99990000210006001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/703	703	704.jp2	/pamphlets/image/704.jp2

AT THE BAND CONCERT  A Motorist's Paradise  MORE than 1,000 miles  of smooth rock-based,  hard-surfaced roads  radiate from Miami along  ocean beach, through tropic  splendors and far out into the  Everglades as proof of Miami's  claim to be the motorist's  Mecca. Boulevards, palm  fringed and parked with hibiscus, oleander, crotons, bougain-  villea, banana plants, bamboo,  pandanus, begonia, and other  growing things that are seen  nowhere else in the United  States present a riot of color  and interest for the motorist.

Miami Rich in Tradition  Miami is rich in tradition  and historic interest. Its beginning dates back to the days  of Columbus and De Soto.  Over that long period of 400  years it built up a stalwart  background which figured in  its meteoric development in the  last two decades.  In 1910 it numbered little  more than 500 citizens in its  permanent population, traded  indifferently over general store  counters and passed lazy days  in restful quiet.  Its following years, however,  saw a growth which caught  the imagination of America.  Miami today is as modern as  science of building and American energy can make it. It is  a complete city, ready for the  industry which is finding it a  solution    to    many    problems,  "The important point is that the  cost of living in Miami today is to  the man of average means, the one  who wants to go to a warm climate  in winter and not overspend himself doing it, exceedingly and astonishingly attractive." — James  Hay, Jr., in the Asheville Citizen.  %  -  ..ftSft^.-ftftftW  mmmMm&:?-mm}.  ^^mi^^^^m^^^t^^^l-??.-    - ■■^^^9?kW^?i^?^K?---::^.  ■ftftft:.ftftft-iftHftftS::,■ w::■■-■  "■-.-"■■.':■&gt;-'-'■•'"' ■ -• ,.--"-■"..' -   -ftftftftXa-wVi-ftftft.;■■: ftftftftft::,:■".'■■■:■&lt; - ■ .,-.,.■. .■ -:  '■■?m????^^???^^^^^ .   ■?:&gt;m^?Bm^mmx^'?:yx?^  m^m+mm^m,?::?:., -     -.'' y - -    t v::y^.%^^s%^?^^^%\ ^-:- v-?,  f,;ftft:*;&gt;:,;.-, i-V'-ft; ;■■-,.:*:;,■&gt; :i;;ft:';:: V;' .;;■ &gt;:-;;.".: ■ -;: --:'.: ":':":-&gt; "* :■;..;;..-    tV^M$^^^:&^A^y^-:^  mmm^mmmm-.: ? ■- ■ i :-mmmmmmMi  ^?Wk(??&^:?  ^3sssi^-  ^^tS|&gt;  ■:#:#:3';}''Sft;.;M;  mmmmm^  wmMwmm?..,,...  ?'■':?.???r?'-x■?;'&lt;&gt;'??'ft"""-'-.'.."".' ?:?.??::*:' ,  mmmmmm?m.  - ■"■"f"-?;r"-'-■' :.ft:-&gt; "ft •:■  ■^-:h:?-.?xX:^.?'-X?'"??'-'?:l  '*.

Vital factors of nature have  dealt kindly with Miami. There  is an open-house, out-of-doors  atmosphere and a clean breeze  off the sea and there is a joy  in living where health abounds  the year round in the curative  sun rays.  There are twelve months in  the year when fresh vegetables  and golden ripe tropical fruits  are harvested. More and more  the big market centers of the  United States are coming to be  dependent upon south Florida  for winter produce; farming in  this advantageous region is the  keynote of the present trend.  There is every elemental factor here necessary to agriculture. The muck soil is black  and rich and highly productive.  Growing things need sunlight  and Miami has this 360 days  every year.  The rainfall works out to the  best possible advantage of the  farmer and the winter visitor.  Miami has the typical tropical  rainfall, quick, generous, brief,  and heavy showers rarely blan^  ket the entire city at one time. 		image/tiff						79565145 Bytes	4809	5515	1831857538	RGB	8	600	asc99990000210008001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/705	705	706.jp2	/pamphlets/image/706.jp2

One feels it is good to be alive and in  Miami where a gently tempered climate seems especially  designed to induce a tonic exhilaration during the winter  months, and where the ills and chills attendant on the season  are foreign factors.  This is primarily because Miami has the lowest maximum  temperature and the highest minimum temperature of any  city in the United States. It is completely without either extreme of weather. The mean average of the city is 74.4 degrees (six winter months, 70.9 degrees; six summer months  79.3 degrees). There has never been a heat prostration in  Miami.  In twenty-eight years,. according to the official record of  the United States meteorological station, the thermometer has  reached 90 degrees on an average of but five times yearly. In  that same period freezing temperatures were recorded but  seven times and then of less than two hours duration. Fog is a  negligible factor, averaging about three hours during the entire twelve months, of the year.  A Comparison With Famous Climes  ; A comparison of Miami's climate with that of the cele-  tjrated resort places of the world reveals the fact that Miami  if less subject to extremes than the Riviera, the Mediterranean,  cjr Pacific Coast cities. Those disconcerting changes from heat  to cold and back again are unknown in Miami where the  average range during the winter months is only 12.4 degrees  and less than that in the summer. The following table of  comparison of the world's choicest climes is compiled from  official data. 		image/tiff						76917945 Bytes	4649	5515	3532427666	RGB	8	600	asc99990000210009001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/706	706	707.jp2	/pamphlets/image/707.jp2

It is nearly 300 miles farther south  than Cairo, Egypt, the parallel of latitude upon which it is  situated running through the Sahara Desert, Arabia, etnd  northern India. It has a modified tropical marine climate.  The vegetation is tropical, the coconut palm, royal palm,  mango, pineapple, banana, and many other trees and plants  of the tropics growing prolifically.  "The highest average monthly temperature is 82°, in  August, and the lowest is 68°, in January. The average January temperature is the same as the average June temperature  for Los Angeles, Calif.

There are ample accommodations not only for children of  all year-round residents but  also for those of Miami's guests  who spend all or a part of the  season here. The buildings are  modern in every respect. A  number of new structures have  just been completed.

It had a thousand stu-  dents its opening year. The  University of Miami offers  courses in the College of Liberal  Arts leading to the Bachelor of  Arts and Bachelor of Science  degrees, courses in engineering,  law, business administration,  education, music and art. It  offers courses for adults both in  the day and evening classes, together with special lectures and  concerts. Many of these latter  are given at various locations in  the Miami district as well as at  the University building in Coral  Gables. The concerts present  an opportunity to the general  public as well as to students to  hear outstanding vocalists and  instrumentalists. The building  is about three miles from the  center of Miami.

It is not enough to say that  more than 200,000 visitors attended these two meetings. But  both groups came to Miami in  summer time—out of season, so  to speak — and found the climate delightful.  Convention delegates voiced  their approval and delight in  the resolution, drafted by  Henry C. Warner, of Dixon,  111., district deputy of the northwest district of Illinois, and presented by Dr. C. D.

Thousands of Reasonable Apartments  The great variety of Apartment Houses in Miami and their  varied location on the bay, river or inland gives the visitor a  chance to express his own desire in selecting his apartment.  Apartment houses range from 1 to 15 room suites, and at as  wide a variety of prices as there are variety of locations and  siies to choose from. Practically all the apartments available  are so completely furnished that about all the visitor has to  bring along, as it has been so aptly put, is a toothbrush.

And  there are others where baseball  and tennis matches are played  daily, within easy access of  downtown  Miami. 		image/tiff						79521585 Bytes	4789	5535	2872881585	RGB	8	600	asc99990000210016001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/713	713	714.jp2	/pamphlets/image/714.jp2

JOHNNY FARRELL's FANS  Unsurpassed Aviation Facilities  THE plane enthusiast of the population centers of the  north is only a few hours removed from Miami by the  sunlight route down the Eastern Seaboard. Miami is  equipped with the most modern and extensive aviation facilities, including three landing fields, the last of which is just  being completed, and a seaplane base, comparable in size to  the dockage space in New Yark.  Headquarters for the famous Curtiss Aviation School,  Miami has ample hangar space and repair facilities for every  type of plane. The Pan-American Airways, Inc., operating  between Miami and Panama, by way of Havana, is just completing its airport at an expenditure of $65,000, while the  Hialeah Field and the Municipal Airport are both in general  use day and night.  The amateur flyer will find sufficient opportunity for pleasant flights to such accessible and interesting places as Bimini,  Nassau and Havana, all within three hours flight from Miami.  When the Pan-American Airways field is completed aerial  passengers to Miami will alight at the finest air passenger  station in the United States. Miami also has the first international air ticket station in the country. One of the special  features is that there are customs arrangements whereby passengers going to or from Havana are not detained longer than  one minute and a half for inspection of luggage.  Miami is an easy city for the aerial tourists to reach because it is the southern terminus of the New York-Atlanta-  Miami airmail route. There are landing fields at frequent and  convenient locations from New York to Miami. The route is  marked all the way down. For visitors coming from the west  there is the air route running from Chicago to Atlanta and  then to Miami.

Lazy Days on An Azure Sea  Any coast resort may offer  boating and sailing advantages  but rarely does one find the  combination of features and facilities to be had in Miami.  A sea as blue as the richest  sapphire beckons you to spend  a sunny afternoon in the Gulf  Stream or you may cruise on  the brilliant rainbow hued  waters of Bay Biscayne where  "Miami's hotels are splendid and  there is no question but that travel  will catch up with the extensive  hotel facilities provided here."—  Horace Leland Wiggins, president  Pennsylvania Hotel Association,  and managing director Benjamin  Franklin Hotel,  of Philadelphia.  .  m  IN THE LA GORCE OPEN  'mM??^  the lovely tints change with the  tides.  The most luxurious, famous  yachts in America are regular  visitors in Miami and in midwinter when the season is on  and Miami is gay in holiday  dress, Bay Biscayne is alive  with a throng of picturesque  craft. Records show that more  than 60 per cent of the finest  yachts in America seek port in  Miami every season.  Here you find conditions  ideal for sailing or for thrilling  rides in express cruisers or sea  sleds. For the latter craft, Bay  Biscayne is ideal, too, and fa'  mous for its power boat course  over which the speediest craft  in America vie for international  honors each year.  Miami has the distinct advantage of being in close proximity to the strange little  islands of the tropical Atlantic.

This section has the  greatest part of the fruit trees  of the New World.

Miami is peculiarly favored for such plans with  the northern centers but thirty-three short hours away.  A Fertile Agricultural Empire  The great agricultural areas back of Miami have begun to  show the promise they hold for the future. Oranges, grapefruit,  the nutritious avocado, the mango in several varieties, limes  and lemons, bananas, papayas, in fact almost every kind of  tropical fruit are seen golden ripe along the roadsides. Several  crops of green vegetables are grown each season. And in that  back country are dairy herds that prosper so well in Miami's  equable temperatures without the usual drain of rigorous  winters on the stock. There are also to be had in "dead of  winter" strawberries, blackberries and other delicacies. With  drainage of the Everglades a certainty through state-controlled  operations, there are now being opened to agriculture additional vast stretches of fertile lands.  On south from Miami through the great citrus fruit and  agricultural belt of the Redlands to the southern tip of continental Florida are thousands of acres now producing some of  the world's finest citrus fruits, avocados, mangoes and a hundred rare tropical fruits and vegetables. One tomato farm at  Goulds comprises 5,000 acres, the largest unit in the world.

Flash of colorful jockey silks  —thundering of hoofs beating  in  a  close  finish roar  of thousands of voices, a clubhouse shot with color, the mov.  ing spectacle of fashion on parade—this is the portrait of the  Miami Jockey Club which resumes winter racing under  summer skies at its million-  dollar plant here this season.  One of the most beautiful  racing plants in America, the  Jockey Club is the focal point  for mid-winter society and the  haunt of the lover of the sport  of Kings. Here in mid-winter  you will find the best racing  blood of American stables, a  favorite meeting for owners  and trainers whose horses are  kept in perfect condition for  the spring and summer meetings in northern tracks.  After an idle season the  Jockey Club re-opens January  17 for a meeting of 51 days of  racing. Seven times daily the  horses will go to the post.  Although comparatively  young, racing history has been  made at this famous track, the  only place in America where  "When all is said, Miami remains  the most wonderful winter spot in  the world."—Major Frederick D.  Owsley, retired, Chicago.  "I have never in my life seen a  more beautiful sight than your Biscayne Bay."—Mrs. Frank B. Kellogg, wife of Secretary of State.  ■pi  %£0f:  DOWN THE STRETCH  mid-winter racing is an actuality. In season more than 800  horses are quartered at this  plant, although the club has  ample space for more than a  thousand horses.  The track proper, its grandstand, club house, stables and  broad terraces, is an ensemble  of beautiful landscaping, where  native vegetation, palm trees  and tropical flowers give it a  distinctive touch, unlike the  other famous horse tracks of  America. The city maintains an  efficient bus service from Miami  to the Jockey Club.  Archery Golf  Like golf, archery is one of  the famous mid-winter sports  of Miami and archery-golf is  the game whose star is just now  in the ascendancy.

Special efforts are made to  provide programs which will interest and be helpful to the  stranger as well as to those who are regular attendants. Cordial invitations are given to visitors to join in the various activities and social life of these churches.  Miami churches have been fortunate in gathering to their  pulpits an exceptionally high type of spiritual leadership.  Church-goers among the visitors may expect to hear discourses  on vital problems of human life and relationship. As the result of constant effort through the years, church music in  Miami has been built to a high standard—a standard which  compares favorably with that of the largest cities of the  country.  During the winter season Miami attracts the leaders of the  religious world, just as it does the leaders in every line of  human endeavor, and in its churches are annually heard many  of the most eminent divines of America.  Each winter there are conducted in the larger churches of  Miami several important religious conferences, taking up surveys of various fields of church activity such as missions,  church extension, modern trends of theology, Sunday school  work, week-day church activities, etc. These conferences are  addressed by prominent church leaders in the various fields,  and are open to the public.

It was on this course a year  ago that Gar Wood, well  known Detroit and Miami boat  designer, broke his own world's  record with his Miss America  V. Every year sees such exhibitors pacing as Carl G. Fisher,  of Miami Beach and Indianapolis; Mrs. W. J. Connors, of  Buffalo; Mrs. Delphine Dodge  Cromwell, of Detroit, and  many others as well known.  Maj. H. O. D. Segrave, noted  London sportsman, will represent Great Britain in this year's  regatta.  The regatta is staged every  year at the height of the midwinter season. There are class  races for boats of every sue  and description from the outboard motor, hopping in and  out of the water, to the big  power craft of the Miss America type which averages 80  miles an hour.  "To the individual seeking quietude  of mind Miami is almost divine."—  Frederick D. Owen, retired engineer and architect of the department  of public buildings and public  parks, Washington, D.

A land of summer is Florida, a land of flowers and sunshine,  and the perfection of its beauty is first seen at Saint Augustine, the ancient, beautiful city,  filled with famous show places and rich with relics of past English and Spanish rule.  There is every facility for full enjoyment of the healthful out-of-door life in Saint  Augustine, the beautiful bay for sailing and fishing, with one of the finest beaches in  the country near; splendid roads and bridle paths make driving and riding a delight. One of the most picturesque places is the Old City Gateway, now standing  open. There is the famous old cathedral, the oldest place of worship in America,  while at Old Fort Marion one may see remnants of the ancient fortifications which  once defended the town. Now a sea wall runs around the fort and along the entire  bay front of the city to Saint Francis' Barracks, once a Franciscan Monastery.  The golf season at Saint Augustine is longer than at any other of the winter  resorts and the tennis courts are among the best in the country.  Palatial is the only word which even approaches a description of the two great  hotels of Saint Augustine, the Ponce de Leon, the Alcazar and Annex. All are  gorgeous, but not over-elaborate; brilliant, but not glaring; massive, but not ornate.  They are a triumph of Spanish Moresque architecture, while sparkling fountains  and a wealth of tropical foliage make the hotel gardens marvels of Southern beauty. 		image/tiff						78689058 Bytes	5109	5134	1086168229	RGB	8	600	asc99990000130005001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/738	738	739.jp2	/pamphlets/image/739.jp2

At Ormond the Halifax River runs parallel with the Atlantic, and the Hotel Ormond, directly on the river, is the center  from which the gayety of the place radiates from October to May.  Automobile racing is the popular sport at Ormond, even discounting the charms of the superb golf course, for a twenty-mile  track stretches along the beach, and here the auto enthusiasts, professional and amateur, congregate at the opening of the season. It was here that  William K. Vanderbilt broke the worlds record in his famous race along the  Ormond-Daytona track, and the winter tournaments afford the best of sport for participants and spectators. A fine new Automobile Club House has been built at a  picturesque point overlooking the course.  At low tide a splendid stretch of beach is ideal for driving, riding, and cycling,  while the motor boats and the sail-rigged bicycles skim along the ocean s edge like  flying swans.  Miles of palm-fringed boulevards on either side of the Halifax are spanned by  splendid bridges. Sea bathing here is delightful and surf bathing invigorating and safe.  Homelikeness is one of the prevailing characteristics of the Hotel Ormond. The  great rotunda on the main floor* is a sort oij rendezvous for guests at the hotel, while  broad porches and lovely gardens afford every opportunity for healthful out-door life  in this favored land, not as tropical as most of the Florida resorts, with life and  vigor in every breath of the sea-salt air.  Deep-sea fishing is superb, while finny treasures may be pulled from the inland  waters in almost endless variety. 		image/tiff						78060651 Bytes	5109	5093	1928847862	RGB	8	600	asc99990000130009001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/742	742	743.jp2	/pamphlets/image/743.jp2

Conceive a strip of land  broken from the mainland and separated from it by a sheet of  water possessing the* fascination of an inland wood-bordered lake,  while the opposite side is bathed in the grandeur of the open sea.  This, in a word, is the position of the strip of land that was selected  for the site of the magnificent Royal Poinciana and the Breakers.  On the side which looks out upon the Atlantic stands the Breakers  with wide verandas and broad promenades, seemingly devised especially that the  ocean breezes might sweep up and down their vast esplanades and fritter away into  zephyrs around their supporting columns. Half a mile west, directly across the  island, stands the Royal Poinciana, which, as recently enlarged, ranks as the largest  hotel on earth. It faces Lake Worth and the mainland beyond. Connecting these  two twentieth-century taverns is a broad {asphaltum promenade flanked en both  sides by a high screen of the most superbj tropical vegetation and illuminated at  night by myriad electric bulbs.  The climate of Palm Beach makes this fwinter resort a most agreeable place of  residence during the snow-time months, and? that the American Epicures of enjoyment are rapidly so discovering is eloquently attested by the number of wealthy  citizens who have within the past few years built palatial villas in this vicinity.  Warm and soft is the air as on a spring dry in a northern valley, and yet never  devoid of that bracing invigoration which causes the sojourner to be ever ready for  golf, tennis, or surf bathing.  In addition to its perfect climate, its grand hotels, charming landscape and comfortable travel, Palm Beach has attractions galore for young, old, grave, and gay. 		image/tiff						78060651 Bytes	5109	5093	3509317517	RGB	8	600	asc99990000130013001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/746	746	747.jp2	/pamphlets/image/747.jp2

The railroad was partly responsible for this, but even more  was the Hotel Royal Palm, a great, roomy, home-like building surrounded by tropical gardens and commanding a view which no  other place in the tropics can eclipse.  One of the loveliest spots on beautiful Biscayne Bay is the site of the Royal  Palm, overlooking the deep, blue, sparkling water. Sailing is one of the delights at  Miami, while the fishing there is renowned. So clear is the water of the bay that  its garden-like bed may readily be seen, while the graceful, elusive fish may be gazed  at longingly from the boat by the angler who has been too much engrossed with the  water view to stop as yet to bait his hook.  All about Miami are cocoanut groves and pineapple plantations, while the finest  truck gardens of the world afford the tourist an abundance of summer fruit and vegetables even in midwinter.  At the season when golf is an impossibility north of the Mason and Dixon line  the game is enjoyed under ideal conditions at Miami, where the links are through  tropical gardens in sight of the broad detached verandas of the Royal Palm, and all  the privileges of the links are open to guests at the Royal Palm.  Miami is a perfect city in a perfect clime, with broad, well-laid-out streets, handsome public buildings, and a general air of industry and prosperity, which impresses  the visitor, who too often goes South with the old idea of Southern indolence and  apathy firmly fixed in his mind. 		image/tiff						77753631 Bytes	5069	5113	984113075	RGB	8	600	asc99990000130021001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/754	754	755.jp2	/pamphlets/image/755.jp2

It is the principal place on one of the  fairest islands that ever graced this green earth, an island set like  an emerald in the midst of the sea.  Less than 145 miles from Miami, Nassau lies directly across  the Gulf Stream. Swept by ocean breezes, steeped in sunshine, it  is in truth a land of perpetual summer. The houses are built to  suit the tropical climate, with many wide verandas, and broad casements opening to  sea and sun. Latticed porches offer shade during the heated part of the day, for  everyone lives out of doors at Nassau. A wealth of roses, jessamine, oranges,  pineapple and all the fruits and flowers of the tropics flourish there.  Distinctly military is the atmosphere of Nassau, for Government House is the  center of social activity and royal is the hospitality extended to visitors at this  lovely island of the South. As Nassau is the capital of the Bahamas, the Governor  of the islands lives there. The Victoria and the Colonial are the principal hotels of  the town, each of which is noted for its comforts, its hospitality, and for the beauty  of its surroundings.  One of the water excursions from Nassau is to the wonderful Sea Gardens.  Glass-bottomed rowboats permit of a view of the channel bed, covered with coral  of fantastic and exquisite shapes, while fishes of brilliant hue swim in and out  among the coral branches.  The Queen s Staircase is one of the sights of Nassau, a series of steps cut in  the side of an old stone quarry leading up from the street to an eminence on which  Fort Fincastle stands. 		image/tiff						78980751 Bytes	5149	5113	1018720681	RGB	8	600	asc99990000130025001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/758	758	759.jp2	/pamphlets/image/759.jp2

The sail to Key  West is 165 miles from Miami through the Florida Keys. It is the  most southern city in the United States and less than a hundred  miles from Havana.  Travel to Cuba has constantly increased since the United States  took a hand in the struggle of its people for freedom, and lines of  steamships sail for its principal port, Havana, one of the most  picturesque cities of the South.  Entering the harbor, ones first glance takes in the broad sweep of fortifications  which guards the town from foreign invasion, Morro Castle protecting the magnificent  bay. Back of the fortifications may be seen the town, its gay roofs and odd architecture forming a picture at once distinctly foreign and distinctly pleasing.  The city itself is rich in historic possessions. Almost without exception the  buildings, of stone or brick, are covered with stucco and tinted in the rich, exquisite shades that the Moors introduced into their architecture, while American  enterprise has done much for the city, modernizing it in many ways.  One who has penetrated to the Far South by this trip to Cuba and the summer  lands is usually reluctant to turn his face toward the north, but the day comes when  the last good bye must be said to the tropical country he has learned to love so well.  Traveling leisurely northward, a place well worth a short visit is near Jacksonville, Atlantic Beach, where home comforts and hospitality are extended from the  Continental, a summer hotel, one of the best kept and most attractive hostelries in Florida.  Then, after a stop at Atlantic Beach, it i^&gt; farewell to the South until once more  the icy touch of winter sends the tourist bacl$ to the land of June.  *t* 		image/tiff						78980751 Bytes	5149	5113	2254707272	RGB	8	600	asc99990000130029001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/762	762	763.jp2	/pamphlets/image/763.jp2

Almost seventy years have  passed into history since  the "Land of Flowers,"  the "Pascua Florida" of  Ponce de Leon, was joined  to the federation of states;  but much the larger portion of its advance toward its present greatness has come  within the last third of this period. For decades it was still a  great unknown land, pictured in the popular mind as the home  of alligators, mosquitos and malaria. Then a few adventurous  travelers brought tales that shook the common belief, and  eventually tourists came and were captivated.

No  stifling heat, such as  affects the northern  and western cities, is  ever experienced here,  and heat prostrations  are unknown. There  are two good reasons  for the mildness of  the summer temperature: one is the  absence of large land  masses to become heated, for to the west lies the Gulf of  Mexico and to the east the Atlantic Ocean; the other is  the constant sea-breeze that blows in from the east.

Among the tropical fruits the two most promising are the avocado and mango.  The avocado has none of the enticing flavors of confections or  dessert fruit—it is a salad food, of a rich, nutty flavor, and when  served either plain, with salt and pepper, or any of the salad  dressings, it is very highly appreciated. It can be easily digested and assimilated by the most delicately constituted  persons, and the fats and nourishment that it contains are  in the most wholesome forms.  The ease with which the avocado is grown, and the high  prices which this fruit brings, both in local and northern markets, should make it even more profitable than grapefruit.

Not the com-  mon jungle variety  found growing promiscuously in tropical countries, nor the  seedlings of the finer  sorts which degenerate to those wild  types, but the finer  varieties which can be separated in halves and the seed extracted without leaving any fiber in the pulp, which is to be  eaten from the fruit, with a spoon, like a canteloupe. The  mango has all the richness and sweetness a poet could imagine,  or a gourmand desire.

The returns from a full-bearing grapefruit grove run in the neighborhood of $700.00 per acre.  Grapefruit trees should be planted 25 feet apart, or 64 to  the acre; these yield from six to eight boxes to the tree,  although we have single trees here from which forty boxes  have been taken. The right variety of grapefruit, with the  proper care, brings in the neighborhood of $1.75 to $4.00 per  box, and this price very often is paid for fruit on the trees,  leaving the commission-buyer the trouble and expense of  picking, packing and shipping the fruit.  Grapefruit groves begin to pay handsome returns five years  after planting. During this period the trees must be cared  for, so that all of the strength shall go to the actual development of its branches and roots. While the grapefruit grove is  maturing, one can raise pineapples or garden truck between  the trees, and earn upwards of $400.00 per acre, according to  the energy, labor, and expense placed upon such crops.  POULTR Y-R AISING  The raising of poultry is another profitable industry. Eggs  bring an average  price of 40 cts. a  dozen; live chickens, 35 cts. a  pound.

COCOANUT  PALM  THAT WONDERFUL FLORIDA MOON  Last night I gazed beyond fishing-boats nestling near the shore of  Biscayne Bay, and selfishly, greedily drank in the beauty of a transformation  in Nature's realm which beggars description. To the eastward the signal  was given by multitudinous rays of vari-colored lights seeming to shoot into  the blue sky from the ocean depths beyond. The moon peeped over the  island as though making sure that the coast was clear, and gave out a blush  of modesty which radiated in every direction. As the magnificent orb slowly  climbed from the horizon it seemed to race with a fleecy cloud, whose raiment  was bordered in a peculiar black, forming a contrast in colors of crimson,  black and white. The great red light reflected with wondrous power as it  lifted itself just above the bay and, though quite distant, I discerned on the  island each individual tree skirting the shores, the effect being that of a  far-away forest-fire with tongues of flame leaping into the heavens. Across  the bay crept a line of light in all the colors a rainbow might wear, pointing  the path from the ocean to the pretty city nestling at the bay; and through  it all, silence reigned supreme. Without friction this mighty transformation  proceeded until the moon, well up into the ethereal blue, gradually threw  off its colors of red, and moved along as a majestic sentinel of the night.  An owl hooted from a tree near the shore, and the merry laugh of a child  sounded from a vine-covered cottage, as zephyrs from the sea played with  its curly locks.   And that was all.—Lon. A.

Miami Beach, a separate municipality  across Biscayne Bay from the city of Miami,  is directly on the Atlantic Ocean. It is connected with the mainland by three causeways  which have their terminus in the northern,  central and southern sections of the city.  A delightfully attractive suburb of Miami  is Coral Gables, where imposing Spanish entrances and homes with lavish floral adornment convey the atmosphere of "Old Spain."  More than 1,000 miles of smooth rock-  based, hard-surfaced roads radiate along the  ocean beach, through tropic splendors and  far out into the Everglades.  Miami is nearly 300 miles farther south  than Cairo, Egypt. The vegetation is tropical,  the cocoanut palm, royal palm, mango, pineapple, banana, and many other trees and  plants of  the tropics growing prolifically.  Bayfront Park is on the shore of Bay  Biscayne along the southern terminus of Biscayne Boulevard. The gamut of the palm  family, the Cocoanut Palm, the Royal Palm,  the Travelers' Palm, the Washingtonian Palm,  the Palmetto Palm, and Apron Palm is  spread in prodigious quantity over the curbs  and  parkways  of  Biscayne  Boulevard.  Yachting activities start early in the season  and reach their climax when hundreds of  craft gather along the picturesque Flamingo  Regatta Course for the annual Miami Beach  Regatta late in March.  One of Miami's many famous sporting  classics in the Bay Biscayne Regatta, where  noted international power boat racers meet  every year to battle for supremacy over this  renowned course.  About fifty miles south of Miami is Royal  Palm State Park, comprising 4,000 acres of  tropical jungle, preserved in primeval beauty  as a sanctuary for America's only tropical  flora and fauna.  International golf champions, tennis stars,  swimmers, yachtsmen, those who follow the  thrilling dash of racing motor boats, horse racing, boxing under a dome studded with tropical moon and stars, fox hunting to hounds,  horseback riding, baseball, and other amateur  contests—all are at hand.  A sea as blue as the richest sapphire beckons you to spend a sunny afternoon in the  Gulf Stream.  Fishing boats ply every day out to the gulf  stream with amateur Izaak Waltons. There is  nothing tame about battling with the large  denizens of these sub-tropical waters, and in  the excitement of bringing in that elusive,  finny rascal that is trying to get away with a  good hook, line and sinker, minor troubles are  apt to disappear. Imagine the glee of landing  a game sailfish after a thrilling battle, or  catching a bonita or any one of the strange  fish that inhabit the Gulf Stream, about 3j/2  miles off shore.  Through the clear waters of the reef a few  miles south of Miami are mirrored rare beauties of subsea life, amazing forests of giant  coral jungles, of sea-fans and plumes. The  deep purples and vivid reds of their hues  standing out in sharp contrast to the pure  white sand with its patches of green and blue  sea-grass. Through the branches of these coral  trees gracefully swim the fish that defy description, in color and shape, odd and colorful denizens of the watery depths that are as  diverting as flowers.  Motoring here is a delight. A variety of  fascinating tours intrigue the motorist. Three  great causeways to Miami for a drive along  the ocean: across the Everglades on the new  Tamiami Trail through the most fertile agricultural region in the world and the home of  the gay-garbed Seminole Indian: through suburbs where imposing gateways and attractive  homes carry the atmosphere of old Spain:  through Coconut Grove, noted as the site of  many extensive estates: through the Florida  Keys on the famous new Overseas Highway:  or a score of other jaunts equally interesting.  -MADE IN U.S.A.

In 1920, this  "Magic City" boasted of a population less than 43,000, but, spurred by the Great  Florida Boom of late 1925 and '26, it catapulted to more than 127,000 in the city  proper!   Since that time its advance has faltered not once.  This figure does not include the respective populations of Miami Beach, Coral  Gables, Hialeah, Miami Springs, Miami Shores, Opa-Locka, Homestead, North  Miami and Florida City— all of which, together with Miami, go to make up what  is known as the Miami Area. Nor does this figure include those hundreds of thousands of tourists and vacationists who stream into Miami the year 'round, to enjoy  its tropical grandeur and the hospitality of its permanent residents.  The City of Miami is located in Dade County on the east coast of Florida, on  Biscayne Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. It serves as the county seat and is likewise  favored with excellent transportation facilities— on land, in the air, and on the water.  Miami enjoys an average annual temperature of approximately 75° and its soft  ocean breezes and healthful sunshine make possible the indulgence in outdoor sports  I: I  THOMAS R.

Let us delve# for a short while, into the interesting, colorful history of this remarkable city— this "Playground of the World"—  GREATER MIAMI - 9ii JlttttVUf  According to records available, the first white man to see what is now Miami,  was Escalante de Fontenada, a Spanish nobleman, sole survivor of a galleon, wrecked  on the Florida Keys about 1545. Rescued and held in slavery by the Tekesta Indians  for seventeen years, during which time he roamed at will throughout their country,  he made many observations and notes which to this day constitute our only account  of early exploration in Southern Florida.  Sebastian Cabot, England's intrepid explorer, landed near Miami in 1497, and  Albert Cantino, a Portuguese sea captain, skirted the lower East Coast in 1502. It  remained, though, for Juan Ponce de Leon to name this beautiful section of the New  World — "Florida" — when he sighted it near St. Augustine, at daybreak on Easter  Sunday, March 27, 1513. It is interesting to note that Ponce de Leon's chief navigator  was Anton de Alimones, of Lisbon, who had served Christopher Columbus in a like  capacity nearly 22 years earlier.

The Calusa Indian Federation retains an account of his landing about where "the 79th Street Causeway is now located,  but this has never been authenticated by white men.  Historians disagree on the origin of the name "Miami"; however, Fontenada wrote  in 1551, as follows: "At the head of a bay of thousands of islands, I found a huge  lake called 'Mayaimi' by the Calusa Indians. This lake is of such enormous extent  that it drains into the sea on the East, into a river in the West near a great Ocean,  and into a great swamp in the South where there is much tall grass and many more  islands. This great lake also drains into the Rio Mayaimi which empties into a beautiful lagoon I have named 'Laguna del Espiritu Sanctu'" (Lagoon of Heavenly Spirit,  now known as Biscayne Bay.)  In August of 1567, Pedro Menendez de Aviles, a Spanish mercenary, came South  from a point near the present location of Jacksonville and landed at the Indian Village  of Tequesta. This occurred only two years after the founding of St. Augustine, oldest  city in the United States. He erected a small blockhouse, left a garrison of thirty soldiers, a priest or two and sailed away to Spain, where he announced that he had  settled the territory and named it "Mayaimi" after the huge lake to the West. (Both  Fontenada and Menendez thought the Everglades a huge lake.) Little did these men  realize, nor could they have possibly imagined, that three hundred years later, their  discoveries and claims would have become the Playground of the World and the  home of hundreds of thousands of souls!

Page 7																																	asc9999000039	asc99990000390007001		THE MAGIC CITY  Then for 130 years, "Mayaimi" passed through a period of wars, Indian raids and  massacres concerning which very few records were kept. The section grew in lore,  however, through the persistence of the Spaniards, who claimed the existence of  at least six Fountains of Youth and fabulously rich gold deposits, which in later  days materialized in an entirely different form.  Early in 1743, the Jesuits decided to Christianize the Indians, so Governor Gomez  y Horcasitas of Havana sent Fathers Allana and Monaca to Florida. They stopped,  after a stormy voyage up the coast from Key West, at the mouth of Rio Mayaimi,  which they promptly renamed "Rio de los Ratones". They built a Jesuit Mission at the  site of Coconut Grove and named it "San Ignacio". From 1743 to 1753 very little is  known of historic value concerning this territory, particularly the section around  "Bay Biscayne" (named after the Bay of Biscay by the Spanish).  From then on, we trace a steady influx of settlers from Georgia, the Carolinas,  Maryland, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. These were of Spanish, French, German  and English stock. Their numbers were small but they built homes, cleared land and  began to cultivate cotton, cane, grapes, limes and oranges.  In 1759, Ferdinand, King of Spain, made a treaty with the English and when he  died, the crown went to his brother Charles, who immediately launched a war with  England. In 1762, the English finally captured Havana, which they traded back to  Spain for a clear title to Florida. Now, the settlement of the Florida East Coast had  begun in earnest.

Field officers were offered 5,000  acres each, captains 3,000, lieutenants 2,000,-non-commissioned officers and privates  50 acres. Very few took up the offer, but it is amusing to note the name of a  Private Egan who from his original 50 acres appears 15 years later with a deed  tp 4,000 acres on Biscayne Bay, and who later became one of the richest men in  Florida.  In 1810 we find Frank Lewis, Tolly Lewis, Egan and his son James, Rebecca  Egan, Richard Tice, Joseph Delaspine, Archibald Clark and a few others as the principal land holders in the Biscayne Bay region, although no effort had yet been made  to incorporate a town.  Miami as a South Florida metropolis soon began to take form. Settlers came  in from most of the other States. The High Sheriff of New York being the first of  many notables to arrive in the Promised Land of Plenty. Fort Dallas was established  at the mouth of the Miami River during the year 1836.  Then follows a swift succession of events. Hectic days and years for many, but  through all of which the struggling town began to spread out in all directions and  to assume an important place in the agricultural and trading world.  Early families such as the Tuttles, Brickells, Fitzpatricks, Gibsons, Englishs,  Joseph Days, Baileys, Thews, Wheeles, Fords and others had amassed nearly a million acres of the best lands in the vicinity and when, in 1836, the Florida Legislature 	Text	image/tiff						34878087 Bytes	4027	2887	3947461512	RGB	8	600	asc99990000390010001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/825	825	826.jp2	/pamphlets/image/826.jp2

Dade, who, with all but two of  his command, was massacred during the Seminole Indian Wars) we find these  families growing wealthy through the sale of their holdings to purchasers of homesteads.  In 1840, the Seminoles became enraged at apparent injustices meted out by  local officials and raided the settlement, killing several people, burning many  buildings. Miami, at this time, had a population of 440 people and was slowly but  surely growing. However, crop failures due to storm and forays by Indians dismayed  a large number of settlers and by 1850 we find the population had dwindled to 159.  Then, toward the end of the nineteenth century, miracles began to happen.  Northern capitalists, looking for newer and fresher fields, began to hear of this tropical paradise and soon the population had jumped to 890. Good times were ahead  and by 1900, there were 5,000 inhabitants and the first tourist hotels made their  appearance. Miami's growth from then on is responsible for its becoming known  as the "Magic City." 1910 showed 11,933; 1920, 42,753 and in 1932 more than 150,000  and to date there has been no sign of a let-down in the pace of its growth.  When Henry M. Flagler, through an invitation from his friend, Mrs. Julia  Tuttle, decided to visit here, a new era was ushered in for Miami. In 1896, Flagler  brought the Florida East Coast Railway into Miami and built a great Hotel. From  then on the expansion was very rapid, and today Greater Miami in its regal and  tropical splendor is truly the "Playground of the World", a dream city whose destiny  has yet to be fulfilled!

Today it is an amazingly beautiful city of more than  15,000 permanent residents and the winter home of tens of thousands more, including  many of America's best known business and professional men and women.  It is difficult to list all of the interesting places to see because there are so many,  so it is suggested that a systematic tour be made of Alton Road, Pine Tree Drive,  Indian Creek Drive and Collins Ave. north of Dade Blvd. and 23rd St., which will  include most of the beautiful estates, fine hotels and clubs.  OTHER   POINTS   of   INTEREST  • BAKER'S HAULOVER BRIDGE: Ocean Drive, about 7 miles north of Miami Beach.  A popular place for fishing.

Headlights  gleam  on  the  motor  rs that glide over the causeway  and  faintly,  like  echo  of a  cathedral  organ,   sounds   the  distant  boom   of the  surf.  Miami wants shipping. It wants commercial  boats from every port of the Seven Seas. Uncle  Sam has met her at least half way, in a realization  of this ambition. Thus we now have the Government Cut, reaching 3 7-10 miles ,from Ocean and  jetties, to the muncipal docks. It is a straightway  course, officially charted and of sufficient depth—  18.9 feet, at mean low tide, and to be still further  deepened  tt&gt;  accommodate  the  largest vessels.  There is a climatic distinction in being '-'the  most southern city on the mainland of the United  States." and Miami can, of course, lay claim to  this. The sub-tropical zone is the zone of what is  truly perpetual sunshine. Florida is but sixty  miles wide, as a peninsula, due east and west, at  this point. The warmth-bringing Gulf Stream,  passes within 3^ miles of the Miami shore. Excessive heat is not known, and the soft rains generally occur at night. Miami is famed for the luxuriant growth of her royal palms and her fruitful cocoanut palms are everywhere and in fine condition.  The trip down the East Coast of Florida over  the Dixie Highway by motor is the most beautiful  trip in America. And so- on. almost before we know  it. "The Tamiami Trail,'^ will connect Miami with  the  West Coast.  More than 70.000 people represent the fixed winter population. No less than 150.000 tourists visit  Miami in a season. Yet. the city is not congested.  It has 55 miles of paved streets, about 60 miles of  oiled macadam, and 600 miles of superb rock-surfaced, oil coated boulevards, radiating in everv direction. The splendid "Ingraham Highway" leads  you to the Royal Palm State Park, with its deep  jungles, its scientific display of the fauna and bird  life of Florida, and such a kingdom of palms as  is rarely seen anywhere. Each season finds some  famous band as an afternoon and night concert feature of the tropic Royal Palm Park, a great open, cocoanut palm sheltered park, s.wept by breezes* from  Biscayne Bay and located in the very heart of the  city. There are many excellent roads running out  from Miami, and leading to scenic farms, citrus fruit  groves, rivers, lakes, Indian camps, island parks  and resorts, beaches, and to other Florida pleasure  places, notably Palm Beach and intermediate points,  each  remarkable  for some scenic feature.  Miami is the crux of railroad operations, evidenced by the fact that the Florida East Coast  Railway has its shop and yards in the city. It is  the starting place of the wonderful Oversea Railway   route   to-  Key   West.  In Miami there are accommodations of every sort  to fit in with the specific needs, desires and purses  of the visitor. The hotels are commodious in size,  pretentious in appearance and beautiiully designed  inside to provide a maximum comfort, luxury, and  pleasurable  entertainment.  The church-goer will be highly pleased with the  religious atmosphere of Miami. All denominations  are   represented.  Miami Beach has several wonderful golf courses  and nothing quite like them can be found elsewhere in Florida. The game of golf is played in  Miami under most picturesque conditions. The hotels have their own tennis courts and the city has  built several fine tennis playgrounds within easy  walking distance. At Alton Beach a remarkably  polo  are  daily   com  Miai  Bea  bathing   pa-  Ule   bathing  the   jetties  (1 roads that  •asino.  ebildrc  is   located   on  tractive  peninsula.

From November through  March, warm, bright sunshine holds the  mercury to a pleasant average of 70 degrees.  During summer months the cooling, pollen-  free breezes of southeasterly trade winds air  condition the area to an average temperature  of 79 degrees.  But Miami's gentle, sub-tropical climate is  only one of the myriad reasons why Miami  is host to the nation.  The glamorous gateway to two continents,  Miami thrills more and more of the world's  happiest people who find it so convenient to  come from the North or the South, by train,  plane, ship, bus or private automobile.  :«^l:-:f  WHBBRm  ii?   /)  Ssjft-  " ■"..■  ...        ■ i||      -     ,',,;„::,-  .:ft-'   ft  *""      -    ■;:      :-A     ...... . ».     : 		image/tiff						78448578 Bytes	4806	5441	2169598868	RGB	8	600	asc99990000340003001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/913	913	914.jp2	/pamphlets/image/914.jp2

They have  found above-average livelihoods in professional fields ... in retail trades, services and hotels,  transportation and public utilities, wholesale, construction and manufacture. They are building homes  of Mediterranean and contemporary architecture at the rate of 15,000 a year. They have created  dozens of well-planned, strictly zoned suburbs, none of which is more than fifteen minutes by car  from downtown Miami. They worship in more than two hundred fifty churches of all   denominations.  They have the advantages of 23 modern hospitals, well-trained and equipped police and fire  organizations, and an efficient public transportation system. Their school system is rated second to  none. Thirteen thousand students attend the University of Miami — its modern campus one of  the most striking in the world; here also is Barry College. This is the solid foundation upon which  Miamians are building their lives . . . and the lives of their children. 		image/tiff						78173808 Bytes	4776	5456	1058977160	RGB	8	600	asc99990000340019001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/929	929	930.jp2	/pamphlets/image/930.jp2

They rest  and entertain on the porches, loggias and lawns of their pastel-tinted homes. They are fond  of outdoor cooking — most backyards contain picnic facilities for outdoor dining. They  spend a lot of time in the sunshine . . . tinkering with their boats . . . gardening . . .  watching their youngsters at play.  On weekends, Miamians throng to the numerous public parks throughout the area,  availing themselves of the many recreational facilities offered — beautiful, spacious beaches  or pools, cabanas, dressing rooms, refreshment stands, outdoor grills and picnic tables.  But it was not just the leisure-paced existence of tropic life that brought them to Miami.  They recognize South Florida as a tropical frontier — the first and last within the continental  limits of the United States. They rightly regard Miami as the capital of this great area whose  potential in agriculture, manufacturing, commerce and industry has barely been tapped.  It is this faith of Miamians in the unlimited future of their city which makes Miami the  youngest, fastest growing metropolitan area in the world — attracting new residents at the  rate of 45,000 a year.  i  ^^^^^i^^^^^m  AAlAlAAlIlliil  $^m^mm&&^0B*   " '   ".:      .:'.:■■.''

To  locate an address exactly, consult a larger  map showing all streets.  S.E.  GENERAL STREET AND NUMBERING PLAN  Miami is roughly divided into four sections  by Flagler Street and Miami Avenue—(See  diagram and map).  Northwest is north of Flagler Street and  west of Miami Avenue. Northeast is north of  Flagler and east of Miami Avenue. Southwest  is south of Flagler and west of Miami Avenue.  Southeast is south of Flagler and east of  Miami Avenue.  "NUMBERED" THOROUGHFARES  Most of Miami's thoroughfares are designated  by numbers prefixed by "NW", "NE", "SW"  or "SE".  Streets, Terraces, and Lanes run east-west,  parallel to Flagler Street; Avenues, Courts  and Places are north-south, parallel to Miami  Avenue. Thus NW First Street begins at  North Miami Avenue and is the first east-  west street north of Flagler Street.  Address numbers on "number" thoroughfares begin at Flagler Street and at Miami  Avenue, jumping each block to the next 100,  with even numbers on south and west sides,  odd on north and east sides. Thus 13 NW  First Street is in the first block west of North  Miami Avenue, north side of the street.  "NAME" THOROUGHFARES  The majority of the thoroughfares with names  (instead of numbers) are located in the southern part of the city. They are not shown on  this map because of space limitations.

A glance at that list will suffice to convince you that  it must be a work of merit.  THE WORLD'S MIAMI  Confidence in Miami is the prevailing sentiment here today.  It is scarcely less general than the enthusiasm over Miami as a  home city.  Yet, there is a justifiable uncertainty in the minds of a great  many people as to what may be expected of Miami over the next  few years. Some, of course, say that Miami will never have in-  dustry, others say that climate is Miami's only real asset, still others  declare themselves as doubtful regarding a great agricultural development here.  There has been no source of information available to those who  would learn of Miami's possibilities. Here and there of course, one  heard facts and figures. Government publications set forth many  technical points. An address by an expert gave further information. But nowhere was there a book or booklet, for sale or for  free distribution, that really set forth the high spots of Miami's  possibilities from the various angles. There was no means, except  by endless reading and study (much of it duplication) that one  could find the answer to the great uncertainties in people's minds  regarding Miami.  Prominent Citizens Commend and Endorse "The World's Miami," Including  RUTH BRYAN OWEN, Regent, University of Miami.  T.  J.   PANCOAST,   President  Miami  Beach Chamber of Commerce.

The poor things  had come in through  the open window.  When the windows  were closed they found  themselves prisoners.  Unable to see the  transparent obstacles, they had hurled themselves against the glass  panes on all sides, east, north, south and west until they fell to  the floor exhausted, and died. But, I noticed among the bees, a  great drone, much stronger than the bees, who was very much  alive and was dashing himself against the panes with all his might,  like the great beast he was. "Ah, my fine friend," said I, "it  would have been an evil day for you had I not come to the rescue.  You would have been done for, my fine fellow, before nightfall.  Like the Emperor Titus, I shall mark the day by a good deed and  save the insect's life."

I then tried to capture it by throwing a  napkin on it. When the drone saw that I wished to capture it,  it lost its head completely; it bounded furiously against the glass  panes as though it would smash them, took a fresh start and dashed  itself again and again against the glass.  After trying very hard, I brought it down and, in seising it  with the napkin, I involuntarily hurt it. Oh, how it tried to avenge  itself! It darted out its sting; its little nervous body, contracted  by my fingers, strained itself with all its strength in an attempt  to sting me. But I ignored its protestations, and, stretching my  hand out the window, opened the napkin. For a moment the  drone seemed stunned, astonished; then it calmly took flight out  into the infinite.  Well, you see how I saved the drone. I was its Providence.  But (and here is the moral of my story) do we not, stupid drones  that we are, conduct ourselves in the same manner toward the  Providence of God? We have our petty and absurd projects, our  small and narrow views; our rash designs, whose accomplishment  is either impossible or injurious to ourselves. Seeing no farther  than our noses, and with our eyes fixed on our immediate aim,  we plunge ahead in our blind infatuation like madmen. We would  succeed, we would triumph; that is to say, we would break our  heads against an invisible obstacle.—Victor Hugo.

So the three financiers proceeded to Florida, presented themselves before Flagler, and began warily to watch for a chance to  knock him down and truss him up, preparatory to getting him  safely away while he still had enough money left to pay his coal  bills.  While they were sparring for an opening, Flagler seized the  opportunity to express a few well-chosen views on Florida, its  climate, its resources, its natural advantages, its vegetation, its effect  on the heart, lungs, liver, sciatic nerve and general disposition, and  its probable future as a stimulant to the bank account.  By the time the oration was completed the financiers had silently  relinquished their job of bringing Flagler back North, and had  unanimously agreed to act as a committee of three to return to  Wall Street and raise $25,000,000.00 to enable Flagler to continue  his money-squandering program in the manner to which he had  become accustomed. *  What an extraordinary insect that Victor Hugo "drone" would  have been to have recognised its energetic captor as a Savior.

I have read much and listened to considerable of the history  and the economic development of Southeastern Florida. All of it I  have found of intense interest; some of it I have understood; a part  still remains a pussle to me; but, of this I am very sure, that we  are challenged here today by the existence of latent forces of  Providence so infinitely more vast, more powerful and more accessible than could possibly have been within the vision of Flagler as  to be beyond comparison. His railroad leads now through the very  heart of Miami but in 1896 it was but a wilderness of sand-spur  and saw-grass, scrub-palm and palmetto, with here and there a  mosquito infested swamp or a lean pine, stretching itself, it must  have seemed to the casual observer, to its very limit in search of  food and a chance to live.  Yet, standing there in that wilderness, Flagler envisioned a  future for that territory—a growth in population—an economic development—that justified the extension of his railroad through it—  that promised splendid returns on the investment in its construction.  Furthermore, he used his own money and not funds obtained by  promotion.  If a mortal man could see down through the years from that  desolate beginning, then, with the marvelous heritage that is ours  today, I am indeed forced to the conclusion that we have the obligation to pause and earnestly study, in the hope that we might  more nearly approach a full understanding of those forces of Providence so vastly more extensive than when Flagler sought to harness  them. We must seek to discover their greatest use. We must  attempt to really recognise our Providence.  Flagler, with a sound project and a broad view, counting on  the never failing elements of time and human progress, kept his  eyes fixed on a great future and plunged onward to a splendid  success in his undertaking, despite the jeers of those who proclaimed his "a rash design11. They sought to convince him that  his dream was a certain failure and that he would be far better  off, if he dropped the millions already invested rather than send  more millions after those already lost. But, he would not be  turned aside.  It is a romance of leadership and vision but also of sturdy, vigorous, pioneer manpower at its best and it will fascinate and thrill  you.  I  *  Chapter I  A ROMANCE OF PROGRESS  SWo  ^Z&gt;^''^-"--'J. %^: ^'"X'^t ip%  The   Great   Wall   of   China  'OT even the Great Wall  of China could have  more effectually separated Florida from Northern initiative  and capital than did the pall  of despondency, backwardness,  poverty and slowness of development that characterised  the states of the Central South  following the Civil War.  It is an historical fact that  millions of the most aggressive  and ambitious of the young  Southerners left their native land between 1860 and 1900 for the  North, the West or the Southwest. The South's manpower, so  vital a necessity in reconstruction days was thus seriously crippled.  The destruction in these states by the Union armies of invasion;  the disturbance to social and economic conditions caused by freeing  the slaves; the disturbance to industry and commerce resulting  from the War and the Union Naval Blockade; these are but a few  of the factors that were holding back the South to the very dawn  of the present century. Poverty ruled the territory. Poverty  prevented an adequate school system. Poverty prevented the extensive building of highways. Poverty prevented the extension of  railroads and the development and utilisation of the tremendous  natural resources within easy reach.  And, beyond that region—away from progress and prosperity—  was Florida, an empire in itself, a wilderness of wildernesses. Only  manpower can develop—but the manpower was moving north.  And thus, South Florida, the only sub-tropical area in our country,  surrounded by beautiful waters and fighting fish, awaited the turn 		image/tiff						119912130 Bytes	7274	5495	2567843217	RGB	8	600	asc99990000050009001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/944	944	945.jp2	/pamphlets/image/945.jp2

In 1890 just to reach South Florida was a task to test  your resourcefulness and determination, but to visit Miami in that  year—well, there just was no Miami.  Canada separated the Klondike from Seattle but it is doubtful  if even another nation could be a more effectual barrier than was  the backward South in separating South Florida from the North,  and as for distances, the latter is the greater of the two.  Between Cincinnati and Cleveland is the full length of the  State of Ohio, yet, in 1890 an even greater distance separated the  nearest railroad from the site of the present City of Miami.  Nor were distance and lack of transportation facilities the only  elements against which the pioneer developer of South Florida had  to battle.    There follows the story of a grand old Floridian.  "The fact that each year Miami was scourged with swarms of  mosquitoes was perhaps one of the early stumbling blocks in building up Miami and Dade County. The fact is that in the early  days here the mosquito was almost unbearable. It took real courage  to settle here at that time, yet the people on the whole were willing  to undergo much discomfiture in order to stay here. In July, 1897  an excursion was run from Jacksonville to Miami. A large number  of people came here on the  excursion which arrived late on  a  c  THE    WORLD'S    MIAMI  Saturday night. It so happened that it was the writer's turn to  preach that night in the Presbyterian tent at the corner of Avenue  D and Fourteenth Street. When I reached the tent every seat  was occupied and there were many standing around the door who  could not gain admittance. The mosquitoes were swarming in  untold numbers about the congregation. I felt that there would  be little use to preach to a congregation that was being bitten to  a point almost unbearable—I proposed to the congregation that  we sing "Praise God From Whom All Blessings Flow," pronounce  the benediction and adjourn the service. The people said "Where  shall we go?" There were no houses at that time, and they said  "Go ahead," which I did. Never in my life have I been so tortured and the people were tortured likewise. The Miami Hotel  was partially built; the doors and windows were not placed but  the beds were in each room and every room was occupied. After  the service in the tent closed, which was short, the congregation  started out to secure mosquito nets if possible. The merchants  opened their stores and the crowd made a rush for them. In, less  than an hour every mosquito bar in the city was sold and hundreds  of people were seen with their protection wrapped about them." *  Yet, so alluring during the winter seasons were Miami and  South Florida to the sportsman, the adventurer and the chance  visitor, and so enthusiastically did they recount to their friends  back north the wonders and untouched possibilities here that from  the close of the War to 1910, the population of South Florida  increased at the rate of over 2200%. From 12,000 in 1860, South  Florida grew to 256,000 in 1910.  * Rev. E. V.

Tropical shrubbery, stately royal palms, beautiful  waters flowing languidly between banks invisible behind overhanging trees and bushes, fish leaping from the waters, birds in the air  and for six months of the year as near absolute perfection in climate  as one spot can possibly have—all these, and more, for as one  floated along that gentle stream and out onto the shimmering  surface of the Bay, then indeed one could "rave" and still be  truthful. Biscayne Bay is beyond doubt the most beautiful sheet  of water in the Americas and its marvelous colors and matchless  beauty defy description.  The beauty of Miami's Bay, the fragrance of the flowers, the  health-restoring powers of the climate, would alone have attracted  and held an ever increasing family of enthusiasts but it would have  grown in a slow and gradual way and would still be just the little  village, delightfully appealing, that it was in the late '90s. The  Miami of those days is well illustrated by the following.  "On a bright moonlight night, in the spring of 1896, a number  of pioneers plunged into the Miami River, at the foot of Avenue  D and were enjoying swimming from shore to shore. In the  midst of this refreshing exercise the terrifying cry of "Alligator"  broke the stillness of the night and precipitated the swimmers  into a scramble for safety to the banks of both sides of the stream.  One of the bathers, a former resident of Fort Pierce, who had  studied the habits of the alligator in its haunts on the shores of  the Indian River felt the closing jaws of a monster alligator upon  his shoulder. Without emitting a sound he injected the tips of  his fingers into the eyes of the brute and was instantly released.  After having his wounds cauterized, he secured a row-boat and  rifle and set out on an alligator hunt vowing to kill the brute  that attacked him. He persisted in the hunt for several nights  until he finally located and slew the monster." *  But many who came to rest and play felt the challenge of the  untouched wilderness. Free of prejudice and appraising the possibilities with keen and well trained eyes, to their vision and energy  as well as to their capital must all credit be given for the growth  that gave to Miami the name "Magic City."  It is no discredit to the others to say that the outstanding leader  of them all was Henry M. Flagler. Born in 1830, for years an  executive of Standard Oil, Flagler built a monument that will stand  for a long time—the Florida East Coast Railway—and that Seventh  Wonder of the  Modern  World—the  Overseas  Railway to  Key  * Isidor Cohen in "Historical Sketches and Sidelights of Miami, Florida."  THE    WORLD'S    MIAMI  West. Today Wm. R. Kenan, Jr., President, and H. N. Roden-  baugh, Executive Vice President carry on the work so ably started  by Flagler. The already famous southern railroad that is rapidly  becoming the Florida competitor of Flagler's railroad is headed by  another outstanding, farseeing leader and executive, S. Davies War-  field of the Seaboard Air Line.  It is significant that the killing frost of 1895-96 which did such  heavy damage throughout the entire state and even as far south  as Palm Beach failed to touch the farms and groves of the little  community at the mouth of the Miami River. In the eyes of  Flagler its immunity from that frost gave Miami still greater importance and he was convinced that Miami and her extensive back  country held a promise as yet undreamt. The order to extend  the Florida East Coast Railway to Miami from Palm Beach, its  terminus at that time, was immediately given and by summer, 1896,  the extension was an accomplished fact. About the same time  Miami's first bank was organised and the city received its charter,  thus making   1896 the real beginning of Miami.  The problems and handicaps were many and nature was stubborn. The baby city faced a terrific struggle. Even in 1900 Miami  could only boast of a population of 1681—a mere handful for such  a herculean task. Dade County, with Miami the county seat then  comprised an area over twice the size of Delaware and larger than  Connecticut. Yet, Dade County's population was but 4955.

The enthusiasm of the visitors who were coming in larger num-  bers and staying longer each time, encouraged the pioneers in  their task, and they needed encouragement. The transportation  of materials and supplies of all kinds was costly and uncertain.  Civilization—real civilization—was an almost impossible distance  away. Roads were not dependable at all. In 1904 Dade County  with a coast line of 90 miles had but 35 miles of state and county  roads. Flagler's railroad was but a single track and light travel  and little freight business in those early days necessitated both few  trains and slow schedules. Boats were few and far between and  there was no harbor. Mosquitoes at certain seasons were unbear-  able. Wild bears were occasionally killed at the very edge of  the settlement.  Gradually the wilderness was pushed back, swamps were filled  in, mosquitoes and other tropical pests were somewhat subdued,  wild plant life was put to use and the little city became more beautiful and more livable than ever. Bridges spanned the Miami  River, truck farms and groves produced handsome profits, the  tourists went home delighted with their stay and came again. The  scoffers were legion but the pioneers would not be downed.  Henry M. Flagler once remarked to the Reverend E. V. Black'  man, still living and 82 years of age, from whose book a quotation  was above taken. "I do not expect during my life time to get any  monetary gain from the vast expenditure of time, money and  thought I am making in Florida. If I am spared long enough to  carry out my plans, I shall be satisfied . . . The building of the  Florida East Coast Railroad and the opening up of the wilderness  will not, I am sure, be effaced by time, but rather will grow in  value as the years go by and as the people come in to 'possess  the land'. I am confident that the railroad I am building will in  time become the most valuable railroad property in the world."  By 1905 Miami's population was 4733, by 1910 5471, and by  1915 15,592. New manpower was speeding the work of conquering  the obstacles. New progress enhanced the old advantages. Miami  was coming into its own. The Overseas Railway was an acconv  plished fact and was enjoying an unusual prosperity. A bridge  spanned Biscayne Bay from Miami to the peninsula (called by  some an island or a key) that parallels the mainland and borders  the Atlantic Ocean, a bridge conceived and constructed by John  S. Collins after passing his seventieth milestone. Tens of thousands  of cubic yards of sand were being pumped from the bottom of Bis-  cayne Bay to make that peninsula solid land of a highly desirable  nature instead of a mosquito infested swamp.    Even Flagler missed  10  THE   WORLD'S    MIAMI  the possibilities there but Collins, the ''father of the Beach," now  eighty-nine years of age, had the vision and the vigor that have  so prevailed among Miami's pioneers. Today it is the City of  Miami Beach, with many palatial winter estates, hundreds of less  pretentious homes, beautiful apartments, gigantic hotels, schools,  churches, theaters and all.  It was just work, more work and still more work. The greatest  need was man-power. As the visions of Flagler, Collins, Lummus,  Fisher, Curtiss Pancoast, Bright and Merrick took more definite  form, more man-power appeared and more money was poured into  the task.*  New hotels, new apartments, new homes were built each summer during the off-season and each year the skeptics said they  would never be filled. Yet, each season found the supply insufficient to meet the demand and again the work went on.  The 1920 Federal Census reported for Miami 29,57l?t a growth  in 20 years of over 1750%. The progress continued. Years of  effort were crowned with success when the first coastwise, steamship entered through Miami's new channel to the Atlantic. The  city began to spread. Out in the Southwest was heard the first  lusty cry of the "babe" that was destined to cause the world to  talk—Coral Gables.  The years 1923, 1924, 1925 and 1926 each saw more and more  progress, greater and greater accomplishments. Opposition was by  no means removed.    Both nature's forces and man's weaknesses  * Many others whose names are not mentioned deserve equal credit,  f Federal Census of December,  1926 gave permanent population of Miami  proper as   131,286;  suburb cities  not included.

This rapid glance we have given at the phenomenal developments of Greater Miami, the East Coast and South Florida gives  little enough of the detail of a great accomplishment. However,  we have seen that Florida, larger in area than New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois or Michigan was in 1860 but a vast wilderness,  with less than three persons per square mile. After the war it  was isolated from the progressive North by a depressed backward  and disrupted South that was fighting valiantly for its own economic  and  social  existence.  Not until 1910 did the automobile begin to have general distribution and prior to that time travel except by train was a long  and arduous task. The present Miami (not in existence in 1890)  was not even approachable by land until 1896 and even thereafter  it was a matter of no little difficulty for a northerner to journey  southward to a point over a thousand miles below Virginia.  Is it not remarkable that Florida grew in size and prosperity at  all in the face of those conditions? Yet, grow it did, even before  the coming of the automobile as witnessed by these figures.  Growth in Population:  From From From  1880 to 1900 to 1910 to  1900 1910 1925  Entire Country     50% 20% 25%  Entire South*     42% 16% 19%  Florida   100% 45% 65%  Texas   100% 25% 38%  And in the light of the same conditions, is it not still more  amazing that while the state of Florida was growing 100% from  1880 to 1900 South Florida grew almost 230%. Between 1900  and 1910 South Florida grew 75% as against Florida's 45%. Between '10 and '25 South Florida grew 150% against Florida's 65%.  Whether or not we correctly appraise the human urge or the  underlying cause of such a persistent and enviable growth over a  period of half a century it cannot be denied that it was founded  and could only be founded on economic laws of absolute soundness. It further seems to be a fundamental fact that such progress  and such growth never have, never will and cannot suddenly cease.  As to the nature of those fundamental factors and the specific  influence they have had and may be expected to have on Metropolitan Miami, the succeeding pages give detailed consideration.  * Carolinas, Virginia, West Virginia, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi,  Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Maryland, District of Columbia,  Oklahoma.  Chapter II  GOD'S COUNTRY  "To fight cold we recommend brick walls,  a furnace or a railway ticket with emphasis on  the railway ticket and the destination, Miami."  #oHE removal of the snow following a single snow storm in  1921 cost New York City over one million dollars. Cleveland's annual coal bill for heating purposes alone exceeds sixteen  million dollars, or more than the operating cost of its entire public  school system.  Thus, there is a direct cost to certain of nature's phenomena  making full consideration of their relative merits worth-while. I  was in the city of Cleveland during June 1927, and recall particularly, Thursday June 9. The sun shone gloriously, a gentle wind  was blowing constantly and the odor of flowers was borne upon  the breeze. It was all the more evident by contrast with the murky  dreariness of the preceding days during which chill winds caused  even the year around residents to button up overcoats and pull  down tighter on the winter hats.  But, on Thursday one threw back the head, drew a deep breath  of the invigorating air and took delight in walking across the grass  in the sunshine, watching many many others sunning themselves  on park bench or elsewhere. Windows were wide, smiles prevailed  and the most frequent comment was "Isn't it a glorious day?"    .  Mere words will not adequately describe such a day, but  golfers, bare headed and coatless, were so delighted as they trudged  the rolling fairways, absorbing the benevolent warmth of the sun  and gating with rapture upon sky and tree and distant colorful  home that the score was as much forgotten as any enthusiastic golfer  can ever forget his score.  That day is typical of many such days usually enjoyed by  Cleveland during June, July and August.

It is the good fortune of the peerless Miami to experience from  October 15 to May 15 of each year, day after day of glorious sunshine, exotic breeze and benevolent warmth that are very similar  to Cleveland's finest day. The gulf stream keeps the temperature  very steady, generally, neither too warm nor too cold, but now  and then chill breezes of a northern storm reach southward and  make a roaring fire in the open fireplace a delightful pleasure in  evening and morning. However, a few days later the balmy days  return and the snap of the cold days that necessitated buttoned-up  top coat and perhaps driving gloves makes greater one's appreciation  of the coatless and hatless freedom of Miami's usual day.  Miami's summer months, long considered unendurable by those  who did not experience them are of course warm. The report of  the U. S. Government station here shows that, at rare intervals a  temperature of 96° has been attained. A temperature between 80°  and 90° is quite usual, this being varied by the frequent rains  which lower the thermometer materially. Northern cool spells also  sometimes affect the territory to a slight degree. However, one  who has become accustomed to northern cold and has acquired the  habit of moving even more swiftly and energetically than necessary,  in order to keep warm, feels uncomfortable until life and habits  have been adjusted to the new surroundings. Then good spirits,  plenty of energy and more general good health are enjoyed than  ever before. Especially is that fact apparent to those, born up  north, who visit back in the north for a time and then return to  Miami where day by day they feel that they accomplish more than  possible elsewhere.  In the northern cities it not infrequently occurs that huge steel  mills are obliged to shut down in the summer because of the terrific  heat, while in the winter the workmen undergo much discomfort  as they freeze one side and bake the other before the huge furnaces.  In that connection Miami's climate will be a great help to the future  steel worker here. With 96% the highest official temperature  ever recorded, such a heat as forces shut-downs up north could  never occur, while the breezes sweeping through a properly constructed plant would very very materially add to the workman's  comfort, health and peace of mind. In the winter the advantages  would be even greater.  Typical of the misunderstanding of many people of conditions  in South Florida was the remark by a friend of mine, who had a  mental picture of the softness of the asphalt in Cleveland's streets  in summer, "Oh! do they use asphalt in Miami?    Is it possible to  14  THE     WORLD'S     MIAMI  use it successfully down there?" He was surprised to learn that  on most of Dade County's roads and streets, the pavements are  asphalt and the sun is not hot enough to soften it as much as it  is sometimes softened in Cleveland.  Being the father of two children whom he and his wife are  careful to keep out of the intense Cleveland sun of July and August, he was further quite astonished to learn that in Miami and  South Florida generally parents permit their children to play out  in the sun throughout the entire summer, without hat or other  head covering and without the slightest fear of a sun stroke from  so doing.  And how really marvelous that sun is. The grandfather of the  children referred to was, in 1914, very ill, his life being even  despaired of. Although he himself little expected to arrive at  Miami alive, a few months here proved to be the tonic he needed  and his physical comeback was fine. A former Federal Attorney-  general arrived in Miami on crutches a terribly sick man. The  daily sun, the salt water made him again a picture of health and  vigor. A young lady friend of mine was brought to Miami four  years ago. Enroute two blood transfusions were necessary to prolong life. She must still be careful but the sun and outdoor life  have removed all outward traces of her almost fatal illness and  she now leads a strenuous social life that would tax the endurance  of many in the best of health.  Science turns more and more to sunshine in its battle against  disease.

Barron, the noted business and financial authority  stated in a recent speech "Wealth is more from the sun than from  the soil. Up at old Cape Cod we have found that you can make  gardens of flowers and vegetables grow in the sands cast up by the  ocean. Soil is only one of the factors in production. Do you know  that the major part of every tree is taken by the leaves of the  tree from the nitrogen in the atmosphere?"  Perhaps the foregoing gives the reason, or, perhaps it is just  because of the enjoyment of health and outdoor life and freedom,  but at any rate, many there arq (and they can be numbered by  the thousands )who have made the statement—and meant it—that  they would be willing for five months of the year to endure any  of the trying climates of the world, if they could only, during the  other seven months of each year, be in Miami and enjoy Miami's  surpassing excellence.  One naturally wonders how Miami's summer climate does compare with other climates. The Statistical Abstract of the U. S.  compares Miami with New Orleans as follows:  Average of Daily Maximum Temperatures  for the month of  June July August     September  New  Orleans     87.8 89.3 89 86  Miami       85.3 86.8 87.1 85.8  Highest Temperature on Record  New Orleans   102 102 100 98  Miami        94 96 96 95  A friend of mine living in Baton Rouge, Louisiana (75 miles  north of New Orleans) writes that a temperature of 118° and  120° is not uncommon there and that the nights are so hot and  uncomfortable that he and his friends frequently take one or more  shower baths during the night in order to induce slumber.  People who have moved from Augusta or Macon, Georgia or  Montgomery, Alabama or other similar centers of considerable  importance have found Miami cooler and more comfortable in  summer than their former city of residence.  Thus Miami combines a most appealing and delightful seven  months winter climate with a five months summer that is much  more comfortable than the summers of many large and thriving  cities whose winters are decidedly unhealthy, uncomfortable and  undesirable.  "Apart from the delightful climate and other conditions, which  always make one's stay in Florida most enjoyable from every view  point, I would say that the big point that comes into my mind  16  THE     WORLD'S     MIAMI  was that at least many sections of Florida are wonderfully inviting  the year round as places for health, recreation and business," said  Cordell Hull, Democratic National Committee, Washington, D. C. *  Such is Miami's climate. No part of the United States experiences less of low temperatures than South Florida. It is the only  English-speaking territory that experiences practically no freezing  temperatures at any time.    What will that mean for Miami?  Dr. E. Starr Judd, Rochester, Minn., professor of surgery at  the Mayo Clinic, in an address said * "Florida may not especially  cater to the ill of the nation but the fact remains that when the  medicinal properties in Florida sunshine are more widely known to  the medical world nothing can prevent this great natural offering  of Florida to humanity being utilized.  The present great centers of helio-therapy, where treatment for  tuberculosis of the bone and tissue and other ailments by exposure  to the rays of the sun is given, are located in Europe. There are  several big sanitariums in Switzerland, Italy and other countries  that are doing great work. However, Florida is as well equipped  by nature to handle such treatment as these European health  resorts and I firmly believe that within the next few years private  institutions or state operated sanitariums will be established here."  * Florida Review, April  18,  1927, Tallahassee, Florida.  ....   . m  ,....,*&gt;**   *»  '    *?  *T S-^ 7%&lt;     &gt;  ~ ---".■-..,*- *^     o' tti,::,: ,;■., ,:!,:5  i*- ~   ' .     ~:.' . :   ,,?V    , _W**««~        ■       **  ,  V ■ *    - s ~      - -  ,V^-^:  A World Famous Hotel at Miami Beach as  Host to Sportsmen on  Biscayne Bay  17 		image/tiff						120017670 Bytes	7254	5515	1947732095	RGB	8	600	asc99990000050015001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/950	950	951.jp2	/pamphlets/image/951.jp2

In Miami numerous and great conventions are being and will  be held; in Miami expositions of the southern United States will  be organized, expositions of tropical America, expositions of the  world tropics and expositions whose aim will be a greater, a more  unified and a more advanced Pan America; in Miami great schools  doing their work as much as possible in the open air, will draw  from every state in the Union, students whose parents want to  enjoy their company and guide them and yet want to winter in  Miami.  Thus visitors, delegates, students and tourists, from whatever  country, whatever city they may come will find resident in Miami  an old friend and many old friends to make their stay a mutual  pleasure and gain.

From the same information source we learn that 1,852,120 of  those 75 million reported net incomes of over $3000.00 for that  year and it is therefore reasonable to assume that at least two million enjoyed that income or more. Thus excluding Canadians,  Englishmen and other Europeans there are fully half a million  who can afford to spend either all winter or a good portion of it  in the south and the number that are able financially to tour to  Florida or Miami or vacation here for a few weeks runs into the  millions. One of our leading and most reliable magazines is the  source of the information that nomadic America spends annually  about $3,300,000,000.00. Over $700,000,000 is supposed to have  been left across the Atlantic by tourists alone, last year.  Yet, a winter resident and tourist population of 100,000 in  addition to the permanent residents would comfortably fill Metropolitan Miami. The city is capable of accommodating many more,  perhaps 200,000 in addition to its permanent population, but a  total of 250,000 residents and tourists for an entire season, each  staying the average length of time would be a wonderful season  and immediately the cry would go up that more accommodations  were needed, that cry having been heard every year until the spring  of 1926.  The more one observes and studies, the more one realizes that  the winter resident, the winter tourist, the winter vacationist, the  winter student, and the winter health-seeker possibilities for Metropolitan Miami have scarcely been touched.

The climate was here and so were millions of huge mosquitoes;  the climate was here and so were scorpions, snakes, alligators; the  climate has always been here and so have marshes and swamps;  the climate has always been here and so have miles and miles of  unsurveyed territory touched only by hunter or Indian.  The climate has always been here but until 1926, the city was  entered by but one railroad and by but a single track of that one  railroad; the climate is the same but the transformation that produced what is now the City of Miami Beach was gradual over a  period of years and instead of the present marvelous playground  and city of winter homes there was, originally, in the main, but  mangrove swamp and sand bar; the climate is the same, but it  has only been a few years since the city water was unbearable for  drinking purposes and better water was difficult to obtain; the  climate is just the same but for years ocean bathing could only  be had after a boat trip or a long ride over a wooden toll bridge;  the climate hasn't changed, but even greatly increased facilities each  year failed to provide adequate accommodations for the crowds  that came; the climate's the same but even in 1923 the roads in  Florida to Miami could not be considered good and prior to that  time they were positively dangerous, the roads across the states  from the North to Florida being, as late as the winter of 1924-25,  virtually impassable at certain seasons of the year. One could  continue endlessly.  The fact is that Miami has developed as a snow-ball grows.  Just as the latter cannot grow from a two inch to a yard diameter  in an instant no matter how much snow there is, so Miami with  all its marvelous heritage was prevented by its poverty, its financial  limitations from perfecting itself over-night. The struggle has been  long and arduous. First a railroad, a hotel, a few miles of streets,  then more hotels, more streets, sewers, filling in of marshy places,  more streets, a little advertising, a beach resort, groves, truck  farms, more hotels, new stores, more streets and county roads—  so the snow-ball grew and gained momentum until in 1926 it was  feared that its facilities in some respects exceeded the demand and  further large-scale extension of those particular facilities, such as  hotels, apartment houses and so forth was discontinued.  "The future of this city and state?" asked Mr. Samuel Knox  in February, 1927, executive of Batelle Ludwik 6? Co., New York,  answering the question. "There is no question whatever about the  certain and sure future for Florida. With a monoply on a climate  that cannot be matched, you have a quick and close position with  relation to  the  great population  of the  East  and  North that is  20  t  THE    WORLD'S    MIAMI  scarcely recognized for its worth as yet. Only 36 hours to 41 hours  from New York! And there is no question, either, that travel  by airplane will be a feature of the Florida influx in a very brief  space of time. By August the routes will be shaping up from  New England and New York south. Florida will soon be the other  end of a very short flight for passengers, just as it has already been  for mail.  I have been looking over the wonderfully rich counties of the  state; this background country of yours. There is only one description that fits it—it is the outdoor hot-house of the United  States.  And now, with all this beautiful development in recreation,  beaches, hotels, magnificent streets, what should be the immediate  concern is the bringing in of industries; to build the population  in a balance of pleasure and work. And what an ideal life for  the workers—long hours of sunlight, open air factories with none  of the stuffiness of closed buildings heated artificially, entire absence of sunstroke and heat prostration, ideal living conditions,  opportunities to enjoy practically every delight people come thousands of miles to enjoy."  Miami today is ready—her old unsurpassed climate now supported by marvelous roads from the north and within her own  county; by luxurious through trains on two first class railroads  and by great new steamships of transatlantic proportions, especially  Feminine Pulchritude at Miami Beach,  January,   1927  21 		image/tiff						119912130 Bytes	7274	5495	1296582084	RGB	8	600	asc99990000050017001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/952	952	953.jp2	/pamphlets/image/953.jp2

Consider well the unprecedented prosperity that seems to be  even now but gaining momentum for further record-breaking; consider that there is a general movement southward in our great  nation—a movement akin to the migration of the Huns, the Goths  and the Visigoths to the south of Europe 1500 years ago; consider  that the greatest heighths achieved by man (save only the present  industrial development) were achieved on the shores of the Mediterranean with a climate very much like the climate of the Caribbean, and it is then difficult indeed, in view of the facts related  on previous pages, to doubt but that Climate Alone would truly  make Miami, within ten years, a metropolis of the South ranking  among the first twelve in size in the country.  The Miami Woman's Club  22  Chapter III  INDUSTRY  9V/ETROPOLI-  ^ ° V TAN Miami is  today a city of people  rapidly adjusting themselves to new conditions and finding new  local fields of endeavor in which they may  expend their energies  to advantage. Many  have already become  established in industrial or agricultural  pursuits.  Miami is proving to  be a striving example  of the type of city  that, having grown because of certain conditions, to a greater size  than justified by its industrial development or the agricultural production of its back country, turns its energies, brains and money  into its industrial and agricultural growth and with rapid strides  develops both to their proper importance.  Many cities today, owe their size to the growth of certain  great manufacturing plants which have in greater and greater numbers drawn employees from other places. On the other hand, there  are many other cities, and of these Miami is one, in which industrial establishments have been started by men who chose first their  place of residence and second their means of livelihood.  This phase of the development of industrial plants is referred to  by authors of text books of recognized standing.

The  nature of many a city's industry has been shaped ... in the early  days of its history by the decision of one man." *  "Going back to the origins of the plant, you find that the personal equation entered largely into the location. Convenience and  sentiment still control in the placing of countless industries . . . the  suitability of any factory site breaks up into a number of unit  questions. How near and how accessible is the market for your  product? What are the transportation facilities and' rates, and the  chances of alternative service during car shortage? ..." etc., etc. t  "The location of many factories in surroundings not at all favorable to cheapness of production has been due to the fact that  their founders, realizing the local demand, started the establishment  in the best sales market . . . " *  "The advantage of direct contact with the consumer that is  offered by a factory in a large city is well worth considering. Frequent instances may be found where, after removal of a factory  which has found its city site disadvantageous as compared with a  location in the suburbs or the country, some newcomer has been  able to start a thriving establishment near the old site with perhaps  less profits but still reaping the advantage of this close touch with  in the best sales market ..." J  "Some industries can only be advantageously located near the  market where the finished product is to be sold . . . Often the industry derives a large income from the sale of by-products which  do not bear transportation, or it may be that the products are  produced largely to order, in which case nearness to the market is  almost always necessary." §  It seems from this consideration of the subject that as regards  which comes to a city first, population or industry, there are cases  of centralized population being due to industrial development and  other cases of industrial development being due to a concentration  of population.  A concentration of population having taken place at Miami,  along the southeast coast and elsewhere in Florida it is found  necessary to import tremendous quantities of foodstuffs and manufacturers.

That several times as much manufactured  goods was shipped in is a conservative statement and later figures  will undoubtedly dwarf those quoted here.  In later pages Miami's back country and its possibilities are  discussed. Suffice it to say, at this point, that if the expectations  of those who are in a position to know, are fulfilled, the thousands  of acres surrounding Miami will be dotted with many prosperous  and growing communities, and such an outcome would alone stimulate, in no small way, the industrial growth of Miami.  Every day almost two and one-half million dollars of American  products—mostly finished materials—are shipped from United  States to the West Indies and Central and South America. Miami  is the nearest great United States city to that market. Could a  city be more advantageously located to manufacture for that trade  than Miami?  Thus the prime requisite for industry—market—now exists to  the extent of many millions of dollars within the state. A further  great market will be created by development of the back country.  A nearby foreign market, growing by leaps and bounds, is nearer  Miami than any other large center. That illustrates Miami's situation as regards market.  The second great requirement is a source of raw materials and  it will be observed as the list of industries below is scanned that,  in each case either Miami is as well provided with the raw material necessary to that industry, as most centers manufacturing that  * L.

The industries listed below have been selected because they  seem to be found in all sections of the country and because "nearness to market" seems to play the greatest part in the location of  the separate plants. In none of these industries is Miami at a real  disadvantage considering all factors and in many her position in  regard thereto is so advantageous as to be almost strategic.

Frankly, based upon the experience of other centers, Miami  cannot fail to grow industrially to an extent commensurate with its  greatness as a city. Even lack of organisation, absence of public  cooperation could not keep energetic citizens from grasping the  opportunities presented in Metropolitan Miami, but, observers are  much encouraged by signs of a cooperation that is speeding development.

The product of the efforts of all those people is obviously excluded  from the table given above. Yet, Florida, the undeveloped wilderness, in spite of the inclusion in the population figure of even all  those who produced nothing of manufactures, minerals and farm  products, produced almost half as much per capita as did the entire  United States. Metropolitan Miami alone issued building permits in  1925 and 1926 totaling approximately $140,000,000.00 and the men  who did that work, as well as those doing all other similar development work throughout the state were included in the population calculations.  Metropolitan Miami is, moreover, not without sources of raw  materials for industry, as the data following will show: *  Canning of preserves, jellies, fruit juices, pickles—reference to  the chapter on agriculture will indicate how tremendous this one  business can become. In addition, the extraordinarily productive  West Indies furnish untold quantities of foodstuffs, much of  which will, of necessity, require preservation for long distance shipment. The sub-tropical climate permits of the rotation and timing  of crops according to the most advantageous schedule, thus enabling  the canning and allied industries to keep their plants in operation  continuously.  Milk, butter, cheese—so far the dairies have failed to produce  sufficient of their products to meet the demand at the peak of the  winter season. However, there is today a surplus production during  the summer season and a local cheese industry of considerable proportions is a strong probability.  Poultry, eggs—millions of dollars of poultry products are imported annually into Florida and it is claimed that Florida and particularly the Miami area, with its coral rock surface formation offers  unexcelled natural advantages for the raising and marketing of  poultry.  A very fine grade of silica sand in unlimited quantities is to  be had at the very door of Miami. Silica sand is the prime essential for plate and bottle glass.  Tanic acid, so necessary to the leather industry, is found in  abundance in the palmetto plant. Attention is directed to ship  loads of green hides averaging over 400 tons per day from South  America passing within a few miles of the port of Miami, to tanneries of the north, where later it becomes the leather products  of the industry and in considerable quantities is shipped back to  Florida and Miami.  * The  source   of  this  information   is   U.   S.   Government  statistics  and  the  "Miamian", official organ of the Miami Chamber of Commerce.  28  THE    WORLD'S    MIAMI  The furniture manufacturing industry has within a two hours  auto ride of Miami, a twenty year supply of mahogany timber. In the  West Indies there exists some of the most beautiful of tropical  hard woods to be found anywhere in the world. Labor and water  transportation can place the lumber in Miami at a nominal cost.  The growing of reeds for reed furniture manufacture has wonderful possibilities, and the manufacture of reed furniture now being  produced locally is of a type that has drawn attention from all over  the country.  At the Federal Demonstration Farms near here, there are successfully grown two hundred and thirteen varieties of medicinal  herbs used in pharmaceutical laboratories. The establishment of  laboratories at the source of supply and in the center of distribution for North and South America, places Greater Miami in a  strategical position for competition with any other place in the  world.  The chemical industry is fairly well established, insecticides,  deodorants, polishes and drain solvents being produced. The production of indigo dye, the tanning of shark and alligator hides, etc.  are under consideration.  Colombia and Venezuela are rapidly attaining position of  World importance in petroleum production and the surface there  has not yet even been scratched.  One thousand tons of coffee pass Miami daily going northward  from South America.  Cuba sent the United States 567,000 tons of iron ore last year.  Chili sent 1,300,000 tons.

If I were  to take an ordinary flower pot, filled with the choicest soil procurable, and in it plant a grain of corn, and allow that flower pot  to stand in the sunshine for ninety days, I would produce a stalk  of corn that would weigh something like 2700 times the weight  of the original grain. And, if I should take that stalk of corn  and dry it and burn it, in addition to getting a considerable amount  of heat out of it, I would get a small amount of ash, about four  per cent of the total weight of the stalk of corn. That four per  cent represents the amount that was taken out of the soil, and  if I would put it back in there each succeeding 90 days, I could  raise just exactly the same size stalk. The 95 per cent of the  weight of the stalk of corn was the work done by the sun in  picking from the air water vapor, which is always present, decomposed carbon dioxide, which comes out of every combustion  in the world and breaks that apart and builds up that stalk of corn.  So that 95 per cent of all the food we eat is really sunshine. If  you were to plant that grain of corn in pure sea sand which had  been thoroughly washed so that it had no vegetable matter in it,  you could, by adding certain chemicals as you poured the water  over it, raise just as large a stalk of corn as if it had been planted  in good soil.  As I understand it, in the Everglades there are all the essential  chemicals necessary to produce the thing we call fertility."  According to the report of Nathan Mayo, Commissioner of  Agriculture of Florida, issued in 1926, giving agricultural statistics  for 1924, there are in Dade County alone 1,450,720 acres. Of that  total, 409,331 acres were reported as being in farms in 1924 but  only 79,748 acres were in actual cultivation. Thus over 300,000  acres, already in farms, were not in use in 1924 although in large  part the character of the soil of these idle acres was the same as of  the acres under cultivation. Poor roads and lack of transportation  facilities as well as lack of finances and labor were important factors  in preventing those acres from being put to use. According to the  same report, the products of the 79,748 acres exceeded six million  dollars.  Additional acres have been brought under cultivation since  then but even today thousands upon thousands of acres of good  land are available on which to produce crops for which a huge  market exists in Florida alone and for which a northern market  exists that is literally almost unlimited. There are in addition  almost a million acres in the Everglades in Dade County, a part  of which is suitable for production now for one crop a year.  It is not to be supposed that just because these possibilities  exist, there will be an over-night exodus of farmers from all over  34  THE     W O R L D'S    MIAMI  the world into Florida. Nor is it desirable that there should be.  Besides, neither is it represented that this great area will make the  new-comer wealthy over-night or in a few months.  On the other hand farmers are coming in from the North and  more acres are coming under cultivation. New problems face these  people. The climate that is so beneficial to plant and human life  is also beneficial to fungus and parasite growth. These problems  solved and the difficulties of a new existence conquered, a problem  demanding the highest order of intelligence and a great spirit of  cooperation is faced—efficient and organised marketing. Not that  the market does not already exist or that the people must be educated, for a nearby market of great scope and a more distant market  of unlimited scope are already here but the one problem of timing  the produce and balancing the production of different crops and  getting the produce to the consumer in the proper condition quickly,  requires men of the highest caliber.  That, however, is not a Florida problem but a problem of the  farmer everywhere. It is however intensified in South Florida because of the concentration in certain crops. The important factors  are these:—the South Florida farmer, can, on cheaper land, produce  as great a yield per acre per crop, can produce it at the most advantageous time of year, can produce more than one crop per year  One of the  Homes of Metropolitan Miami,  of which  there are Forty  Thousand  ranging  from  Palatial  Estates  to  Modest  Cottages  35 		image/tiff						118906545 Bytes	7213	5495	1051179014	RGB	8	600	asc99990000050024001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/959	959	960.jp2	/pamphlets/image/960.jp2

The South  Florida farmer, outside the Everglades overflow district is less subject to blight and frost or other damaging loss hazards than most  farmers, in fact has almost absolute control against flood, frost  and drought. (In some sections of the North, what are called  Cthot winds" fairly burn up the crops.) But, best of all, if something does happen to a Dade county crop, it can be planted again  the next day. In the north there is but one chance a year and  in case of failure an entire year must be wasted.  Given such advantages (and they are not merely theoretical  advantages but are rather very definite and tangible and can be  illustrated by thousands upon thousands of cases) can there be but  one future for Southeastern Florida agriculturally and that an extremely bright and prosperous one?  James R. Mellon of the Mellon National Bank, at Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania, is credited by the Florida Review of April 18, 1927  with saying:  "Last winter I spent my fortieth season at Palatka, Florida.  On my first trip there I liked the climate and the people so well  that I arranged for a winter home. In the forty years the developments have been marvelous—land I thought could not possibly  ever produce a crop is now flourishing, such as the Hastings potato  section, the Sanford celery section and the cabbage country over  towards Micanopy. There is no doubt in my mind or I think in  the minds of others who have seen the crops of Florida, that every  part of the state may be brought to the highest cultivation."  And thus we approach consideration of the Everglades, that  much discussed, much misunderstood Empire, larger than Connecticut and almost as large as New Jersey or Massachusetts, situated  between the strips of land that form the coastal territory of South  Florida on the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean and extending between these strips from the southern tip of Florida to about  twenty miles north of Lake Okeechobee.  According to the reports of experts, the Everglades are above  sea level, Lake Okeechobee itself having an altitude of approximately seventeen feet. Since 1904, when Napoleon B. Broward, a  candidate for Governor of Florida and later elected, with great  leadership initiated the reclamation of that vast territory, many  eminent engineers have pronounced the draining of the Everglades  possible and practicable. Horticultural experts and farmers have  declared Everglades soil to be of extraordinary richness and its plant  production simply amazing.  Governor John W. Martin, of Florida in a speech at St. Petersburg, Florida, July 15,  1927 spoke as follows:  36  THE   W O R L D'S   MIAMI  I hold in my hand ... a letter from R. G. Dahlberg, president  of the Celotex Company. His firm owns 48,000 * acres of land  in the Everglades, none of it for sale and on which they will spend  three million dollars in planting sugar cane and erecting a sugar  refinery by October of 1928. In this letter he also states that they  expect to spend around twenty-five to thirty million dollars in developing the sugar industry in the Everglades furnishing employment to between twenty-five and thirty thousand people; that he  considers it the richest land in the United States and that he believes that the Florida Everglades and Louisiana can furnish all the  sugar used in Continental America and that means $500,000,000  worth of sugar a year.  His firm is the largest producer of cane in the United States  and has about $25,000,000 to $30,000,000 invested in the state of  Louisiana."  Governor Martin also said:  "I also have a letter from the Brown Company of Portland,  Maine, that owns 70,000 acres in the Everglades. They state that  they have made searches all over America and found the Everglades  of Florida the best land, after six years of research, to produce  peanuts on . . . They have spent over a million dollars in the Everglades and expect to spend millions more in cultivating this land,  raising peanuts, furnishing labor to thousands of people, using the  peanuts to make a preparation like Crisco.    They have no land  * At Baltimore, Md., in July   18,   1927, Mr.  Dahlberg made the statement  that he owned or controlled almost  100,000 acres of Everglades land.

Brown, representative of the Brown Company, referred to above, in Baltimore, July 19, 1927, spoke as follows: "I  have been going to Florida myself off and on three or four times  a year for three or four years and I have gotten very much interested in the possibilities that are there and I am very much of  an optimist on what can be done. When we looked into Florida  we became quite enthusiastic but before acquiring any land there  we made experiments. We had some eight crops of peanuts and  we found it was possible to raise the peanuts. Some agriculturists  said they would not grow, that we would not get oil. As you  know we had three very bad years. We were flooded out. But,  we finally worked out a very good system of cultivation of this  land. We have found out how to plow it and how to harrow it  and how to plant it. There was no planting machine for peanuts  on a large scale. They had little things they ran with a mule and  that sort of business would not do for a large process. We have  a machine today that will plant two hundred and forty miles of  peanuts in nine hours with two men.  The control of that water level is the primary thing and I  believe that this is absolutely possible in the Everglades today.,  Florida has several million acres of land that is the most productive  land in the world, this is capable of raising calories sufficient to  feed ten million people if every acre of it was farmed in an uv  tensive way."  In May 1927 Capt. F. Deane Duff, president of the board of  supervisors of the Sugarland drainage district announced that absolute water control had been established on 10,000 acres of the  Sugarland Drainage District adjacent to Clewiston. He stated that  while nine dredges continue to work in other parts of the district,  virtually 10,000 acres of land in close proximity to Clewiston town-  site, once subject to periodical overflows are now free from either  that menace or that of drought.  The total area of Sugarland Drainage District, according to  Captain Duff, is a little in excess of 43,000 acres. The drainage  plan for the entire district calls for the erection of 37 miles of  levees; 138 miles of ditches; at least one pumping plant of 180,000  gallons per minute capacity and four water controls located at  strategic points in the district. He also stated that the land included  muck, sand and muck, sandy loam and a few hundred acres of  pine land.  Thus are we given assurance of the ultimate success in bringing  the Everglades under cultivation; we are told of the confidence  evidenced by great corporations backing their confidence with millions; and, we learn of actual progress being made.  38  THE   WORLD'S   MIAMI  Other areas, by local systems of dikes and pumps are being  brought under control on a smaller scale, and the marvelous combination of glorious daily sunshine, even, moderate climate, absolute water control and extraordinary richness of soil bids fair to  offer possibilities that may hasten the readjustment of the rural  life of our nation.  "It is a stupendous fact that Florida can support twelve million  people without crowding and still supply the rest of the United  States with winter vegetables and fruits, augmenting our shipments  to more than one million cars annually. The population of the  United States is increasing at the rate of one million every twelve  months, and its wealth at the rate of twelve billion dollars. The  demands for what we produce are growing accordingly, but the  startling significance begins to dawn upon us that the spot of  production for citrus fruits and winter vegetables can never be enlarged. Our only competitor is California but it will be sufficient  for my purpose to remind you that the northern boundary of our  state is south of the southern boundary of the 'Golden Bear' ... I  find my heart as well as my mind, captured by this new empire-in-  the-making; and it is, after all, forever true that heart interests are  the eternal values." *  This is the day of huge, large-scale operations. The Hawaiian  Pineapple Company bought the entire island of Lanai in the South  Seas, comprising 90,000 acres, unpopulated and growing only  cactus, on which to grow the pineapples demanded by the public.  Its development is costing $5,000,000.00.  This also is the day advantageous to the manufacturer and the  city dweller as against the farmer. The sale price of a farmer's  produce has advanced little in comparison with the increase in  taxes, interest charges and the cost of maintaining a standard of  living comparable to that of his city brother. The farmer's increase in per acre production has on the whole, been small. The  farmer has the choice of transferring his efforts to the field of  industry or to farm lands from which a greater yield per dollar  of investment and a greater yield per acre per year can be obtained.  To both, the large scale operator and the individual farmer,  South Florida beckons and to those of intelligence and industry  who come, that marvelous back-country to Metropolitan Miami will  truly be known with gratitude as "The Land of Opportunity of  America."  : J.

Of Cuba's total exports the  same year of $353,000,000 the United States received $262,000,000.  Our domination of Cuba's foreign commerce is duplicated in the  other republics of North America as follows: Of all their exports  (Cuba, Mexico, Guatemala, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Salvador,  Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras and Panama) totaling $830,000,-  000 the United States purchased $575,000,000. Of all their imports totaling $627,000,000 the United States furnished $412,000,-  000. In a similar way but of course to a less extent our country  plays the most important part in the commerce of all of South  America.  In buying from the United States, Latin America's purchasing  power is derived from tremendous shipments of raw materials to  us. To be able to purchase more per capita of luxuries as manufactured by us they must increase the efficiency of their producing  machinery. In order to sell them more of our manufactured products we must assist them in increasing their efficiency and we must  educate them to want our luxuries and to want a higher standard  of living. The latter is to create the desire and the former that  they may have thq products with which to pay for the luxuries  they are learning and will learn more to demand.  That great strides have been made along this line is unnecessary of proof. The United States has passed all rivals. Requiring  as little proof similarly, is the statement that development of these  countries has hardly begun. In Cuba alone, it is a well known fact  that intensive cultivation with modern methods, modern machinery  and the help of a good system of roads would increase the per acre  and per inhabitant yield of agricultural products, not two fold or  a hundred fold but a thousand fold.  40  THE    WORLD'S    MIAMI  The present production of all materials is the work, in large  measure ,of uneducated, stolid natives, using haphazard methods,  and great areas of land have not been brought under cultivation at  all, are, in fact practically unapproachable.  "The age of manufacturing in Latin America has scarcely begun; her countries are largely undeveloped and are agricultural or  mining and must remain so for many years to come. Latin America  will need manufactured goods such as we can furnish, she will  need machinery, railway and road material, and especially she will  need capital for public improvements and equipment of all kinds  to care for the tremendous economic development which has just  begun.  We need trade, not with European manufacturing countries,  but with undeveloped agricultural regions. We need all of the  products which South America can furnish—rubber, nitrates, coffee,  sugar, hard woods, tropical fruits, hides, wool and many others.  We need markets for our manufactured goods, machinery and especially for our banking capital." *  Stuart Chase, in "Philadelphia," the official organ of the Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce, writes "Up to July 1, 1925 the  total investment by American capital abroad was estimated at  $9,522,000,000.00 by the United States Department of Commerce .  . .

All signs point to a steady movement in 1926. Many economists  predict a total of $25,000,000,000 of private capital abroad by 1935;  $25,000,000,000 it will certainly be if the present rate of expansion  is maintained. The heaviest investments are in the Americas,  Canada, and the land south of the Rio Grande."  And in the opinion of Victor M. Cutter,* "All factors are  present for vastly increased and mutually satisfactory trade. Business men of integrity will unite to bring about the greatest progress ever made in any era, which will give to North and South  America—the whole Western Hemisphere—the industrial, economic, and cultural leadership of the world."  In the very center of this territory is Miami. Miami is nearer  by water haul to the West coast of South America than Los Angeles.  That Miami will become the American focal point from which  Latin American development will be directed; that great warehouses and assembling plants will appear here; that along with  Miami's industrial development, there will appear industries to meet  demands peculiar to Latin America, which Miamians will best  understand; that other industries, some of them of huge proportions,  will spring up because of Miami's advantage in nearness and low  transportation cost; that a considerable portion of the raw materials now shipped past Miami's port will stop to be manufactured  into the finished product here, thus eliminating unnecessary transportation expense on raw and finished material; that Miami will  become a trans-shipment point for the accumulation of smaller  cargoes of similar destination; that Miami will send her citrus fruits  and avocados by direct boat to Southampton, Brest, Le'Havre and  other European ports to meet the demand now existing in a small  way that has positively unlimited possibilities; that great ocean liners  will sail from Miami to carry South Florida winter visitors on  European trips; that ship lanes will radiate from Miami to the  seas of the world, but particularly to the South seas of the Americas, so that trips combining business and pleasure will be made  to that vast territory of unrivaled resources that is just being opened  up; that Miami will become financial headquarters for much of the  new capital to be invested to the south; that Miami will boast of  shipyards and dry docks; that Miami will become a World Metro-  polis—a New York of the Caribbean—all these seem but the natural  outcome of the future.  In 1926, the water-borne cargoes that passed the tip of the  Florida peninsula exceeded in tons by 25% the total water-borne  See footnote on previous page.  42  THE   WORLD'S   MIAMI  exports and imports in tons for the same year of New York City,  Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore and the entire State of Virginia  combined.  Read that again. More freight tonnage passed near Miami last  year than the combined exports and imports that passed through  the greatest industrial centers on the Atlantic seaboard. In other  words, we are now almost in the path of the ship lanes of the  world. To enter Miami's new harbor, that shipping will have to  increase its journey on the average less than 1%.  Congressman S. Wallace Dempsey of New York, chairman of  the House of Representatives rivers and harbors committee at  Washington has stated "be assured that the foreign trade is certain  to come and the Miami and Florida of yesterday and today will  not compare with the splendid Miami and Florida of tomorrow."  With this development will come a forced economic change in  some phases of our national life on which we must touch. Where  will all the additional potatoes, sugar, citrus, beans, tomatoes, avo-  cadoes, coffee, bananas, dates, figs, celery, cabbage, lettuce and  so forth go? There is food enough for all today, how can more  be consumed?    It is a valid question.  Each year marketing difficulties or difficulties in controlling and  limiting output bring down prices and cause the cry to be raised  that "overproduction is ruining the farmer." At the same time  departments of our federal government are using all the funds  available for such purpose, in reclaiming lands of the west by irri-  There   are   1150   Apartment   Houses   in  the  Miami   Area   of  which   This   Is   One  43 		image/tiff						119008425 Bytes	7193	5515	202565789	RGB	8	600	asc99990000050028001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/963	963	964.jp2	/pamphlets/image/964.jp2

It is not the purpose here to discuss the wisdom of such a policy.  It is, rather, to point out that there are thousands and thousands  of farmers of the north who are unable under present conditions  to derive enough per acre or per dollar of investment or per capita  of labor to enable them to enjoy a living standard equal to that of  their city brother of equal ability. At the same time land is being  brought into use that does not excel as farm lands, but instead, is  probably less valuable as farm land than much that has been under  cultivation for years. The operators of the latter farms are in the  same situation as the older farmers except that their situation is  worse.  All of the possible solutions have been offered, it seems, and  today much controversy rages about the head of President Coolidge  because of the farmers' predicament. The most insistent demand  of the organised farmer seems to be for a tariff on imported farm  products.  As to the merits of that proposal we are also unconcerned  except to say that with the intensive cultivation in the offing of  much Florida land of singular productivity, the northern farmer  will find that he has a competitor of tremendous proportions within  his own country.  This is merely the change in our economic life in recent years  transmitting itself to the farm and the farmer. The way it is  taking place is perhaps somewhat as is set forth in the following  paragraph.  While the industrialist has been making unheard-of strides in  increased efficiency and in the application of modern power machinery that have enabled him and his employees to raise the living  standard to the highest in history, the farmer has found that even  the use of the most modern methods will not increase his per capita  or his per acre yield by an extent comparable to the advance made  by the industrialist. The very limitations of season and soil have  been a hedge about him. The rise in price has in a measure compensated him for that difference.  That very rise in price, however, has been the justification  for the efforts made to bring into use the lands of our country on  which, not one crop, but two crops or three crops (and sometimes  more) can be grown per year. It is the movement of the farmer  to place himself by increased production per capita and per acre  per year back on his old footing of economic equality with his  industrial brother.  As to what can be reasonably expected let us ask ourselves this  question?   Why should the northern farmer whose land is not so  44  THE   WORLD'S    MIAMI  located or so fertile as to enable him to compete advantageously  with this new two-, three- and four-crop per year farm land, continue to farm at a loss when the new land is obtainable at prices  as low per acre as the value of his own farm? Is it to be expected  that he will continue to produce beans and potatoes, a good part  of which will have to be sold at a net loss to meet competition?  This does not mean for a moment that northern farms will  suddenly be depopulated. Far from it. But there are thousands  of farms, to which, just that will happen. It may not be that the  farmer himself will make the change. But, his son will and in all  probability, the son whose father is wise and sees the transition  taking place will be encouraged and helped in the change.  By this transition and the rapid increase in our population will  the increased production from Latin America and Florida be absorbed. In the readjustment of the man-power, many of these  northerners seeking a field of greater opportunity will be drawn  into the factories that will increase the production of finished  products to be sold in Latin America and others will be drawn to  the farms of the south.  It would,not be fitting to close a consideration of Miami's foreign trade possibilities without placing at the forefront of her many  assets, the University of Miami. Faced perhaps, with more than  her just share of the trials and problems peculiar to new universities this institution can boast that her leaders are men and women  of indomitable courage, who, with all of their financial difficulties,  have yet been able to vision the Miami of the future and are endeavoring earnestly to mold the University's activities so as to  hasten and enhance Miami's growth in Latin American importance.  That success will crown such indefatigable efforts cannot be doubted  and when the final story is told, this baby University of which  we are so proud will be acclaimed for the great service it will have  rendered to its mother city—Miami.  45 		image/tiff						118123686 Bytes	7193	5474	1895824264	RGB	8	600	asc99990000050029001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/964	964	965.jp2	/pamphlets/image/965.jp2

The  Tamiami Trail, linking the East Coast with the West Coast, straight  across the center of the 'Glades is rapidly nearing completion and  should be opened for travel early in 1928 so that visitors to the  great national conventions of "Shriners" and "Elks" may leave  Miami at their close and cross the world-known Everglades to the  great cities of the West Coast. Work is nearing completion on  deepening the harbor to twenty-five feet and widening it to two  hundred feet to admit the greatest ocean liners, this being but the  first step toward the harbor facilities that are visioned for the future.

From a debtor nation in  1914 to a nation having invested in foreign countries a sum very  near if not equal to the sum invested by Great Britain, has been  the progress of the United States. We are today rapidly approaching Great Britain in respect of total tonnage on the high seas.  Another change of very definite nature and of widespread proportion is the movement southward. Whole industries have moved  from the New England and other states into North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama and so on. Cheap power, lower living  cost, lower taxes and less rigorous seasons—these are factors playing  an important part in that change.  The production of airplanes on a quantity basis is on the way.  In a short time distance will thereby be virtually annihiliated and  Miami will then be but a one night journey in a comfortable bed  from even Canada.  All these mean wealth, prestige, growth, profits—but, these,  alone are not Miami. Rather, Miami is blessed with a civic pride,  a civic consciousness that compel admiration.

Miami, feeling doubly the deflation due to a parallel deflation  in real estate throughout the nation generally, is nevertheless leading "the way back" today—is convincing the world of her stability  and permanence. Our great national insurance companies and  other companies having idle funds seeking investment opportunities,  are, on the same conservative basis as elsewhere, of course, loaning  on Miami mortgages and such money is plentiful.  Miamians are not alone in being solidly sold on Miami. The  Southern Bell Telephone Company has expended hundreds of thousands of dollars on new equipment to handle the expected growth.  Miami's railroads (Florida East Coast and Seaboard Air Line) and  her several steamship companies have equipped themselves to take  care easily of ten times the heaviest traffic yet experienced into  Miami. Richard H. Edmonds, Editor of the "Manufacturer's Record" is author of the statement made in April of this year that  President Warfield of the Seaboard Air Line, ten years ago, said  that he thought Florida was destined to be the richest state in the  Union. Mr. Edmonds also stated at the same time that Alfred  Du Pont of the multi-millionaire family of Wilmington, expressed  the opinion to him that the ten years from 1927 on would see  Florida making greater progress in wealth and population than any  other state in the Union. The Florida Power and Light Company  has spent and is spending millions preparing for development anticipated in the near future.    And so on ad infinitum.  In that connection, this paragraph from the address of Hon.  James M. Cox, delivered at the opening of the Miami-Biltmore  Hotel, January 14, 1926, is apropos.  "Capital is a coy maiden not to be lured by romance or sophistry, and yet hundreds of millions of dollars have come here to  erect the imposing buildings that rise above the palms and break  through the tropical sky-line into a perspective that grips our imagination. The history of corporations like the General Electric  Company does not reveal a time when they have followed like pilgrims of the desert, the alluring appeal of a miasma. Such concerns look before they step and must find positive evidence of  substantial growth as the base of investment. In the face of this,  the General Electric is now supplying funds to take, care of the  demand for light and power on the east coast, a project bringing  into use more than a hundred million dollars."  He further said:  "We hear it said that we have people here but no industry.  48  THE    WORLD'S    MIAMI  So spoke they of Los Angeles for years. A great population means  human necessity and human ingenuity has provided for human  necessity and this provision means industry. The greatest industry  of England is the dry I docks, where the ships of the seas come in  for repairs. Untold thousands of human units are coming to Florida  to find relief in health as the ships of the sea enter the dry docks  of Britain. If Florida, with her almost eternal sunshine, should be  nothing more than the harbor where body and spirit come for  rehabilitation she would be a national asset claiming a people's  pride and gratitude."  C. W. Barron has said "Miami and Miami Beach have made  the greatest comeback and the greatest recovery in the history of  the world. You have now only to read your lessons clearly, build  and rebuild the stronger. Miami is behind Miami Beach, Jacksonville and all Florida are behind Miami, and behind the whole state  is the United States with one-half the income of the world."  "The cheapest city property in the world today is in the cities  of China and India which have the greatest population. . . People  of themselves do not create values. Values are created by the souls  within the people."  What thoughts are brought to us by those words of Roger  W. Babson. Picture the giant crucible in which, amid flying sparks  and burning gases, the baser iron is turned to the finer steel.  Visualise the work of the sandpaper, as with it the skilled  cabinet-maker smooths oak or mahogany.  Impurities cannot survive the crucible process and the steel  remains. Blemishes cannot survive before the sandpaper and a  surface smooth as glass is attained.

Inner progress and advancement are not made by man when  all is serene and worldly comforts and desires are to be obtained  by but a wave of the hand. Thought at such an hour is of material things.  Rather, it is when all is blackness save only for the light of an  abiding faith, a shining vision; it is when there yawns ahead an  open chasm, bridged only by a sustaining hope, a fearless courage,  that man's utter impotence is forced upon his consciousness and  he either then takes flight from his troubles and his responsibilities  or else, he turns for help and guidance to the sound basic principles,  the eternal values, the everlasting realities that are, of necessity, part  and parcel of a full life on this old planet.  The people of Miami today have passed through the "crucible"—have, in recent years, felt the inexorable "sandpaper" of  changing circumstances. They have faced the alternative of  "flight" or the embracing of the real spiritual values and they have  chosen the latter. Something from within or something from  without supplied that faith and vision, hope and courage necessary  to sustain them.  To name or describe just what that something has been is perhaps beyond our powers but Dr. A. Edwin Keigwin, pastor of the  West End Presbyterian Church in New York City, in writing "It is  surprising how many long-time church members look to Florida  as the promised land of life's pilgrimage" stated in the same letter  that he gathers the same enthusiasm and ardor from the letters of  his friends in Miami today as was contained in the letters of his  revered uncle, Dr. Henry Keigwin, the first Presbyterian missionary  in the Miami area.  However this may all be, the Miamian of today is molded from  the clay of the Community Builder. He is the type that is thinking,  planning, getting ready for the times ahead that his insight, vision  and courage tell him are bound to come. As Miami has drawn  and held her people from every state in the Union, so it is doubtful  if another city in the country can boast of a personnel of higher  caliber. And, the Miamians are determined that, forevermore those  gifts that one woman devoutly termed "simply a benediction" shall  be broadcast about Miami to the World.  This means that again Miami is in need of man-power, real manpower—elderly men, middle-aged men and young men and it is to  the latter, the "youth" particularly that the most marvelous opportunities call.    Let youth but come and see and hear and the chal-  50  THE   WORLD'S    MIAMI  lenge to mind and soul and heart will draw him into a fray from  which Miami—and he—will emerge at the pinnacle of success.  And, so, you have this exposition of Miami's civic attainments,  this incomplete economic survey of a great city. Since 1890 it  has been much as though a handful of millionaires found themselves suddenly in a land of exquisite delight and were so carried  away as to determine that their fortunes and their energies should  be dedicated to the task of matching nature with the finest work  of man to make those delights a source of health, happiness, prosperity and pleasure to mankind.  Years ago, with much that motive, it was a pioneer of Miami  Beach who visioned the Dixie Highway and it was he who was the  moving spirit in putting through the roads that in linking Florida  and the North, opened the way for progress in the South.  Flowers all the year; mellow, gentle breezes; moonlight and  starry night winning as only tropical skies can win you; gentle  waters of Biscayne Bay or roaring surf of the Atlantic inviting you  on Christmas day; commerce, industry, agriculture, wealth—the  time is not far distant when that larger handful from all over  One of Miami's Fine Churches  51 		image/tiff						119252730 Bytes	7234	5495	3780613123	RGB	8	600	asc99990000050032001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/967	967	968.jp2	/pamphlets/image/968.jp2

No longer will  you be skeptical as to the truth of the wonderful  Arabian Nights fairy tales, which once so delighted  our juvenile fancy, and especially the story of "Aladdin  and his Wonderful Lamp." For was not Mr. Henry  M. Flagler the Aladdin of the east coast of Florida? He struck  his lamp, and a thousand genii arose to do his bidding; the south  Florida wilderness was connected with the outside world with  bands of steel; there arose a chain of beautiful tourist hotels,  which were destined to attract people of wealth, who came, saw,  and were captivated by the lure of the seductive charms of the  white beaches, the blue waters with their background of perpetual  green, the foam-crested waves, the invigorating breezes with  breath of salt, waving fronds of cocoanut palm, through which  sift almost perpetual sunbeams, tangled jungle of sea grape and  mangrove, rocky clefts in which vegetation burrows for a foothold, a summer air that never depresses, a winter air that  invigorates but never destroys.

From the crests of the gently undulating landscape  are caught vistas of dazzling concrete homes, with brilliant red-  tiled roofs; well-kept lawns bordered by flowering shrubs and  foliage plants of variegated hue,—the palm, the hibiscus, the  red poinsettia, and the royal poinciana, the most beautiful tree  in all this wonderful Southland. For the most part of the year  its dark green leaves, which look like gigantic ferns, spread out  in umbrella fashion. The spring comes, and, as in the North it  tempts forth the saucy crocus and the modest violet, here it  quickens the sap in the poinciana tree and turns it to fire. Yes,  to fire, for the tree bursts into a very flame with its riot of red  bloom. It is the red of the crest of the furnace; the red of the  sea-coal fire; the red of the pine-knot ember. "Flame Tree," the  simple folk call it; "Royal Poinciana," say the educated. But  it is burning beauty, and here one may feast his eyes until he  must turn away.

The tax  levy for 1915 is 12 mills.  During 1914 an average of a mile of concrete sidewalk a  month was laid, and this remarkable record is still being maintained. The "Concrete Age" calls Miami the "Concrete City,"  and says: "The world's greatest per capita consumption of  cement has been at Miami, Florida, for the last three years."  In the business section everything recent is of reinforced  concrete, while in the residential district one sees miles of bungalows, cottages, and palatial residences all built of this permanent  material, and the impression of strength and solidity thereby  produced goes a long way toward giving the new-comer a favorable  opinion of this city.  The business section is paved with wood blocks, and the residential district with asphalt. At one time, recently, petitions  were filed by property-owners, asking for 391 blocks of additional  paving.

When  one takes into consideration the fact that all street paving is paid  for by the abutting property-owners, one begins to comprehend  the "Miami Spirit," and why Miami is called the "Magic City."  Since the war started, Miami's building operations have shown  an increase of 43 per cent. Post-office receipts for the past fiscal  year show a gain of over 16 per cent. The 1914 bank clearings  for Miami show an increase of approximately 20 per cent over  those for the previous year, this being probably the greatest  increase in the South for 1914.  MUNICIPAL  IMPROVEMENTS  The municipal improvements laid out for Miami during 1914  amounted to over $500,000.   Some of these have been completed  and some are still under way.  During 1914 buildings were erected  in Miami and vicinity, costing $1,200,000; projects under way  at the beginning of 1915,  not including a multitude  of  lesser   residences   and  dwellings, footed up to  $1,630,000; development  projects, $1,470,000.

Whenever the biting  blizzards sweep over the North and West, leaving suffering,  destruction, and death in their trail, were the preeminent advantages of Miami generally understood throughout the entire  country, thousands of people would seek this favored section,  either for a permanent or a winter home. Tropical luxuriance of  plants and shrubbery, which appeal mightily to everyone, is on  every side.

IDEAL SUMMER  CLIMATE  In the upbuilding of  Miami, the most difficult  task has been to convince  the home-seeker that the  summer climate is desirable. Because the temperature during the winter months ranges  from 50 degrees up to 80, non-residents conclude that the heat  during the summer months must be in proportion. Only those  who come to Miami during the summer-time seem to be actually  convinced that the climate is ideal the year round. In vain will  you seek to find a Miamian,—man, woman or child,—who will  not say, if he has ever lived in the North or West, that the  summer climate of this city is infinitely preferable to that of  his former home. If human evidence counts for anything, the  statement must be accepted, for the testimony is overwhelming,  with nothing on the other side. These people, of course, all admit  without question that the summer season is longer, and that the  days are warm and, indeed, sometimes hot. Nevertheless, it is  true that the thermometer rarely rises as high in Miami as in  the North and West, and never so high as the extremes of temperature in other sections. It is upon the freedom from sunstrokes in the daytime  and the cool and refreshing summer nights  that particular stress is  constantly laid.  Interior of Post Office showing lock-boxes  Really, after a visit to Miami,  I am unsettled for a month. I  see so much of beauty, so much  progress, so much that is desirable that I feel that I would  like to be settled in the midst  of people that are doing things,  and amid the tropical surroundings that make Miami  famous.—Edgar A.

In the fall of 1912, the property, in acreage, was purchased  by Mr. Frederic H. Rand, Jr., who organized the Miramar Company for the purpose of its development. The tract was subdivided  into lots, wide streets and beautiful parks were laid out, and the  most complete improvements installed throughout.  Naturally a beautiful location, situated between Biscayne  Drive, the main street running north and south in the City of  Miami, and Biscayne Bay, Miramar has been readily recognized as an ideal home-site, and its improvements made in keeping  with the highest class of residential sections.

An attractive feature of Miramar is the underground Electric  Light and Telephone system, thus dispensing with unsightly poles  and overhead wires throughout the property. At this date some  twenty beautiful residences have been built, by well-pleased purchasers of lots, of which the two below shown are typical. Handsome shade trees, an abundance of multicolored tropical shrubbery,  lawns of velvet, and beautiful flower-beds, show that Nature,  realizing its possibilities, has done her part in aiding the work,  and it is safe to assume that no portion of the city will, within  the next few years, grow more rapidly than Miramar,  Type of Residence in Miramar  THIRTEEN  ?mmi'mmm?mmm&lt;ymmyy¥M????Mmimm  ff  lit"  1A  ;-*!a§.?a:^  ^;fta:ftAaa.fta::aaapg-a^  "A'/-'" ' . .     ft        ;"     ft     ;.   :-ft -m  ftiftlAAAAAlAAA^^  mm®;m&0£Mmkwmmimm. 		image/tiff						87708534 Bytes	4566	6403	3841021285	RGB	8	600	asc99990000370012001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/982	982	983.jp2	/pamphlets/image/983.jp2

The Southern Business College is a prosperous  institution, whose aim is to fit the young women and the young  men of the community for efficient service along commercial  lines.

Mr. H. M.  Leonard, of Detroit, Michigan, in praising Miami, said:  "Miami possesses a combination of four things which  make it superior to any other  place in Florida. These are  good fishing, fine climate, excellent business houses, and  splendid hotels."  The Bakery and Cafe of  Mr. John Seybold is known  far and wide for its excellence  and service. Everywhere one  is impressed with the sense of  sanitary cleanliness. Here, sitting among the palms and ferns,  one may enjoy his coffee and rolls, dainty luncheon, delicious  creams and sodas. The enticing aroma of freshly made candies  is irresistible to the lover of sweets.  In the bakery department, those contemplating doing light  housekeeping, or taking furnished rooms, will find everything to  meet their requirements.  Mr. Seybold, in addition to his large retail store, conducts a  wholesale business covering the entire east coast. An inspection  of this beautiful store elicits surprise and wonder on the part  of all visitors.  The bakery and confectionery line in Miami certainly seems  to be well supplied for years to come.

The   Southern   Bank   and   Trust  Company was organized January 13,  1912.   The capital stock is $100,000.  This bank is referred to as "Trust  Company Number One," from the  fact that it was the first bank and  trust company to organize under the  state laws of Florida governing such  institutions. All funds arising under  this form of business are kept separate  and apart from bank funds, and are  not liable for the bank's obligations  in the ordinary course of business.  The Safety Deposit Department is  fully equipped with the  best up-to-  date steel vault and safety-deposit boxes.  The officers are: J. E. Lummus, President; F. S. Morse, Vice-  President; T. E. James, Secretary and Treasurer; H. H. Filer,  Assistant Secretary and Treasurer. .  BANK  OF BAY  BISCAYNE  Just the age of Miami is the Bank of Bay Biscayne. Incorporated in 1896, its capital stock then was $25,000, and it occupied  a little one-story building. The present building is one of the most  artistically arranged financial institutions in the entire country.  This bank is one of the few banks on the roll of honor, with  surplus equal to its capital. It is the second largest bank in the state.  In 1896 the capital of the bank was $25,000; deposits ran from  $75,000 to $90,000.  Contrasted with these figures, the capital now  is $100,000, the deposits about $1,500,000, and the surplus and  undivided profits $125,000.  Miami is justly proud to  have  within  its  business  circles such an institution  as this is.  The officers of the  Bank of Bay Biscayne are:  J. E. Lummus, President;  S. A.

Primarily a Building and  Loan Association, it has  helped to build more than a  thousand homes in this city.  It is first o&gt;n the honor roll of  similar institutions in Florida.  In fifteen years it has never  failed to pay regular quarterly dividends. These quarterly dividends now amount  to nearly ten thousand dollars each quarter. It has  no preferred stock, all shareholders being* on an equal  basis.  Its resources are considerably  above the half-million-  dollar mark, and  show a steady increase.  "The money of an investor, distributed on a number of properties, is much safer than if he had himself loaned it on a single  piece of property, and as these loans average small, less than  $1,000, they usually make better security than if larger, as it  is easier for ten men to make monthly payments of $18.30  each than it would be for one man to make a payment of  $183. The security is better, and the risk is less,'other things  being equal."  To the man of modest means, desirous of building a home, we  can recommend the Dade County Security Company. Its  method of loaning money for this purpose, to be returned in  small monthly payments, like rent, enables one to own his own  home in a few years.  The last session of the legislature of Florida passed a law  which puts building and loan companies under the supervision  of the Comptroller of the state.

The  South Fork of the Miami River  passes through Riverside Farms.  &  liiili ft  I 		image/tiff						87948744 Bytes	4536	6463	2957751808	RGB	8	600	asc99990000370022001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/992	992	993.jp2	/pamphlets/image/993.jp2

Here are shell-encrusted rocks, sponges, exotic sea-  forms, fishes—red, green, gold, rainbow-hued—zigzagging leisurely among the waving foliage; here are real trees with long  branches, waving as on land in a tempest.

Waddell  is known as one of the  real builders of Miami, for  he was the second person  to settle on the present  town-site. His residence  here dates from 1894,when  the remnants of old Fort  Dallas and the trading post on BrickeU's Point furnished  the only signs of human occupation. Before Miami began  to assume proportions, Colonel Waddell insisted on predicting  the founding of a city, and when the start was really made, he  was among the foremost who talked, wrote, dreamed, and advocated Miami on all sides.  At present Colonel Waddell is extensively engaged in the real-  estate business, in the Waddell Block on Avenue D, where there  is always an abundance of literature concerning the advantages  of this section, exhibits of fruits and vegetables, and where a  general information bureau is maintained.  In addition, he is Vice-President of the First National Bank,  a director and stockholder in the Miami Savings Bank and  Bank of Bay Biscayne.

Formerly the private  estate of Walter E. Flanders, of Detroit, Michigan, whose fame  as an automobile manufacturer is world-wide, it has been converted into the exclusive and highly restricted district known as  Magnolia Park.  For several years Mr. Flanders has made his winter home in  Miami, and it was only a short time ago he reluctantly consented  to the division of his estate and sharing it with others.  Under the personal direction of Mr. George S. Reid, of  Miami, this already handsome place has, in the past few months,  been transformed into a residential section so beautiful in its  surroundings as to invite the comparison of any other place in  all this land of sunshine and flowers.  No expense has been spared to make Magnolia Park the most  desirable place in Miami in which to reside, and already eight  handsome residences are being erected. A complete high-pressure  water-system has been installed, thus insuring a plentiful supply  of the purest water at all times.  E  I have seen the principal cities of the  United States, but for many years have  spent my winters in Miami.-Jvo. F. Robinson, Robinson's World-FamShows!

The streets are extremely wide, and are paved  and curbed.  Between the street curb and the cement sidewalk a wide  space has been set aside as a park, in which Washingtonia palms  and hibiscus have been placed. No more highly restricted residence district is to be found in all the South. Only one single  residence and a garage may be built on a single lot, and builders  are required to submit all plans for residences to the supervising  architect for approval before a house may be erected, which  must be placed on the spot indicated on the lot by the architect.  This is required in order that all residences in Magnolia Park  may be in harmony with each other, and to insure a strictly high-  class residential district, free from the unsightly houses so often  found in unrestricted districts.  For the convenience of the residents in Magnolia Park who  have yachts and small boats, a handsome concrete pier is soon to  be erected. The boating and fishing in this part of Biscayne Bay  are most ideal, the tarpon fishing-grounds being directly opposite  this property.  / have never seen anything like it; most cities would be glad to show in ten years  what Miami has to show in two years' growth.—H.

This beautiful  tract of eighty acres adjoins the city limits on the west, and is  directly in the path of Miami's rapid march of progress, which is  to the westward. Twelfth Street, the main artery of travel,  extends through Glen Royal.  Here upon an elevation, whose gentle, undulating slope commands an unsurpassed view of the city, it is proposed to lay out  a truly "royal" residence section. Mr. A. H. Brigham, its founder,  has recently spent six months in traveling over the country,  gathering ideas which will be used in this exclusive subdivision.  The extensiveness of the tract makes it possible to lay it  out along broad and modern lines. To provide rest and recreation as well as beautiful home-sites, there will be miles of  handsome drives, shaded walks, tennis-courts, parks, and  a swimming-pool for the use of those who may be so fortunate  as to own a winter or permanent home in Glen Royal. Nearly  five acres have been reserved in the center of the tract, to  be devoted to rest and recreation. It is proposed to omit no  detail which will give to Glen Royal that fullness of beauty  and arrangement, and that freedom from annoyances, which  no other location can offer.  An unfailing supply of pure, sparkling water gives opportunity for the cultivation not only of citrus fruits, but of the  tropical and semi-tropical trees and plants as well. Here Nature  has been most generous in providing all the environments which  will make the "Glen Royal" a royal place indeed.  thirty-three  Slftl    AA'! "     -.'

People who  have made their wealth elsewhere are seeking Miami in ever-  increasing numbers for either a winter or  a permanent home.  OPPORTUNITIES  If you have money to invest, judicious investments in  business property, in high-class residence subdivisions, or agricultural or citrus lands at prevailing prices, are safe and certain  to bring large returns in the near future. Good interest is paid  for money on real-estate loans, 8 per cent being readily obtained.  The development of citrus-groves and trucking lands affords good  inducement to capital. For climatic reasons, Miami will always  be a resort city, and the building of modern apartment houses  and hotels will be profitable. Attractive, medium-priced bungalows for persons of moderate means are readily salable. Miami's  building and loan associations offer safe and highly remunerative  investments, paying regular dividends.

Dr. C. J. Ericson, proprietor, came to Miami in 1900. In  1905 he was made President of the Palm Pharmacy, which was  at that time small and by no means modern. By the employment  of progressive methods, he soon made the Palm Pharmacy one  of the most popular and prosperous drug stores in the city. In  1910 he purchased the entire interest in the business. He has  since acquired the Biscayne Pharmacy, which he has recently  remodeled and renovated. At either store you will find complete  lines of Rexall and Nyal specialties. Here you will find the  service accurate, and the clerks courteous and obliging.  BOATING TRIPS  In addition to the ferry-boats, which make hourly trips to  Miami Beach across the bay, there are regular trips during the  tourist season to Soldier Key, ten miles southeast of Miami.

Many pleasant hours can be spent among the Florida Keys,  some fifty in number, which stretch along the coast like a great  string of natural pearls.

These associations act as a clearing-house  for the advancement of things progressive. They represent the  spirit of progress, and their membership embraces men who are  identified with every legitimate line of business and profession,  who stand ready to lend their aid and encouragement to all  projects which tend to the promotion of the city's welfare.  AUTOMOBILE TRIPS  Connecting with the "Dixie Highway," 300 miles of paved  roads radiate from Miami; roads, level as a floor and smooth as  asphalt, many miles of "which it is possible to cover at a  speed of fifty miles an hour, with a glass of water in the outstretched hand, and never spill a drop of it," wend their way  through the most enchanting scenery, frequently through groves  of grapefruit, pineapples, and other semi-tropical fruit and shade  trees. It is estimated that the completion of the* Dixie Highway  will bring 10,000 automobiles to Miami each year. It may be  well to say here, however, that colored chauffeurs are decidedly  unpopular in Miami, as most of the local garages unite in refusing  to give service to automobiles driven by colored chauffeurs.  Sight-seeing cars make daily trips during the tourist season,  covering the surrounding country. These trips through the  grapefruit groves and the winter gardens of the United States,  where one may see hundreds of acres of vegetables growing, and  being prepared in  the packing-houses for shipment north, are  very interesting,  and will give the  tourist a better idea  of Florida's possibilities than almost anything else. 		image/tiff						86267859 Bytes	4491	6403	2120727194	RGB	8	600	asc99990000370037001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1007	1007	1008.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1008.jp2

There  are 700 known varieties of fish in  Florida waters, or  about one-fifth of  the entire fauna of  America, north of  Panama.  Trolling   for  kingfish, jack, bluefish, Spanish mackerel, and spotted sea trout  furnishes sport of the most exciting kind; while that rarest of all  sport, tarpon fishing, is a feature, and attracts fishermen from  all over the world. Still-fishing from the "Collins" Bridge, which  extends for two and one-half miles across Biscayne Bay, furnishes  sufficient variety to please any angler who prefers that kind of  sport.  ACCOMMODATIONS FOR TOURISTS  Miami is one of the most favorably known resort cities in  Florida or, indeed, throughout the South, for her splendid  %ccommodations.  Twenty-five modern hotels and apartment houses furnish  ample accommodations for the most exacting requirements, while  hundreds of excellent rooming and boarding-houses, belonging  to private families, are open to those of more modest means, or  who desire more privacy.  mam  mSm  a-:      .

Thus it was on September 16, 1926.  From the haunted caverns of the Southern Seas  the hurricane crept upon the loveliest homes this nation knows and dealt a blow so murderous that  when daylight dawned Miami, stunned and bleeding, was struggling to her knees, only to meet a yet  more deadly blow and again to rise and compel the  admiration of the world by the fortitude with  which she began to bind up her children's wounds.  Some there were whose wounds would nevermore  need binding. That day "her house was left unto  her desolate/'  Swiftly the men and women who had made the  city began to mend it. But, long before the vast-  ness of the horror had been fully revealed before  their eyes, they knew that just to hold out until  help might reach them would tax the uttermost  measure of their strength.  Before the waters of disaster had begun to subside, help was on its way. The Red Cross, "Mother  of the World," had matched the hurricane for speed  and the strong arm of that organization, mighty to  save, was bared to rescue and sustain the stricken  city.  Community ties are strong: there were those willing to accept help from comrades of happier days,  who shrank from the idea of an alien almoner.  Here is the crowning miracle of grace. As the  Mother of the World summoned the hungry and  naked, the weary and heavy-laden to the table she  had spread before them, with lagging feet they entered in and, lifting downcast eyes, behold! it was  into the familiar faces of time-tried friends and  neighbors that they gazed.  More than power, more than money, more than  organization, is the tender consideration which has  provided that the hand extended to the stricken  neighbor shall be a hand that has been clasped many  a time before.  Miami, with the arm of the Mother of the World  about her, feels with returning strength the certainty  that this above all will be remembered in the days to  come. When the voice of the Red Cross shall summon us to join in aiding dire need elsewhere, our response will be quickened by the recollection of this  gracious, kindly administration.  Miami, at the feet of the Mother of the World  today; at her service tomorrow. 		image/tiff						71112390 Bytes	5550	4271	4071624737	RGB	8	600	asc99990000160003001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1012	1012	1013.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1013.jp2

Mr. Merrick, who is less than forty years old, has  created a city of tiles, concrete, steel and coral rock out  of what a few years ago was his fathers orange grove.  This is Coral Gables, near Miami. What was an agricultural property a little more than a decade ago is today  a varied landscape of lawns and gardens, broken by the  white and red of fine residences in the Spanish and  Moorish style.  C   Orange Grove's Transformation  Mr. Merrick was in New York City studying law  and practicing poetry when his father died in 191 L  He returned to Miami, which was then a city of about  10,000 inhabitants. The idea occurred to him of turning the grove, which his father called Coral Gables, into  a suburb of Miami. As the development began to prosper he called in artists, landscape architects and city  planners and they built up a modernized Mediterranean  city, in connection with which he and Mr. Bowman are  now building the $10,000,000 hotel, country club and  bathing casino,    lb H %  "Just how I came to utilize the Spanish type of architecture in Coral Gables, I can hardly say, except that  it always seemed to me to be the only way houses should  be built down there in those tropical surroundings,"  mm 		image/tiff						56838012 Bytes	3606	5254	3650428905	RGB	8	600	asc99990000030004001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1082	1082	1083.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1083.jp2

Bryan Employed as Orator  Mr. Merrick has played an important part in the  building of Miami, and his enthusiasm about the place  is such that he believes that to sing its praises adequately  is a task not unworthy of the powers of the greatest  natural orator living.

Mer-  /~y /J rick of Miami, owner of the largest grapefruit and  W    # avocado groves in Southern Florida, began the great  work of building a distinctive Spanish suburb which  would be a worthy expression of the finer sense of the city—a reflex  of the architectural splendor of Old Spain in setting of tropical luxuriance.  Coral Gables as it is today is the result of this great concept.  Its building has attracted country-wide attention both by reason  of the extraordinary scope of the improvements and of the consummate artistry of the work. It is a city of distinction, character  and beauty, which compels the admiration of every one who sees it.  Briefly, in word and picture, the story of Coral Gables is told in  these pages. Not the complete story, perhaps, for even in the time  which the making of a book requires, Coral Gables grows apace and  new beauty is revealed daily. The work of yesterday is before you.  That of today and tomorrow adds to, rounds out and perfects all  that has before been accomplished; and Coral Gables grows constantly in beauty and grandeur, each day marking new advancement towards its goal and destiny—America's Finest Suburban City  and Miami Riviera.

The two great en  trances already completed, and the third, now under  construction, are among the finest examples of Spanish architecture in this country. They were designed by Mr. Denman Fink, an  artist of national distinction, who has made long and painstaking  study   of the   architecture   of   the   grand   old   cities   of   Madrid,  Cordova, Salamanca, Toledo and Seville for  this especial purpose, and has brought to  his work here the best which Hispano-Moorish  art can bestow, as well as the spirit and  charm of the originals.  The Granada Entrance at Granada Boulevard and Southwest Eighth Street is over  three hundred feet long, with a beautiful  arched gateway forty feet high, and, pergolas,  fountains, rest seats, arches, and cloister walls  on either side. Its dignified beauty has been  enriched by full grown palms and tropical  shrubs and vines of the rarest kind.

Its fine double  gateway is 160 feet long and the cloister wall extends for  over six hundred feet in graceful symmetry to form delightful minor  entrances for other avenues in the Business Section. This is the gateway to the Business Section and also the shortest route from Miami  to the southern part of the property.  Mr. Fink is now directing the construction of the third great  entrance on S. W. Eighth street where the  Country Club Prado begins. Others will be  built within a few months at the corner of  Douglas Road and S. W. Eighth street, and  at Flagler street, and Ponce de Leon Boulevard. The last is located on Miami's principal  business street. The Gladeside Entrance at  Coral Way and Red Road, and the Coconut  Grove Entrance on Bird Road—-making a  grand total of seven entrance gateways—will  complete this remarkable feature of the Great  Development Program.

The same great advantages are  sound assets today for those who appreciate their importance in  better living.  Coral Gables with the large additions of  property which have been made during the  past year, covers approximately sixteen square  miles, or 10,000 acres. A large part of this has  been developed for over twenty-five years as  grapefruit, orange and avocado groves. Development in town planning on a scale which  had never before been attempted in this country began in 1921, and the first offering of  building plots was made in that year. The  magnificently matured suburb which visitors  see today is therefore only a little more than  four years old.

The Prado is  * about one and one-half miles in length and  200  feet  wide, with a 100 foot parkway in the center. The  new entrance on S. W. Eighth Street is at the northern end of the  Prado, and the great Miami-Biltmore Hotel and Sports Center at its  southern end. Planting on an extraordinary scale has beautified  this fine avenue to a degree which fairly earns for it its rank among  the finest residential streets of this country. All of these fine boulevards, and practically all of the streets in the  suburb, are built of crushed coral stone, hardened and asphalted. A short motor trip to  Coral Gables with its magnificent fruit groves  and parks, its entrances and plazas, and its  hundreds of Spanish homes, is among the best  tours which the city affords, and one which  homefolks and visitors heartily enjoy.  Eighty miles of cement sidewalks have  also been built at Coral Gables. In the Business Section the walks are ten feet wide; in all  residential sections five or four feet wide.

Great things of national and international scope are already assured this  unit of Coral Gables.    They include the Fifteen Million Dollar University of  Miami, which is destined to become the educational  and cultural center of the South and has attracted  great interest in Latin-America as well; an Eight  Million Dollar Sanitarium; Million Dollar University  High School, of which three units are now building; a  Three Million Dollar Recreational and Sports Center  of Mahi Temple Shrine, where Shriners from everywhere will find Southern hospitality in fuller flower.  These in addition to the Miami-Biltmore Casino  mentioned  on  another  page.  Twelve Bay Islands will be built in Biscayne  Bay, all joined and made integral units in the Miami  Riviera by bridges of highest artistry.

Merrick  Planting on a Magnificent Scale  J  LORIDA'S flora is the richest and most varied of any  State in the Union, the wealth and charm of whose  beauty is best exemplified by the magnificent tropical  foliage of the Miami district. In the beautification of  Coral Gables this fact has been taken advantage of in  a really remarkable way. The plan was adopted to make the  suburb as superior in the beauty of its trees and flowers as it is  distinctive in its entrances and plazas, its fine Spanish homes and  buildings.     This plan has been carried out with such wonderful  results that the planting program of Coral  Gables has become one of its most brilliant  achievements.  During the four years of development  work, more than 100,000 trees, shrubs, and  flowering plants of the rarest varieties were  set out. Entire avenues and boulevards  were planted in eucalyptus, pithecolobium,  royal poinciana, rubber, coconut, royal and  other palms. The work was done under the  ll direction of the ablest landscape architects  and gardeners in this country.

There are numerous apartment houses  offering their comforts to visitors as well as  residents. These fine hostelries do more  than offer mere living quarters—they embody old world charm in a delightfully full  measure.

More than two thousand of these trees, thirty to  forty feet high, purchased at great cost and with almost  infinite labor, have been taken from every part of the Miami district  and transplanted at Coral Gables.   These fine large trees supplement  in a notable way the planting of several thousand smaller coconuts  during the first year.    They add immensely to the beauty of .entrances and plazas, parkways and golf courses, and provide ideal settings for Coral Gables' beautiful homes.  The great planting program has steadily  increased in proportions during the past year.  This was inevitable because all phases of  activity in the suburb have increased tremendously this summer, and besides the open-  1J ing up of new streets and residential sections,  the planting of former seasons must be cared  for, The splendid nursery at Coral Gables  contains more than 100,000 plants which are  carefully nurtured until ready for planting in  other parts of the suburb,  Page thirty 		image/tiff						81631104 Bytes	4508	6036	2544504279	RGB	8	600	asc99990000010031001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1126	1126	1127.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1127.jp2

Williams  Advantages of Spanish Architecture  &TL   J   UCH of the beauty of these delightful Coral Gables homes  /1/f     is found in the rare fidelity to Spanish style in which  I   i   V^ they  have  been  rendered  by  Miami's  best  architects.  Much of it is found in their luxurious and harmonious  settings.    Much of it is due'to the native coral stone of which so  many are built.    But the result of all combined certainly has given  to Coral Gables an assemblage of homes which for uniform quality,  attractiveness and permanence cannot be surpassed.  In history and tradition, climate and foliage, Florida is more closely allied with Spain  than with any other country, and Spanish  architecture rightfully belongs here. Not only  does it harmonize better with tropical skies  and trees, but it adds material comfort to  home life. Spacious loggias and patios, large  living rooms, open sleeping rooms, tiled  porches and terraces are inseparable with home  life here. Our architects have incorporated  them in Coral Gables homes of the most pleasing Spanish type, and the fine old Spanish tile  roofs add a final note of distinction.

This is  quite as it should be.    Coral Gables is first and last a  distinctive residential suburb.    All that has been accomplished in  the way of magnificent beautifying improvements has been done  to make it more desirable for home-builders,  and to surround these homes with all of  the advantages and refinements of better  living.  The building of three hundred homes was  an important feature of this year's great Development Program. With what care the  work was planned, and with what consummate  skill it was accomplished is best of all evidenced in the distinctive quality and superb  beauty of the homes themselves. The visitor  to Coral Gables can see these in every section  of the suburb, and may study them with both  pleasure and profit.

These will be  found to cover not only the minimum cost of houses, but  building lines as well. On many of the principal avenues  it is necessary to own more than one lot in order to build. All houses  must be constructed of coral rock or stucco.  These restrictions have made possible the broad lawns and extensive planting, attractive garages and driveways, breathing spaces  for children, and garden plots for home-grown vegetables and fruit.  They insure also a high standard of building,  which can never be secured without restrictions.  At the same time there is nothing in Coral  Gables' restrictions which will prevent the  building of a modest home, providing it is of  stucco. There are streets in large numbers  where cost restrictions are as low as $4,000.  But the man who desires a $10,000 or $25,000  home will naturally select a street where restrictions are higher, and where he is assured  that similar homes will always be built.

Schools affording every  phase of study from kindergarten work through University Courses,  are included in the educational facilities.  Two fine grammar schools, University High School soon to open, Coral  Gables Military Academy, the splendid College and Boarding School for Girls,  owned and conducted by that eminent teaching body, the Sisters of' St. Joseph-  all of these combine to offer educational opportunities covering a broad field.  In addition, the great University of Miami will open the doors of its first  three   units in 1926.,   This institution is endowed for  $15,000,000 and is destined  to  become the cultural  center of  the entire South, having the guidance of  some of the foremost educators in America.  Indeed, there is much to enrich the dignity of  home life and community spirit everywhere in  Coral Gables. One of the leading influences is the  Congregational Church of Coral Gables, of which  Rev.

Elaborate plans for other building projects in  the business group are under way.   The coming year promises developments to exceed, by  a wide margin, the wonders that have already  m  been accomplished.    A program of such vast  11" proportions as to render an unlimited estimate  \   of expenditure—in fact a program greater than  has ever  before  been  known  in Florida—is  being carefully launched.

Alhambra  Plaza, extending from Lejeune Road to Douglas Road, is  140 feet wide, with ten foot sidewalks on either side, and  a beautiful parkway in the center of the plaza. Alhambra  Circle, branching from Alhambra Plaza to the magnificent Bayside  Entrance on Douglas Road is 120 feet wide, and Avenue Alameda  is 100 feet wide.  The Business Section, while it is the only  part of the property in which business buildings may be erected, is not restricted exclusively to. commercial structures. A considerable part of it is devoted to residential areas,  and already a large number of fine Spanish  houses have been built here.  Thus the Business Section splendidly  keeps pace with the remarkable growth and  development of Coral Gables, growing every  day in usefulness, power and attractiveness,  even as Miami's Master Suburb daily acquires  greater beauty and distinction.

However, it is not  only as a resort that the place has gained fame, for business journals far and wide devote much  space to it, and to investors and capitalists Florida means "Miami." Peopled with happy, prosperous and contented men and women; throbbing with commercialism, progressiveness and  prosperity; cosmopolitan, non-sectarian and highly American, Miami opens wide her portals that  all may enter and enjoy the wonders that nature has bestowed upon a city of flowers, blooming  shrubs and trees, radiant foliage and waving palms found in no other part of the United States.  In her progress she has defied the sea on the East and the Everglades on the West, for in Biscayne  Bay islands spring into shape almost over night as if by magic, and where the Seminole and  alligator held dominion in limitless stretches of open glades, one now finds canals, streets and  highways thrusting forth their arms to claim the once impenetrable land.  The modern and rapid means of transportation have so  lessened the time for one to leave the snow and blizzards of  the North and reach "The Land of Palms and Sunshine"  that Miami is now reckoned a necessary item in the traveling budgets of Northern people. Overworked brains and  shattered nerves find almost instant relief, as a chance for  indulgence every day in the year in surf-bathing, golf, tennis,  polo, fishing, motoring and all forms of outdoor recreation  makes life satisfying and enjoyable, invigorates and builds  up the system and restores the jaded appetite.  With organized development of its marvelous resources,  Miami, the acknowledged Magic City of Florida, is in this  good year easily ranked as more than excellent in its facilities for meeting the varied needs, desires and even caprices  of those who travel, as well as affording a most desirable  permanent anchorage for those who, in increasing numbers,  are making their homes in this metropolis of the subtropics.  Time was, and not many years ago, when travel to Miami  from other states was beset with difficulties which made it  almost outside the range of possibilities.

Conditions now are changed.  With the incessant efforts of the Dixie Highway Association in promoting highway construction, backed ably at this  terminus of the highway by the Miami Chamber of Commerce, the Motor Club and other organized interests, motor-  vehicle journeying to Miami from any part of the United  States is the opposite of tiresome and tedious. It has become  an outing to be desired to cross the continent or steer the  car down from such extreme northern sections as Canada,  studying conditions of commerce, manufacturing and agriculture along the way, and finally driving the car into a  Miami garage, in the southernmost section of the United  States where palm trees grow and snowflakes are never seen.  And so with the pleasures of the angler. This outdoor recreation attracts many devotees from the prominent walks  of life—men and women who are in quest of relaxation and  who prefer it battling wits and skill with the monsters of  the deep. Although the Miami Anglers' Club is yet an  infant, it is an ambitious one and fully able to do its part in  the life of Miami. This club has its clubhouses and central  headquarters, stopping places on islands and keys in these  waters, and a fleet of its own boats for the use of members  and their friends.  Not alone in improvement of road facilities and the  means of entertaining those with piscatorial proclivities, but  in numerous other ways Miami has been giving serious attention to the details of adequate entertainment for its visitors,  whether they come in the winter months or drop in to pay  their respects in summer time. Through a veritable labyrinth of opportunities for enjoyment there are organizations  here which extend hospitality to the boy and girl, the young  man and woman, men and matrons of middle age and to  those who are admittedly growing old. Whether it is in a  boat on the ocean or bay, in a car on the highways, on the  links, courts or fields, or in concert or dance room, there is  sufficient variety of entertainment in Miami to meet the  requirements of the pleasure-seeking world. This is true  because Miami is uniquely living a large portion of its life  for others.  City with a  Reputation  Miami has become one of the best-known  cities in the United States, through literature regularly prepared and sent out by  the Chamber of Commerce, the Motor Club, the Anglers'  Club and other organizations and the intelligent cooperation in every public endeavor by the newspapers of the city  which circulate generally through the country. Wherever a  car stops, and the Miami banner is displayed on it, there are  inquiries concerning the Magic City of Florida and assurances that some of the inhabitants of that stopping place  entertain hopes of visiting Miami. This friendly interest is  indicated as well by the immense volume of mail received  here by commercial organizations, business houses and  individuals seeking information about the city and indicating a desire to permanently locate here. Through a correct  reputation Miami has come to be known not only as a resort  for the tourist, but as the one great opportunity for investors,  for in the growth of the city fortunes have been amassed and  foundations for other and larger profits are now being laid.  Miami is just beginning to grow.  POPULATION    -^air estimates&gt; from directory figures and  otherwise, place the permanent population  of Miami at not less than 35,000. The transient population,  during the winter months, varies naturally, but it is safe to  HOME OF  CARL G. FISHER  MIAMI BEACH, MIAMI  RESIDENCE OF  JOHN H. HANAN  MIAMI BEACH  RESIDENCE OF  J. H.

Accurate figures on these items are impossible because of the shifting nature of the winter population and the  fact that no central registry has yet been able to claim to  have obtained complete statistics. From the first of January  and even before, until the last of April, Miami is just one  scene of hustle and bustle after another, with strenuous  business and none the relentless pleasure-seeking in full sway.  Geographical   Miami ??cuPies ^ uniq"e P°sition&gt;  geographically, of being the southernmost city on the mainland of the United States. Immediately  south of the city, however, are several small towns, valuable  business feeders for Miami, such as Cocoanut Grove, principally residential, and Homestead and Florida City. Miami  is the county seat of Dade County. It is in what is designated as the subtropical zone, situated on Biscayne Bay  and the Atlantic Ocean, is protected from all the severities  of winter by its. extreme southern location, yet is not subject  to extreme heat in the summer time. Constant breezes from  the ocean are a stimulant against enervation, and many  residents of the city assert that they prefer their summers  here at home to visits in the more northern states during the  heatel months. The Miami River empties into the bay at  Miami, carrying into the ocean the waters from the Miami  drainage canal and its tributaries and thus assisting in the  reclamation of valuable Everglades lands immediately  adjacent to and west of Miami.  Miami is 366 miles south of Jacksonville, on the main  line of the Florida East Coast Railroad, familiarly known as  the Flagler System. Development of the city received full-  hearted encouragement from that master railway builder,  who saw for this section a great future and had the satisfaction of living through the accomplishment of many of his  projects for modernizing this peninsular section of the state  of Florida.  CLIMATE Claim is made, from weather bureau figures,  that Miami's climate is in a class by itself,  the city having the highest absolute minimum winter temperature in the United States, except Key West, and that its  maximum summer temperature is one of the lowest. Stress  is placed on the equability of the climate. Annual mean  temperature is 75.4 degrees, with the average for the summer  months 81.4 and for the winter 69 degrees. The absolute  maximum is 96 degrees, and there are only an average of  eleven days in the year when the temperature reaches 90 or  above. The average possible amount of sunshine is 61 per  cent and practically all the rainfall is between the months of  May and October. So even is the Miami temperature that  many of the residents and visitors prefer summer clothing  even in the winter months, and it is seldom that a tinge of  severe coolness reaches the city even as a fringe from some  of the severe blizzards of the North in widwinter.  Throughout the winter months thousands of visitors and  residents gather in the open air in the park to enjoy the band  concerts and other attractions, and without discomfort.  Foliage of shrubbery attains its most attractive colors in the  winter, flowers bloom in the greatest profusion and the  atmosphere is laden with invigoration which is transmitted  to all who come within the range of its influence.  u On a greater scale than ever before  . the hotels of Miami are being put  Accommodations   fn snape for the accommodation of  tourists, and reservations are being made early in the season  by those who realize the importance of safety first in such  matters. One of the largest hotels of the city will open for  the first time this season. Others have added rooms to double  their former capacity, and many hundreds of guests will  ENTRANCE GATE TO ESTATE OF  WILLIAM J. MATHESON  HOME OF L. T.

Crossing the Everglades westerly is  the Tamiami Trail, now being constructed and well on toward completion, which will connect the Atlantic at Miami  with the gulf at Tampa, making one of the greatest scenic  automobile highway loops in the world. On the Ingraham  Highway, below Florida City, is the Royal Palm State Park,  a project of the women's clubs, in which are preserved much  of the flora, fauna and bird life of Florida. Nearly all of  the rock roads radiating from Miami are oil-coated, which  relieves them from the glare of the usual roads of the tropics.  It is stated by motorists who have seen America widely that  it is a rare delight in their travels to reach the roads of Dade  County and Miami, where they can travel in perfect comfort.  Air Routes  This Season  Through the air from Indianapolis to  Miami—this is one of the certain projects of the season ahead. Preliminary  arrangements have been made for landing fields at points  between these two cities, and the details were all worked  out during the summer.  Aeroplanes and palatial water craft will also combine,  this season, in the development of some of the Bahama  islands, across the Gulf Stream from Miami, principally the  islands nearest the Florida coast. Aggregations of capital  have these island development projects in hand and it is certain that, during the season to come, the pleasure centers of  the tropics will include Bimini and other resorts, all reached  by way of Miami.  During the world war Miami was the center of three  United States Government Aviation Schools, which, since  peace was declared, have been gradually reduced by the discharge and removal of the men. These schools were the  means of attracting thousands of young men and their friends  and families to Miami. A fair representation of the boys in  uniform will doubtless be in Miami during the coming season, and their presence will add much to the social life of  the city.  Miami was also, during the year and is now, a base for  submarine patrol boats, which added to the warlike aspect  of the port.  The Game of Golf  Two solf courses&gt; one at Miami  Beach and the other in the city,  cater to a sport which has devotees by myriads, thousands of  whom come to Florida because of the recreational advantages in summer time. The Miami Beach course is 6,088  yards, with bogey 81 and par 75. Bermuda grass covers the  putting greens, and an attractive clubhouse, constructed in  keeping with the tropical surroundings, serves as an extra  accommodation for players and guests. The course in the  city will accommodate many players from the city hotels,  and both courses will always be in demand.  TENNIS Tennis is one of the most popular winter sports  in this sunny Southland where the pastime may  be indulged in every day in the year. The city of Miami,  the principal hotels and many private courts provide ample  facilities for those who find tennis a pleasure.  The Polo Field  Through the efforts of Carl G.  Fisher, of Indianapolis and Miami,  energetic promoter of everything Miamian and particularly  the Miami Beach section, a polo field was located at Alton  Beach last year and used then for the first matches with  gratifying success. Experts who are familiar with such fields  state that the Alton Beach field is as well adapted to the  game as any in the country, and much better equipped than  any in the South. This addition to the out-of-doors attractions of the beach directly in front of Miami will draw  continually increasing numbers who appreciate the fact that  MIAMI'S NEW Y. H. C. A.

BlSCAYNE Bay   -^ac^ annua^ regatta in February over  Rfpatta *ke course in Biscayne Bay at Miami  Beach is the occasion of increased interest, attracting yachtsmen from all portions of the United  States who enter into the competition for speed and endurance records, and machinery manufacturers who are  interested in the workings of the machinery which is back of  the speed. Visitors usually prolong their stay in Miami, if  they intended leaving earlier, in order to enjoy this rare  attraction, for the Biscayne Bay course is in a class all its  own, par excellent from the viewpoint of the yachtsman and  exciting enough for the spectators. These events are accompanied by other water stunts and some in the air, three days  or more being given to this attraction each year. Behind this  regatta is the master spirit of Carl G. Fisher, as promoter,  who interests himself each year in seeing that the details are  carried out. Records made in these contests have set the pace  several times for speed boats of the classes competing. &  The Place to Hunt  Hunting in season is rewarded  here by plentiful results. Deer  and bear are found in the Everglades, and wild cat are frequently killed. Quail and duck are numerous, and often  wild geese are brought down. In the woods squirrel abound  in certain sections. The game laws of Florida afford ample  protection to wild animals, to allow their propagation, and  a revenue for school purposes is derived from licenses issued  to hunters under direction of the state. Game wardens look  after the enforcement of the game laws. License to hunt  may be obtained in each county from the county judge.  FLEET OF Floating palaces constitute the  FLOATING PALACES winter-season fleet which assem-  bles each year in Biscayne .Day,  scores of yachts from New York, Baltimore, Philadelphia  and other clubs being anchored here in artistic array. From  anchorage they steal away at times for cruises down the bay  or out into the ocean, frequently taking days and weeks  away on fishing and hunting expeditions. Entertainments  are given on board many of the yachts.

As the winter season advances the fishing fleets become  busy in quest of commercial fish, taking mullet, mackerel,  kingfish and other varieties and bringing them to Miami for  shipment to other cities. This industry increases in importance each year. One of the fisheries during the past summer  launched the finest boat of the Atlantic fishing fleet, and it  was built entirely in Miami.  Professional fishermen with boats for hire take parties to  the fishing grounds, and these often return with marvelous  catches of tarpon, sailfish, grouper, barracuda, kingfish, shark,  bonefish, and the hundreds of varieties found in these waters.  Public Library  Churches and  Schools  Many beautiful churches attract the  attention of the visitor to Miami and  the buildings are in keeping with the  architectural plans of the city. There is a liberal attendance,  and inspiring sermons, choirs of trained voices and modern  pipe organs may be found in edifices of almost every creed.  Education takes first rank in Miami and Dade County,  and the probabilities are that in no other section of the South  is there offered for public approval a better system of schools,  and the standards set for the teaching corps are unusually  high. The intellectual tone of the city in general is very  high. The public-school buildings are constructed of concrete — fireproof — attractive in appearance and particular  attention paid to light and air. The public schools of Miami  and Dade County are free to the children of visitors. In  addition to the public schools there is also a parochial school,  several exclusive private schools, and the Pan-American  College of Commerce is a high-class business school and  well patronized.  For readers of books, Miami has its  public library and free reading room,  operated and maintained by the Woman's Club, an organization of several hundred members. Through the efforts  of the Library Association and the Woman's Club frequent  lectures, concerts and entertainments are given.  Musical  A new organization in Miami which promises  to take prominence in the social life of the city  is the Miami Symphony Orchestra, of about thirty instruments. The players are all residents of the city, and the  work of the orchestra has been highly commended.  Other musical organizations include the Y-singers, an  organization of male voices which will encourage grand  opera for Miami, and the Troubadours, also men singers.  Each church choir, also, is a musical feature in itself.  Notably  Elegant Homes  In and near the city of Miami, dotting the shore line of the bay and  ocean, are homes which, for their  completeness and tropical environments and adornments,  rank high in the annals of American architecture. Among  these is Villa Vizcaya, the home of James Deering, of New  York and Paris, who has established his legal residence in  Miami. The tropical countries have been searched for rare  specimens of plant life which have been brought to the Deering estate, and the palace is filled with art treasures rare and  valuable. Carl G. Fisher is one of the builders of notable  homes, also, and through his effort large investments have  been made in palatial residences which are adding continually to the prestige of Miami as a high-class residential city.

In a very few months vessels of deep draught may  enter with their cargoes without difficulty and Miami will  enjoy an opportunity for general shipping, consignments of  merchandise to Miami for this section, shipments of certain  classes of vegetables outgoing, and passenger traffic for those  who prefer sea journeys. The city is now well provided with  docks and warehouses, and further development of docking  facilities will be made to keep abreast of the traffic. Besides  the ordinary Atlantic coastwise traffic, vessels enter here  regularly from the Bahama Islands, British possessions, with  which Miami has quite an important volume of trade.  INDUSTRIAL MlAMI No.t surrendering in the least any  of its charms as a tourist center,  Miami is gradually adding industrial features which are  gratifying for the present and significant for the future.  Among the industrial innovations for the year 1919 is a  25,000-barrel storage for fuel oil, with a system of large  tanks into which oil is piped direct from tankers at the city  wharf. This enables the bunkering of any size boats that  may enter the port. Entrance of loaded tankers through the  new government cut which connects Biscayne Bay with the  Atlantic Ocean has demonstrated the practicability of the  deep-water channel in the bay, the especial convenience being that the boats land at the city's docks in the heart of  Miami's business section. Another of the latest innovations  which has worked out a much-desired public convenience  is the establishment of a spacious modern fireproof warehouse capable of transacting all of the business naturally  associated with such an institution.  AGRICULTURAL Miami is the natural market for farm  INTERESTS Products grown in portions of the  Everglades and on the mainland below  and above the city. The Miami River and canal are waterways permitting passage of boats which haul some of these  farm products. Trucks are also freely used where roads  reach the farms. In recent years stock raising has been notably added to the farming enterprises and with distinct  success. Hogs and cattle, sheep, goats and poultry, and even  pigeons raised commercially, are found to yield handsomely  in reward to those who give them proper attention. Miami  has a curb market in which the farmers of this immediate  section sell their products direct to consumers on certain  days of the week, proving an advantage to buyer and seller.  Demonstrating the agricultural interests, Dade County  has its annual fair, an institution nearly as old as the city itself, held at the bay front in Royal Palm park. In this fair  exhibits of live stock, poultry, vegetables, canned goods and  preserves, needle work, machinery and everything else interesting to the agriculturist, are made, and visitors obtain,  through this medium, an excellent idea of the real adaptability of the soil of this section to raising the various crops.  The fruit exhibits at this fair include the various citrus  fruits for which Dade County has become famous, and the  preserved products from these fruits.  Among the crops which are the most largely sent into the  markets of the world from Miami are tomatoes, grapefruit,  avocadoes, limes, oranges, beans, eggplant, peppers, potatoes and sweet potatoes.  PUBLICATIONS Miami has two daily newspapers, one  published in the morning and the other  in the evening, one monthly magazine and the Chamber of  Commerce monthly bulletin. These present Miami development facts attractively.  Public Utilities   Th(i pUibli^ utilities of MIaimi il?"  elude telephone, gas, water, electric  light and power, water and street railway systems.  These  are strongly financed and aggressive, keeping up with the  progress of the city and introducing modern methods as  rapidly as possible.   The street railway system is extended  to Miami Beach across the causeway.  Breaking Records  The fT1^ °f I?i9 broke all  records for Miami in a number  of important respects. It established a pace for an all-the-  year-round business, industrial and development season.  From the close of what is known as the "tourist season"  there was no cessation of general activities. The imaginary line of "the season" seemed to have been hopelessly  fractured if not entirely eliminated. Noises of saws and  hammers and concrete mixers predominated everywhere in  the city, and one summer month was only more completely  filled with industrial strenuousness than the one preceding  it. Money in the banks was more plentiful than ever, work  beckoned to labor, wages remained satisfactory, and in the  rush toward further construction of a great city there  seemed to be that unanimous desire of all interests to accomplish everything possible before the advent of the winter to  follow.  The first six months of the year 1919m Miami witnessed  building permits issued to a grand total of $1,665,100. In  the month of May the permits aggregated $560,600, in  June $450,450, and in July $400,300. These permits do  not represent more than half of the ultimate cost of structures and their furnishings, in all probability, and all of the  projects were under construction as soon as permits were  issued. Of the permits issued in June, $180,000 was for  hotels and apartments, and $139,150 for residences. Indications with the beginning of the last half of the year were  .hat the building conditions would continue at a corresponding rate.  Keeping pace with the material growth of Miami, the  financial conditions were most encouraging, and at the close  of the first half of the year deposits in the banks of the city  were a total of $11,503,031, a gain of 44 per cent over the  corresponding period of the year 1918. Two of the larger  banks of the city each had, on June 30, a million dollars  more in deposits than at the same time a year before, 	Text	image/tiff						80517885 Bytes	4849	5535	3607404523	RGB	8	600	asc99990000180024001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1187	1187	1188.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1188.jp2

Many who went away and returned during the summer declared that they found greater degree of comfort  here, with ocean breezes fanning them, than in congested  cities elsewhere or in mountains. Considerable progress was  made during the summer of 1919 in establishing Miami as  a really delightful summer resort.  A Railway Center   The: Florida East Coast Rail-  road has its shop yards in Miami  and this city is the center of all its operations on the southern section of the road. Miami is the starting point for the  Oversea Railway service to Key West. Fast trains from  New York, Chicago and intermediate points connect with  all lines from the North and West, and in the winter season  the railway maintains a forty-hour connection with New  York and rapid transit with other centers of the country.  Trains are especially equipped for the comfort of travelers.

Page 4																																	asc9999000007	asc99990000070004001		WHEN a child I often dreamed that I would some time have  a home in Florida, the land of flowers. My dream came true.  In addition I have had the thrill of seeing the magic city of Miami  grow from an infant and I want to share some of my experiences  with you.  I was born in Marshalltown, Iowa. When very young my  family moved west to Atlantic in the same state, where we had  for our neighbors, the Caleb Trapp family. It included the son,  Harlan, who was my childish sweetheart. In 1887, when he was  seventeen years old, Harlan went to Florida with his parents to  join his uncle, Mr. Samuel Rhodes, who had moved from Mississippi and purchased four hundred acres of government land, where  Coconut Grove is now located.  The Trapps settled on the shore of Biscayne Bay and lived for  about a year in a palmetto shack as the Seminole Indians did.  After a rain it was necessary to carry the contents of their shack  into the sun to dry and they found this very hard. Soon Caleb  Trapp decided to build a home. He and his son hewed the rock  from the cliff, upon which the house is built, with chisels and  hatchets, the only implements at hand. Mr. Trapp was the first  to use the coquina or native rock in building a home. All the  other early houses were made of logs and had dirt floors. Old  Fort Dallas was the only structure that had been built of coquina  at that time.  Harlan Trapp faithfully helped his father. He was a landlubber but soon overcame his fear of the sea and built himself a  crude sailboat. He went across the bay to the ocean after storms  and, using heavy cables, towed huge timbers, which had drifted  onto the beach from foundered lumber vessels. These he landed  at his own wharf and they were used as beams in the house.  Hardware for the building was sent from New York to Key West  and thence by schooner to Coconut Grove, taking six months in  transit.  Time went on. After nine years Harlan Trapp came back to  Iowa for his old sweetheart. We were married in August, 1895.  After a honeymoon of six weeks in Buffalo and Niagara Falls,  New York, we set out for the shores of Biscayne Bay. We took a  steamer to Cleveland, Ohio, on Lake Erie.  After we were com- 	Text	image/tiff						59127594 Bytes	3627	5434	455061524	RGB	8	600	asc99990000070004001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1195	1195	1196.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1196.jp2

He assured me that people were never seasick on lakes.  During the night I could feel the motion of the boat as the water  washed against the sides. About daylight I called to my husband  and said proudly, "Why, I didn't get the least bit seasick!"  Harlan laughingly said, "Why no wonder! We have been  tied to the dock all night for repairs."  This experience was recalled frequently later when seeking  consolation on waters that were really rough.  We took a train in Cleveland for Atlanta, Georgia, where we  boarded another train for Palm Beach. Then came my first experience in a small boat, which we took to Fort Lauderdale. I  was filled with fear, yet so thrilled with the tropical beauty along  the way that I kept my equilibrium, even though I expected to  go to the bottom of the river any moment. The people on the  launch with us thought we were brother and sister, but we did  not resemble each other in the least. Harlan was dignified and  serene and I, well—I was fun loving and full of life.  We reached Fort Lauderdale about dark. It was a wild country then. The atmosphere was humid. Mosquitoes by the hundreds buzzed around us and caused great lumps to rise over the  exposed parts of my body. There are no words to describe the  uncomfortable place in which we were obliged to spend the night.  However, we survived.  The next morning we got into a wagon with no springs. There  were two slabs across from one side to the other. The driver sat  on one and the bride and groom on the other. The mules were as  lazy as the worst. We followed the mail route until we reached  Lemon City. I had been expecting from its name to come upon  a thriving city. All the way down I would say to myself, "Well,  there is at least one regulated city in south Florida."  I asked the driver where the main part of Lemon City was.  He pointed to a shack with the sign "Post Office" above the door  and to another shack at the end of the boat landing, where I found  what was called a store. It contained a few bolts of brightly colored calico, some overalls and coarse jackets, also some canned  goods. I asked who bought the bright clothes and was told that  the Indians did. That brought vividly to my mind the thought  that I had always feared Indians. Thinking that a band might  come in at any moment to buy some calico, I ran to the boat, which  was to take us to Coconut Grove.  During the ride down from Lemon City it began to rain.

I went, but only to remain a few  moments for down in the cabin I experienced the most pungent  odor of my life. I told the captain I preferred the cockpit to the  cabin as there was evidently some sort of dead animal down there.  He laughed and informed me it was only a bag of guavas.  At last we landed at the private dock of the Trapp place on  beautiful Biscayne Bay, a short distance from the village of Coconut Grove. My first reactions after arriving at the stone house  were varied. As we left the dock and walked up the mud path  some six hundred feet to the house with mosquitoes galore, saw-  grass on either side, soldier crabs crawling under my feet, I sighed  and thought, "How can I endure all this?"  Then I went up the steps to the house and turned to look back  at the bay. The sight which caught my eyes was the reflection  of sunset, the most glorious rose, gold and purple colors, such as  are not found any place else on earth. I was transformed from a  weary, sad-hearted pilgrim to one who thought, "Why, with this  view, these tropical trees and moonlight from Bear's Cut on the  ocean, forming a silver path to our very dock, I shall have joy  untold!" So it has always been in spite of discouraging experiences.  I might mention that Bear's Cut is the entrance from the Atlantic  Ocean to Miami's great harbor.  Everything was different, oh, so different. I had never spent  a fortnight out of town or city in my life before. The first winter  I began to know what pioneering was. We kept house in a small  cottage in the woods. I hardly ever went into the yard without  encountering a snake or some creeping thing. I lived in fear of  the Indians, who came and peeked in the window at us. I bought  venison of them and tried to hide my fear as much as possible.  We found the Seminoles most docile and peaceful. They are  thrifty and traffic in alligator hides and shell ornaments. I was  amused to find that they liked fire-water and would go to any  extent to get some alcoholic drink. They would even buy bluing  at the Coconut Grove grocery and attempt to drink it for the  alcohol they thought it contained.  During my first winter there was severely cold weather, which  froze all the citrus fruit north of Palm Beach. This made many  families drift down into Dade County where Coconut Grove is  located.   Some brought money; others did not.

The old Peacock Inn was the only available place  and it was crude in all its appointments. It was kept by an English  cockney and his wife, Isabella. Many amusing incidents occurred  at this inn. Once there was a wedding of the Peacock relatives  when one of the guests, a Frenchman, wore a dress suit and came  bare-footed. Charlie Peacock, the proprietor, was a jolly old  fellow. He was a good cook and was kind to everyone. His son,  Alfred, helped about the inn and married Lilian Frow. Their  daughter is the charming wife of George E. Merrick. I first saw  Eunice Peacock Merrick when she was two weeks old.  There were no roads down from Palm Beach at this time. After  the freeze some of the impoverished ones came through the jungle  or Brickell Hammock to investigate the feasibility of planting  citrus trees where only wild lime trees grew at the time. It was  an unpromising outlook. The people interested would gather at  the Trapp home and discuss the discouraging prospects. These  councils were the beginning of what we all know as the greatest  fruit industry of its kind in the world.  Harlan's mother, Henrietta Trapp, was a mother to all, giving  of her scant bounty where needed. She would always have an oil  lamp burning at night in one of the upper rooms of the Trapp's  stone house to guide mariners who had lost their course. The light  was the means of saving many lives. It would attract insects, however, so it was necessary to keep the windows closed, which made  the room stifling. But no matter how uncomfortable it was, the  light was always there after dark. Mrs. Henrietta Trapp was a  woman of rare culture and taught the first school in Coconut  Grove. There was much amusement over one of her pupils, a  twelve-year-old boy, who thought the Governor of the State  was the old Charlie Peacock, keeper of the inn.  Frequently we went out in my husband's trim little sloop  for Biscayne Bay was the magnet. We kept near it or on it as  much as possible. Oh, the sunrises, sunsets, moonlight and fishing  we enjoyed!  One of my most thrilling experiences was a trip to Fowery  Lighthouse in a storm and a night spent in the lighthouse. I  climbed up and lit the huge light, which in those early days was  stationary. Later it was made a revolving light. Our night there  is unforgetable.  We slept on iron cots.

As the storm raged the waves  struck those pipes at different angles and with varying force. It  sounded as distant orchestral music. Always from childhood I  could imagine hearing beautiful music and discerned sweet and  harmonious tones from many sources other than real musical instruments, so it was no wonder that this experience was music  to my ears.  We reached the lighthouse before the storm about four o'clock  in the afternoon when the assistant keeper was preparing a huge  turtle steak for our supper. It was a hawk's bill turtle, the kind  that furnished tortoise shell for making combs and other articles.  Captain Robert Thompson was the keeper at the time. He was  the father of Captain James Thompson, owner of the Yuma, a  charter boat, Charles Thompson of big fish fame, George and  Robert Thompson. After supper we were asked if we would  like to feed the fish, and, of course, I did. We threw the food  down on the coral rocks and the most beautiful fish came up  like chickens and ate. I remember the parrot fish as being the  most attractive. We had seen them at the Atlanta exposition  on our way down to Florida and never dreamed we would have  the thrill of feeding such fish in their native waters.  Coconut Grove village was named by a small group of winter  visitors and residents in the vicinity adjoining Biscayne Bay about  four miles below the Miami River from Brickell Point. These  people were seated one day under a small grove of coconuts and  decided that would be an appropriate name. It was not incorporated until 1919 when a post office was desired. This was first  located where the fish market now stands. Across from the post  office, up on the bluff, was the general store of Arthur Sanders.  It was a cash and carry store. For all of us who traded there it  was a task to carry home supplies as we had only a rocky trail  upon which to travel.  It was hard for me to conquer homesickness. At last Dr.  Kegwin, a Presbyterian minister, came along. He noted my state  of mind and wanted to help me out of the blues. I told him to  get up a revival and I would help. Then I remembered that the  only church building was a mile and a half from the Trapps. There  were no roads. All my shoes were pretty, not fitted for travel  over palmettas, rocks and sand, so I went down to Peacock's store  and bought a pair for the purpose. They were crude, of course,  had heavy soles and brass buttons. We made arrangements for  the revival.   I was janitor, organist and choir.  5  % , £ V?       *—» **3«v r\ r\ Y  *■ * University of Miami 	Text	image/tiff						58459212 Bytes	3586	5434	72588406	RGB	8	600	asc99990000070008001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1199	1199	1200.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1200.jp2

In most instances I had  to give them baths and comb their hair, then urge the older folk  to follow us to church. Allow me to say that at the time I had  a voice of fair quality and I must confess, as Dr. Kegwin did,  that my singing and my streak of comedy brought the people out.  Rev. Kegwin was fine. After several weeks of hard work we  built up a good congregation.  Speaking of diversions in the early days, one I recall vividly  was a trip to the Everglades. Mr. Trapp and I took his trim little  sloop, which he built, and sailed up the Miami River until we  reached the Everglades, where we anchored the boat and got into  a dingey, sailing over the prairies. I thought of the prairie schooners out west. This was a trip by boat schooner, which was certainly thrilling. We saw alligators sunning themselves on the  protruding rocks, and oh, how wickedly their eyes stared at us!  We saw a variety of lilies and there were many odd creatures  swimming near our boat. One moment I was trembling with  fright; the next I would see lovely flowers nodding at us. It was  a mixture of sensations, I can assure you.  My husband's uncle, Mr. Samuel Rhodes, was the first Treasurer of Dade County. He was a generous and helpful citizen.  Many of the old settlers owe him for the very foundations of  their homes and all they possess. He kept his treasurer's funds  in a tin box, buried in the ground near his place. Once a fire  swept through his property. It was a great relief when Mr. Rhodes  dug up the box after the fire and found the money intact.  We made the trip from Coconut Grove by sailboat, the only  mode of travel during my first two years, to the home of Mrs.  Julia Tuttle on the Miami River at old Fort Dallas. Here, let  me bless the women who have saved the old Fort building. They  had it moved and set up where in after years people could look  at it and enjoy its historic significance. Always we were happy  at Mrs. Tuttle's. Her home was cosy. In the dining room there  was a plate rail filled with rare saucers and plates. She would  say to us, "Children, I will have some one come down here from  Palm Beach and start to build a town."  In Miami at that time there were only two or three shacks  called stores. Mrs. Tuttle had gotten in touch with Mr. Ingram,  who was Mr. Henry N. Flagler's agent. She was trying to persuade him to bring Mr. Flagler to see the beauty and attractiveness of what is now Miami.  At last the great man did come.  —= 	Text	image/tiff						58244052 Bytes	3586	5414	546499088	RGB	8	600	asc99990000070009001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1200	1200	1201.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1201.jp2

Then a town, to be called  Miami, and pronounced five different ways, was started.  I recall a time when Mr. Trapp and I had lunch with Mrs.  Julia Tuttle at old Fort Dallas and the late Henry N. Flagler was  present, looking over plans for the town. He said, "Julia, we will  not bother much about streets or their width. There will only  be a few who will come down here to fish from Palm Beach and  one hotel will suffice."  One day Mrs. Tuttle invited us to her home when they were  planning the lay-out of Miami's streets. She said to my husband,  "Harlan, I will give you one of the lots on Twelfth Street, now  known as Flagler Street, if you will buy the adjoining one for  $125.00."  Think of it! However, in those days we would have had to  break the bank to raise a hundred and twenty-five dollars. Two  miles from Coconut Grove ten-acre tracts were then selling for  homesteads at ten dollars an acre. I might say here that the lots  offered Mr. Trapp last sold for one million, five hundred thousand dollars!  When the first train came to Miami in 1896, we, who lived  in Coconut Grove just four and a half miles distant, went up in  sailboats to the mouth of the Miami River to greet it. As I have  said before this was the only mode of travel. There was an old  Indian trail through the Brickell Hammock, which was then inhabited by panthers and bears. Often at night while we were  sheltered in the stone house we could hear the cries of the panthers.  The female's cry sounds much like a woman's cry in distress.  Naturally, not many of us cared to follow this trail. We walked  about three miles from the river to the railroad station and saw  the Iron Horse come in. We met several men and women over  forty years old who had never seen a railroad train before.  The great oasis in the desert to one of my temperament was  Mary Barr Monroe, daughter of the distinguished novelist, Amelia  Barr. She was the first Mrs. Kirk Monroe. Whenever there was  a celebrity of little or great importance, at her home, she would  send a note by her colored man asking me to come down. If I  had no way of going, she would suggest my returning in the boat  with the colored man, staying for the function, and then having  Mr. Trapp come for me.  Those times stand out in bold relief for 	Text	image/tiff						59234814 Bytes	3647	5414	401004268	RGB	8	600	asc99990000070010001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1201	1201	1202.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1202.jp2

Mrs. Monroe was proud of her famous mother, whose story,  ^Remember The Alamo," has recently been dramatized for the  screen. Once I was loaned Amelia Barr's lovely silk gown and  wrap to wear during a program I gave at the Woman's Club. I  cherish this as a loving memory.  We remember with much sentiment the old Royal Palm Hotel.  How grand it seemed and how we greeted the season tickets a  few of us received from Mr. Merrill, the first manager! We surely  enjoyed his hospitality. In sailboats we would go up from Coconut Grove and have the most delightful times.  The Coconut Grove Audubon Society was started by Mrs.  Kirk Monroe, who championed the snowy egret. Meetings of the  society were held in her house. Frequently prominent New York  socialites from the Royal Palm Hotel were her guests. If any  wore the plumes of these birds in their hats, she would insist upon  having the plumes removed. Largely by her efforts the purchase  and wearing of these egrets became illegal.  When Mr. Trapp and I were invited to dine with the Kirk  Monroes, I had the courage afterwards to ask for some of the  recipes for the dishes that were served. I was an apt scholar and  was proud of being able to duplicate some of her delicious food.  Then came the road from Coconut Grove to Miami. My husband's uncle, Mr. Samuel Rhodes, gave the first thousand dollars  for its building. In those days there were only half a dozen wagons  and mules. The road was so slippery that the horses' or mules'  feet would slide back several inches with every step. It would  take an hour and a half to get to town to buy a spool of thread  at the Douglas' store or a cool drink at Belchers'; then another  hour and a half to return. That left only a short time to take in  the sights, which consisted principally in going to watch them  paint the great Royal Palm Hotel and count the number of Dade  County residents on the street, twelve or fourteen in all.  My husband taught the first school in Dade County, which  was located in Lemon City. Miss Flora McFarland of New Jersey,  taught the second school in Coconut Grove. She also organized  the Housekeepers' Club, which was a wonderful help in those  pioneer days.  One time the building where the club met was badly in need  of paint.   Some other members and myself decided it should be 	Text	image/tiff						59234814 Bytes	3647	5414	3193298074	RGB	8	600	asc99990000070011001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1202	1202	1203.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1203.jp2

Those  were great days and a wonderful spirit of neighborliness prevailed.  We did our bit during the Spanish American War. Just a  short distance from our home was an improvised fort for rifle  target practice. Some of the soldiers, mostly college boys, had  never held a gun. Mosquitoes were there by the thousands. Our  pump was on a screened back porch of our cottage. Somehow  our water tasted better to them than what they had on the practice grounds. They would return again and again, sometimes  asking to come in. I was apt to be baking pies or cookies. When  the practice was over in the evening my store of pies and cookies  was much depleted. I was glad to mend their torn garments and  gave them all we had for an improvised hospital across the road.  The climate during the first ten years after I arrived in 1895  did not vary ten degrees the year afound. At Christmas it was  the same as in August. It was decidedly warm when we roasted  our Christmas turkey, that had been shipped from New York by  steamer to Key West and thence by slow schooner to Coconut  Grove.  During these early years I was tortured with what the natives  called Florida boils and was told they were good for my health.  I would have preferred fewer boils and to take a chance with my  health. !  Some time after Reverend Kegwin's departure for the north  a few of us got together with Reverend James Bolton and organized a Congregational Church. There were six charter members.  I am the last one left. The church building was a community  project. Commodore Ralph Monroe helped financially and gave  the ground for the building. Isabel Peacock, the inn keeper's wife,  gave of her time and money and the church was soon established.  During the winter, guests from the inn attended services and  Mrs. Peacock solicited funds from them with which to carry on  much of the work. Later the Congregationalists took possession  of the building. Reverend Bolton met an untimely death for he  was shot by an enraged negro.  After we had struggled for a time our good friends, Commodore and Mrs. Arthur Curtis James, offered to help us build a  church. The Ladies' Aid Society decided we could raise ten thousand dollars toward the amount needed to start. Mrs. James met  us half way and gave ten thousand dollars. She employed an  architect from New York, paid his expenses to visit old Mexico 	Text	image/tiff						58133172 Bytes	3566	5434	3664578366	RGB	8	600	asc99990000070012001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1203	1203	1204.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1204.jp2

He could not speak or understand  English, so an interpreter was arranged for. The members and  people of the community took great pride in this lovely structure  on Devon Road. As I said before, I am the only charter member  living. Reverend George E. Merrick was the pastor after the tragic  death of Reverend Bolton. Next came Reverend Harley Core,  then Reverend George B. Spaulding; later, Dr. J. D. Kuykendall,  who is still the pastor.  One of my early memories was the beginning of the pineapple  industry in the United States. Pineapples were raised by the thousands on the Florida keys and we used to go in boats to get them.  Commodore Ralph Monroe, besides giving the ground for the  community church, helped with all civic affairs in Coconut Grove.  About fifty-five years ago he conceived the idea of organizing the  Biscayne Bay Yacht Club. There were eight charter members  and Harlan Trapp is the only survivor. Recently the club extended to him an honorary life membership. Now when the club  holds its annual chowder party and regatta on Hugh Mathewson's  property on Key Biscayne on Washington's Birthday, it is a far  cry from the small affairs they used to have in the old days.  In speaking of Miami's early financial struggles, I recall the  time when Mr. James Deering began to build his famous Villa  Viscaya from the virgin hammock, a jungle in fact. It was not  alone a structure of beauty and art, but was the means of providing real help to the community. At the time Miami was undergoing a financial problem, known to few towns of its size. Money  that Mr. Deering expended for materials and for payrolls saved  Miami and gave her the first real start. About eight hundred men  were employed for a year and others for a much longer period.  I remember meeting dear old Mrs. William Deering, the mother,  while the building was being completed. I asked her what they  would name the marvelous place. She said, "Well, Mrs. Trapp,  I do not know what James will call it, but I call it the 'Deering  Folly'!"  Afterwards she loved it and admired it as we all did.  On the grounds of the old Trapp home are many rare trees  and shrubs, planted in the early days. Seeds were frequently  brought to the family by travelers returning to the states from  foreign countries. The famous Trapp avocado tree, now fifty-  four years old, stands at the rear of the house. Mr. George Cellon,  noted horticulturist, assisted the Trapps in establishing this late-  bearing tree. After my arrival I had quite a bit of pin money from  10 	Text	image/tiff						59345214 Bytes	3627	5454	276730497	RGB	8	600	asc99990000070013001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1204	1204	1205.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1205.jp2

This does not sound  so extravagant when I tell you that salad for six people can easily  be made from one of these large avocadoes.  Mrs. Haden, widow of John Haden, who originated the famous  Haden mango, is still living in Coconut Grove. She came the same  year I arrived as a bride and we have shared many experiences.  During the later struggles of the fruit growers and farmers in  Dade County, Commodore and Mrs. Arthur Curtis James gave  liberally to help them become established. Many of our young  people have received their education and start in life largely  through their kindness.  The steps used in the old stone house of the Trapps are reverenced today. In cutting out uniform blocks from the terrace,  when the house was built, there was formed a broad expanse of  steps sixty feet in width. The house was also constructed with  double walls. Harlan Trapp, years afterwards, was able to enlarge the dwelling by using the inner walls. Many celebrities  visited this old stone house, including James Whitcomb Riley,  Minnie Moore Wilson, whose books about the Seminoles are authoritative, Jack London, William R. Lighton, contributor for  many years to the Saturday Evening Post and Country Gentleman,  also many others.  Yes, I am glad I lived in the dear old days of Miami. Its growth  has been amazing. I was one who wondered at the time of the  building of the first high school, now in ashes, if we would ever  have enough children to fill a high school.  Pioneers must have resourceful minds. Mr. Trapp founded  and established a new industry, the digging and grinding of the  coontie root. When ground and refined these roots make starch  equal to the finest arrow root. It was hard digging it from rocky  ground. The red water, which comes from the process of grinding is excellent fertilizer for trees and shrubs.  Life as a pioneer in Dade County, Florida, has been full of  hardships, but there has been room for romance and I would not  exchange the memories I have for those of any life of luxury I  could imagine.  11 	Text	image/tiff						58674372 Bytes	3586	5454	563931695	RGB	8	600	asc99990000070014001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1205	1205	1206.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1206.jp2

Because Miami is as much a "state of mind"  as it is an actual place. The mere name Miami calls up  thoughts of a sunnier, better way of living, a complete  freedom from care, an appreciation of the peaceful blessings  that make life good. So, more than towering hotels or quiet  tropic homes, more than gay diversions of clubs and casinos  or quiet pleasures of sea and sunshine, Miami is a mood—an  escape from the cares and troubles of a workaday world—  an escape for everyone, from bankers and brokers to quiet  pensioners. That is why no picture, however good, can really  tell Miami's story. The color camera comes close—yet the  true Miami must be seen and felt in person. m  Library  (JNIVPPSITY OF MIAMI  ^^Cu Z Z"y 		image/tiff						68368512 Bytes	4528	5033	3440603054	RGB	8	600	asc99990000260002001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1208	1208	1209.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1209.jp2

Its appeal is a light-hearted,  carefree appeal—fun for all, playing themselves or  looking on while champions and sports leaders make  the nation's headlines. If this is your mood—Miami  has the answer, an amazing array of things to do  that defies parallel. Yet Miami is a cosmopolitan  city—a complete city—all things to all men—so  that, if the bright lights have no appeal to you,  there's another complete Miami that fits your requirements—Miami as a city of "heart-lines."

Active, too, but a  more quiet round of picnics, golf, beach parties,  sightseeing and fishing trips—carefree pursuits that  naturally keep you outdoors most of the time—out  in the health preserving salt sea air and ultra-violet  sunshine. Residents and vacationists in this Miami  need never see a tournament, or a race, or a night  club. Yet their lives are full indeed, of the warm  companionship, of the peaceful living which, in  this troubled year, will be more than ever appreciated—the things that are always nearest and dearest to the heart. 		image/tiff						69183552 Bytes	4528	5093	3329578849	RGB	8	600	asc99990000260003001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1209	1209	1210.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1210.jp2

Won't the trip to Miami consume a lot of vacation time?  No. Miami is only a matter of hours from 85 %  of the population. It is the southern terminal  of many of the nation's fastest and finest air,  rail, bus and boat services and of highway  U. S. 1. For actual travel time, consult your  local ticket agent.  Why is Miami called America's "Metropolis  of the Tropics"?  Because this is the southernmost major U. S  city. Because Miami is the hub of the only  truly tropical area in continental U. S.—a land  where royal, cocoanut and other types of palm;  gumbo limbo, strangler fig and Madeira mahogany trees; and many other tropical trees,  shrubs and plants, grow wild. Because Miami  is unique — truly tropical — in architecture,  landscaping and coloring.  Is it easy to reach South America and the West  Indies from Miami?  Yes. Miami is the chief "crossroads" between  INorth and South America, being linked by regular plane service with 33 foreign countries  and colonies.

In summer 90° is a rare "high,"  96° the all-time "high." Check comparative temperatures  in your daily newspapers.  How do Miami temperatures compare with those of other  resorts?  Nice, France, winter average is 48°; Cairo, Egypt, 54°;  Los Angeles, California, 56°; Naples, Italy, 58°; and  Miami, Florida, 68°.  Q What causes this pleasant climate?  A  Unique solar-marine conditions. Miami is "heated" in  winter by the Gulf Stream, cooled in summer by constant ocean trade winds. There are no hot or cold  "waves." Surf remains at about 70° all year.  Is the Miami climate healthful?  Yes.   Respiratory   ailments   are   rare.  Health-building outdoor activities are  matter-of-course. Clean air, free  from smoke, dust and pollen,  assures more ultra-violet rays,  relief from hay fever, asthma.

A  Q  Golf Tournaments?  A  Yes. Fastest in America, at colorful Hialeah and Tropical  Parks.  Many are world-famous, including several carrying the  largest stakes offered anywhere. Every champion, every  "big money" professional, comes to Miami.  Q  What about football?  A   Complete season schedules are followed by the Championship Orange Bowl Classic on New Year's Day.  A K E  Q Regattas?  Q  They are held regularly all year. The winter season is  climaxed by the famous Miami-Nassau and Sir Thomas  Lipton Cup Races.  What else?  /^ Jai-Alai world's fastest game; dog racing; swimming,  tennis skeet, trap shooting and pistol matches; dog and  horse shows; fishing tournaments, air shows, ball games  archery meets, speedboat time trials, boxing shows, etc!

Miami is ideal for children either during  "   the winter or all year.  |%   What about the health angle?  A Almost continuous sunshine and Miami's  " equable solar-marine climate encourage health-  building outdoor play in light clothing. There  are many well-supervised and equipped playgrounds, ocean beaches and pools, where they  can learn to swim. "Sound minds in sunned  bodies" is an apt description of Miami's youngest generation.  j u  I   O  R  S  Are there plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables?  Yes—all year long—garden and grove ripened,  ready to eat. That is because absence of frost and  freezing permits the "staggering" of plant maturity  to allow ripening of crops during all four seasons.  High calcium content helps build strong bones. All  beneficial vitamins and minerals are present in  ample quantities.  What about the school situation?  Miami's many fine schools, public and private, have  highest accredited ratings. Classes are often held  outdoors in patios or on palm-shaded lawns. All  Miami schools permit entrance throughout their  terms and prepare pupils for return to northern  schools at any time without loss of standing.  What is there for them to do?  The City Recreation Department's program for children  includes special events  all  year  long—"circuses," pet shows, bicycle parades, model airplane       h  meets and so on down the list.  PICTURES:    Supervised   playgrounds    feature   schools    and   public  parks.   Ultra-violet   sunshine   for  a  "golden   generation".  And  even  school classes  move  outdoors—adding  new  interest  and  incentives  to growing minds.

Thousands of retired persons have chosen Miami  as the best  place  in  which to  settle  permanently.  How does Miami add to their health and longevity?  They are protected by Miami's pleasant climate from  respiratory and other ills caused by the shock of  wide fluctuations or sudden changes in temperatures.  They are kept warm in winter by the curative South  Florida sunshine, while the very salt sea air is  charged with healthful chemical elements the year  'round. For those recovering from illness Miami's  nationally renowned hospitals and sanitaria provide  every modern facility including specially developed  sun ray and heliotherapy treatments.  Are there quiet amusements and diversions—opportunities for relaxation and rest?  Yes. There are extensive layouts for shuffleboard,  croquet, checkers and similar games; and there are  many quiet residential sections of the city entirely  free from noise and crowds. Present low rentals in  these sections are particularly attractive to pensioners  and other persons with moderate incomes. Many beautiful park areas are reserved for those who seek  relaxation. New contacts and friendships are easily  made in congenial Miami, providing new interests  and a fresh outlook on life.

Yes. Every social, religious or cultural facility  found in any representative American city is  present in Miami.  Are most denominations represented among the  churches?  Yes.  There are 91  churches  in  Miami,  each  of  which extends a warm welcome to visitors.  What opportunity is there for the stranger to  make new acquaintances and friends?  Miami's unique Civic Centre, sponsored by the  Chamber of Commerce and in operation all year,  exists for this very purpose. State Clubs are  organized to enable those from any locality to  meet "home state" people at dances, dinners,  luncheons and parties. Many general gatherings,  open to everyone, promote a friendly "get  acquainted" spirit.  PICTURES:  Picnics  and parties  are popular—even  in midwinter.

A The great Bayfront Amphitheatre, seating 6,000,  maintains a full schedule of concerts, recitals,  operettas, pageants, lectures, etc., the year 'round.  Most of them are presented free of charge. The  unique "Three Score and Ten Club," restricted to  those past 70, carries out a program of dances,  outings and other functions each year.  QWhat strictly cultural facilities are available in  Miami?  A Art galleries, including Miami Art Center, open  all year; libraries; women's clubs; symphony,  vocal and instrumental concerts; plays—everything  to   be  expected   in   a   large,   modern  city.  QWhat unusual types of people are encountered in  Miami's social circles?  A Many world-leaders in arts and sciences enabled  because of the city's informal atmosphere to  mingle more freely than usual with others; and  the members of Miami's large and interesting  Latin-American colony.

A Almost all are completely furnished, including  linens, silver, china and glassware to meet the  requirements of transient or semi-transient  visitors.  Do they resemble the general conception of  "furnished apartments?"  No. Miami's apartments, usually planned by  decorators, are comfortable, tastefully-arranged  homes.

Q What housing facilities are usually preferred  ■ by retired people or other "year 'round" resi  dents?  A    Small apartments or houses in quiet residential  and suburban sections.  Are there plenty of these?  Yes. Thousands of moderately priced apartments and small homes have been built during  the last few years. Thousands more are now  under construction in a building program that  is currently topping a million dollars a month.  Part of them are being erected by private individuals, attracted by moderate homesite and  building costs and excellent available architectural talent. Others are being built to be sold  at reasonable prices, ready for occupancy.  Miami is building faster than many much larger  cities. For she must keep pace with the demands  of those who have discovered it costs no more  to live in Florida sunshine than to pay fuel bills  and fight cold winters in the north.  Homes   follow   a   modified   Spanish   tradition  ideally  suited  to Miami's  tropic  climate  and  historic tradition. 		image/tiff						68943372 Bytes	4548	5053	2800114860	RGB	8	600	asc99990000260019001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1225	1225	1226.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1226.jp2
Page 20																																	asc9999000026	asc99990000260020001		c  o  s  T  s  Three important facts influence every Miami budget: 1. Living costs are about the same as those in comparable  non-resort cities. 2. Bills for heating-fuel and heavy clothing are negligible or non-existent. 3. Taxes are held to a minimum by a favorable "Homestead Exemption" law.  We have tried to picture below, in very general coss-section, Miami's "average" prices and rates. Most of the  city's guest facilities are designed for normally well-situated, substantial, typical American families of from two to five  persons—people of "average" incomes who want comfort without ostentation, good wholesome food without fancy "trimmings." Costs designated "above average" are for luxury accommodations.  It is well to remember that plenty of "minimum" living quarters are available during November, December, Apr1 T  and May, but that since they fill first, occasionaly only higher-priced accommodations are available in mid-season.  Summer rates are well below the lowest figures quoted.  Due to a construction program currently adding to Miami's guest facilities in every size and price range at  a million-dollars-a-month clip, it is not expected that any general rise in prices will affect the rates and living costs  listed below.  OF     LIVING  HOTELS Average     Above Average  Single, with bath, daily  $3.00 $4.50-5.00  Double, with bath, daily  $5.00 $7.50-8.50  Minimum rates in smaller hotels are below these average prices—  deluxe accommodations in the leading hotels  slightly higher.

Summer rates range as  much as 50% lower. Many very fine but smaller "efficiency" apartments may be found at lower rates than shown, particularly in fall  and spring months.

CLOTHING  Light, inexpensive clothing is worn the year around. Savings on heavy  clothing are considerable among all-winter and permanent residents.

NIGHT LIFE  It is virtually impossible to arrive at any satisfactory way of summarizing costs. Suffice it to say that various clubs cater to various  groups of tastes, from intimate, inexpensive "no' cover charge" types  to ultra-swank casinos—and that charges are governed by the ex-  clusiveness of the club in question and the entertainment offered.

They  ea pe from all walks of life — from every state — a million  "te&timonials" to Miami's universal appeal. Obviously they  couldn't all have been wealthy. For the most part they were  just solid, substantial Americans.  By their example they prove beyond a doubt that virtually  everyone can arrange and afford a Miami vacation. Yet far too  often people think of Miami in terms of "lovely I'm sure, but  not for folks like us."  Let this final thought sum up your impressions of this booklet:  Miami is a complete American city offering a full range of  recreation and accommodations to old and young, to persons  of every standard of living and income group, to the gay and  the reserved — offering a sunnier, happier way of living to ALL  America — whether for brief vacation, winter residence, or the  rest of your lives.  To visit Miami, to live here, you need primarily the will to do  so. Then, follow the example of that sensible million who last  year found or invented ways and means of making their dream  come true.

They  ea pe from all walks of life — from every state — a million  "te&timonials" to Miami's universal appeal. Obviously they  couldn't all have been wealthy. For the most part they were  just solid, substantial Americans.  By their example they prove beyond a doubt that virtually  everyone can arrange and afford a Miami vacation. Yet far too  often people think of Miami in terms of "lovely I'm sure, but  not for folks like us."  Let this final thought sum up your impressions of this booklet:  Miami is a complete American city offering a full range of  recreation and accommodations to old and young, to persons  of every standard of living and income group, to the gay and  the reserved — offering a sunnier, happier way of living to ALL  America — whether for brief vacation, winter residence, or the  rest of your lives.  To visit Miami, to live here, you need primarily the will to do  so. Then, follow the example of that sensible million who last  year found or invented ways and means of making their dream  come true.

Tourists followed the invalids  and soon outnumbered them.  Other recreations were demanded, and for several years tennis was the fad,  the game being played by champions of the  United States all along the Florida East Coast.  Bicycling followed, and it came to stay.  The most popular of out-door sport to find a  home on Florida's East Coast is the ancient and  royal game of Golf.

Though ten degrees nearer the equator than southern Italy, the temperature is no warmer, while  the air is far more equable and dry. The reason  for this has never been clearly established ; but it  is well known that the Gulf Stream carries off  immense quantities of the surplus heat of the  region, and that branches of the returning Arctic  current tends to cool its shores and is a potent  factor in maintaining the surprising equilibrium  of its temperature.

Its  five courses, the best in the  South, are open to all members, and during the long  winter season there are daily  tournaments, individual  matches, and team games.  The whole beautiful section  herein pictured is devoted  to Golf.  •dirt!*r 		image/tiff						64120140 Bytes	5330	4010	3192986305	RGB	8	600	asc99990000240033001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1264	1264	1265.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1265.jp2

The membership of the club,  the oldest in the State, is composed of wealthy cottagers  and hotel guests.  At Ormond, the Golf Club House is directly opposite  the Ormond Station of the Florida East Coast Railway.  The links here are quite sporty, and even from the clubs  of experts many a ball finds its permanent resting place  in Dismal Swamp.  But in winter the Mecca of golfers from all over the  country is Palm Beach. Each year the number of players on this course increases.  Ideal golfing weather prevails at Miami during the  winter, and the links there are very popular.  The last links of the East Coast chain jump across  the Gulf Stream to English territory, landing on the old  Fort Charlotte Reservation at Nassau. No course in the  chain offers more sport and good exercise, and nowhere  is golf enjoyed more than on these picturesquely located  grounds overlooking the beautiful sea and harbor. 		image/tiff						62437314 Bytes	4007	5194	812487449	RGB	8	600	asc99990000240034001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1265	1265	1266.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1266.jp2

Not a chill  or shiver throughout those Winter days, when, twenty-four  hours by rail to the northward, the country is locked in ice  and snow.  Climate is the chief asset of a Winter resort, and even if  Florida had not its great natural beauties, its wonderful beaches  for bathing, driving and motoring, its long miles of shell roads,  ideal golf courses, rare sport in both fresh and salt-water fishing,  and every other known diversion for outdoor life and indoor  entertainment, combined with the most magnificent hotels on  the continent—if it had not all of these things, it would still  be entitled to the distinction of being, by reason of its perfect  climate, the greatest Winter resort in the world. And with its  summer trade winds and climatic equability, it has, moreover,  an undeniable claim to being a delightful resort for Summertime vacationists.  Sunshine and flowers are the outward manifestations of the  joy of Nature, and of these Florida has more than a generous  share. It has, also, a wealth of beautiful scenery which every  Florida visitor sees and enjoys all the time that he remains  within the boundaries of the State; for it is all about him—  tropical jungles whose trees are enveloped in the mystic gray  moss, and whose air is heavy with the perfumes of rare flowers  and shrubs. Palmettos, cocoanuts, magnolias, live oaks and  palms of every description, and countless trees and gorgeous  blooming things unfamiliar to northern eyes, shade every avenue  and country road, and line alike the woodland path and the  city walk.

Everywhere, boating in all its variety and charm may  be enjoyed under conditions as nearly ideal as may be. The  lakes and rivers give safe and delightful canoeing; and on the  bays and inlets, motor boating is exhilarating sport. Yachting  in Florida waters is one of the chief of the season's entertainments, while cruising all the way from St. Augustine to Key West  is always popular.  Social life centers in the magnificent East Coast hotels,  and the gayeties which begin at the St. Augustine palatial  hostelries, continue on down the coast and across the gulf  stream to Nassau, in the Bahama Islands. All the pomp and  circumstance demanded by society, and a continuous round of  sports and entertainments will be found in these resorts. Golf,  tennis, boating, motoring, surf-bathing, belong in the daily  routine. Golf is perhaps the favorite sport, and the Florida  golf courses are among the best in the country. Tennis is  next in popular favor, and splendid courts are maintained in  connection with all the hotels.  Motoring is the ideal diversion for any hour of the day on  roads leading through long avenues of enchanting scenes.  The famous Atlantic Ocean Beach Drive borders the East  Coast from the St. Johns to Palm Beach, and on certain sections  of it, such as the wonderful speedway at Ormond, automobile  races are a feature of the season's entertainment. Good fishing  and hunting are found everywhere on the East Coast Railway,  and guides, horses, dogs and boats are always available. Over  at Long Key, where this railroad is projected sixty miles over  the sea to Key West, the East Coast Hotel Company have  established a fine fishing camp for lovers of this king of sports.  St. Augustine is one of the most picturesque and interesting  little cities in America, and is the oldest European settlement  in the United States. It was founded by Phillip II of Spain  in 1565, and was a walled and fortified town during Spanish  occupation, but Old Fort Marion and the ancient city gates  are all that is left to tell the story of its heroic past. The old  town, with its quaint buildings and narrow streets, is an interesting contrast to the modern and fashionable city, with its broad  avenues, beautiful buildings and sumptuous hotels. The  climate of St. Augustine is bracing and delightful and is favored  by those who like an active outdoor life. Golf, tennis, motoring,  boating and fishing are the sports of this locality, and its luxurious  and richly appointed hotels are among the finest in the State.  Nowhere in the world can a hotel be found more appropriately designed and pleasing in its architectural style, for its  tropical setting and romantic atmosphere, than the Ponce  de Leon. Built of native shell rock, its embellishment and  decorations embody the history and traditions of the Spanish  occupation and the artistic feeling brought over from old Spain.

The climate is delightful throughout the Winter and a prolonged stay on the Island is a continuous pleasure.  Probably the most popular tropical trip, just now, is to  Panama, and the new route to the Canal is by the "Oversea  Railroad" to Key West, thence via steamship Evangeline of  the Peninsular & Occidental Steamship Company to Colon,  Kingston, Jamaica and Havana—making a two weeks' cruise,  and giving ample opportunity to visit the places of interest on  the Isthmus and the cities of Cristobal and Panama. Returning, a stop of two days is allowed at Kingston, the capital and  principal city of Jamaica, with an opportunity for a trip on the  island.

By way of the lines north of Jacksonville, through all-  Pullman car trains are operated between New York and the East  Coast points, St. Augustine, Ormond, Palm Beach, Miami and  Key West. The New York trains leave terminals daily, one via  each of two routes, the Seaboard Air Line and the Atlantic  Coast Line, making two special trains per day each way between  New York and all East Coast resorts.  Through Pullman cars are operated daily between Chicago  and Palm Beach via the " Dixie Flyer" Route, the Southern  Railway and "Seminole Limited" Route.

For all these priceless ingredients — no charge except transportation.  To help you enjoy these gifts to the utmost, Miami has provided comfortable, modern, complete city living at prices no higher — and often  lower — than those prevailing in your "home town".  Just as a finishing touch, Miami has added more fun and thrills than  any comparable area has ever provided.  These are the things for which people come to Miami. They have  helped Miami to become a unique national institution — a tropic playground for all America — in an astonishingly short time.  You are rightfully entitled to a share in the gifts of America's  Miami.   There  are  plenty  to  go  'round.   This  booklet will outline them briefly — and show how easy they are to enjoy.

They  do not record any overcoats, snow7, sleet, furnace smoke, icy pavements, ear muffs, coughs or sneezes. This is because  of such U. S. Weather Bureau winter "averages" as air, 68.2°; surf, 70°. The all-year average temperature is 75.2°.  There are no cold waves to induce respiratory ailments.   The sun shines 359 days in 365.  Miami's summer climate picture is "beautiful," too.   There has never been a heat wave.   The thermometer goes  above 90° on an average of only five days each  year. The ocean trade winds, blowing steadily  about 9 m. p. h., have made a great summer resort of Miami. This is a pleasant paradox which  puzzles but pleases thousands of wise vacationists.

You can go on boat rides, run and climb and swing in modern playgrounds,  go to nice schools, (many with outdoor classes) in which you can pick up  your studies right where you left off. You can eat garden-fresh vegetables in  all seasons. They're extra-full of the minerals and vitamins that make you  strong. And the Miami sun will turn you so brown those pale people back  home will hardly know you.  If you're around the corner either way from sixty-ish, your "playgrounds"  will be Miami's beautiful parks, with shuffleboard, roque, horseshoes, checkers,  chess — and plenty of comfortable palm-shaded seats. You'll meet hundreds  of fine people of your own age — perhaps at the unique Threescore and Ten  Club. You'll visit the fine City and County parks and beaches.

They'll probably want to see the mysterious Everglades, visit  a Seminole Indian village, drive along the fabulous Keys via the "highway that goes to sea", take a look at the various "millionaires' rows",  have an air view of the city, zip across Biscayne Bay in a speedboat.  They will visit their State Clubs and attend the gay Civic Centre dances.  They can participate in Miami's many-sided cultural life -J- or just relax  in a deck chair beneath a Gumbo Limbo tree.

And if your own  yard isn't spacious enough,  Miami provides A mericas  most impressive "front yard"  for all her visitors — the  $7,000,000 Bayfront Park  whose bench-lined promenades, palm-fringed avenues  and riotous flower gardens  stretch across the city's entire  downtown   area. 		image/tiff						76585668 Bytes	4731	5396	3482052737	RGB	8	600	asc99990000310010001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1305	1305	1306.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1306.jp2

And   \  just   about   every   seawall,   causeway,   dock   and  bridge carries its quota of ambitious anglers.  so on and so on. After dark you'll enjoy the smartest,  smoothest entertainment America provides. All the big  names of the footlights and spotlights pop up in Miami  every so often.

Or the country's  top-ranking golfers in the $10,000 Miami Open and other big-time events? There are headline tennis and swimming  tournaments, too — boxing and wrestling matches — dozens of sail and power regattas, headed by the Lipton Cup and  Miami-Nassau races. Greyhound racing, the Orange Festival and other pageants, the skeet tournaments, the Jai Alai  games, the Miami All-American Air Maneuvers -— the big-league baseball of the Grapefruit Circuit — are just items  among the thousand and one headline-making sports spectacles for which Miami is the world's greatest "grandstand"  every year.  HTke d^&Catonial diaci££u& C\Mlii (E*lfe HAaU The visitor to Miami hears about, reads about,  eats and sees fish — gigantic, tiny, spotted, striped, plain and fancy ones. Inevitably he or she soon wets a line  from shore or boat. All-of-a-sudden something yanks the rod. The reel screams, the rod bends and vibrates. The  angler's eyes pop, his wrist grows numb. The "fishing bug" has got him. Few escape this happy, thrilling, peculiarly  Miamian infection. Most cases last a lifetime. The world's finest and largest fleet of deep sea fishing cruisers provides guides, bait and special tackle for sailfish, marlin, dolphin, tarpon, bonito, wahoo and the other giants. Excellent  shops have everything you need for snook, bass, bonefish, chiro,   bream,  snapper,   grouper,   yellowtail,   etc.    Tackle  needn't be expensive. You can fish ocean, bay  or inland waters in a hundred different ways for  some 650 finny fighters. Maybe you'll win a  prize in the Metropolitan Miami $10,000 Fishing  Tournament, or in the new Summer Tournament.  About 250,000 try every year.  IWeekly sailing regattas feature Miami Yacht  Club calendars. But it's more in the Miami mood  to just "pick up and go sailing" — over shimmering tropic waters — flecked with sunshine or moonlight according  to  when the notion strikes you. 		image/tiff						76585668 Bytes	4731	5396	2276671481	RGB	8	600	asc99990000310011001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1306	1306	1307.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1307.jp2

The former, especially, draws  thousands of sightseers even when the  horses aren't running.  HA/kene ^a&klori ^iniktk cme  OjLOTin Miami's many smart shops and department stores have assumed unquestioned  national leadership in sports and resortwear.  So there's a practical angle for those who  wait and "shop on arrival". Their wardrobes  are not only ultra-ultra while they're here—  but they're sure of being months ahead of  fashion trends when they return home.  ^Ood ^Jon tke Spirit Don't get  the idea that Miami is all "fluff". Her cultural fare is rich and complete. America's  finest musicians come each year to play and  sing the world's great music. Many appear  in concert with University of Miami's phenomenally successful Symphony Orchestra.  Music clubs flourish. Many fine exhibitions of painting and sculpture are shown in Miami galleries. Lectures and other presentations are arranged by  the University of Miami and other organizations. Distinguished theatre groups present repertories of plays annually.  The public libraries have broad selections. Miami's fast-growing Latin-American colony provides opportunity for  pleasant social intercourse and stimulating "good-neighborly" discussion. The public and private schools rank with  the nation's best.   The city's friendly churches extend a cordial welcome.  Som.ettm.e4 HfkeU ^Don't Go diack Many who think they can "take Miami or let it alone" find  that suddenly or gradually the sunshine has crept into their hearts. This began happening around 1900, when the  town boosters were shooting at a population of 6,000. By 1940 over 170,000 people were living here permanently.  Thousands more are establishing residences in Miami as the years march along — building homes, taking their places  in the richly satisfying life of the community. For them Miami's top-flight architects and builders are ready with  ideas, plans or completed houses exemplifying a breathtaking new style created to fit a new kind of living.

Miami is sleek, streamlined, shining new —  America's closest approach to the ultra-modern, architecturally-perfect "city of tomorrow."  As the largest U. S. airport of entry and the chief  air and ocean gateway to and from the West Indies,  Central and South America, Miami greets this nation's  visitors from the south with a beautiful civic picture in  which everyone may take pride.  For U. S. people her tropic, "South Seas" panorama in green, gold, blue and white has a heart-catching appeal  that never lets loose, once you've felt its magic charm.  Miami's man-made and natural beauty, her temperate health-building climate and her amazing assembly of  ways to relax and play have given America a happy, carefree new scheme of life she has long needed — and needs  today even more definitely than in the past.  Remember, always, that Miami belongs to all America — and that there is no good reason why you should not  share fully in its beauty, fun and relaxation this year. By every "yardstick," it's  "Truly Yours — Miami!"  We are enclosing up-to-the-minute programs for Miami's current sports and recreational events, and detailed information on rates and "cost of living" generally, to  help you in making final plans for YOUR Miami vacation.

TUxt £&gt;ocm Un Moan* and .DoMcuiA  Today it is as easy and quick to come to Miami from  your home city as it used to be to travel across a couple  of counties. We'll illustrate with New York, Cleveland,  Chicago and St. Louis. They're from 1325 to 1447 miles  from Miami by car — a two days' drive over perfect  roads if you're in a hurry.  If you're in a BIG hurry you can fly. You'll do it in  from 8 to 11 hours; and Miami plane schedules are as  frequent as they are fast. The streamliners and other  crack trains serving Miami will breeze you down here in  a day and night or slightly more — in air-conditioned  comfort. Today's smooth-rolling buses will bring you  through, fresh and unruffled, in a little over 36 hours  from these four cities. And we needn't dwell on the  delights of the coastwise steamship cruise — a little  longer, but with dancing, flying fish and Gulf Stream  to compensate.  The transportation people are making things still  easier with more and more travel bargains. Ask your  local ticket agent or travel agency about them.  An amusing feature of your trip (if you come in  winter) will be the contrast between your departure, all  bundled up against the cold, and your arrival in the  sunshine, with your coat on your arm and a smile on  your face.  Co&t& H'kat Smlfle a  HA/etfeome   We know where there's a beautiful room in dotted  Swiss, candlewick and matched maple, with gay "rag"  rugs on a polished floor. A gorgeous Hibiscus blooms  just outside one of the big windows. This room is yours  for a few dollars a week — and it's typical of thousands.  Down on the Bay there's a great estate like you see  in the movies — avenues of palms, private pool, putting  green, formal tropic garden, yacht dock, seven baths,  thirteen servants. You may have it for the season for a  few thousand dollars.  In between these two extremes are hundreds of fine  hotels, "ready to live in" apartments, houses and cottages, complete with furniture, linens, silver, everything.  These comfortable, attractive quarters are available at  rentals as low as those asked for comparable accommodations anywhere — rates that will prove a happy surprise if you've accumulated any wrong notions about  what it costs to live here. And there's plenty of room.  Miami has built at an astonishing clip for many years.  Miami's excellent restaurants, theatres, stores and other  establishments — many of them nationally-famed — will  give you the fullest of values for your money.  Fuel bills in Miami are negligible and clothing costs  are lower than elsewhere because of the climate. Winter  vegetables and fruits costs less because this is where  they're grown.  Amusements and other costs are average.  If you want more specific information, we'll be glad  to supply it in detail.

For the wallet-weary visitor these pages offer  moderately priced efficiency apartments, delightful hotel rooms...for the Sun Worshipper  of ample means, accommodations of Continental luxury and modern comfort. . . for the  wealthy visitor, palatial suites of king-like  splendor. Miami Beach is famed the world over  for its extensive accommodations. Whatever the  taste, wherever the location, whatever the atmosphere, whatever the price — it will be discovered among the superb collection offered  herein.  Locations of sponsors of this booklet appear  on the map in center spread.  The Miami Beach Chamber of Commerce  publishes each year a booklet to aid the resort-  curious in their selection of hotel and apartment  accommodations — this is the 1940-41 edition.  Won't you mention this publication when writing or wiring the hotels and apartment houses  appearing within these covers?  We hope your stay in Miami Beach will be  one of the most thrilling, pleasurable adventures  of your life . . . and we feel certain it will.  Lying alongside the rolling Atlantic like a  scintillating jeweled necklace, Miami Beach is  set deep in the American tropics — almost 300  miles farther south than Cairo, Egypt. Most cosmopolitan of New World resorts, this streamlined south sea island is ablaze with a fairyland  profusion of Spanish, French, Mediterranean  and modern architecture, spiced with inimitable  tropical beauty.  The island is linked to metropolitan Miami  by three  ribbon-like  causeways  across  limpid  Biscayne Bay, includes sixteen small man-made  islands, dotted with hotels, apartment houses,  pretentious estates and modest homes, is crisscrossed by calm Venetian waterways which wind  along palm-fringed roadways. Less than a mile  and one-half at its broadest point, the island  provides easy access to both ocean and bay.  Famed as a resort among resorts, Miami Beach  is renowned as a playground — dog racing, surf  and pool bathing, fashion shows, bicycling, yacht  and sailboat regattas, motoring, golfing on palm-  studded fairways, superb bay and deep sea fishing, tennis, sun bathing, boating, water sports,  horse racing tracks within a few miles, bowling,  park recreations, canoeing, modern first-run  theatres and the gay, throbbing nightlife that is  a thrilling blend of Broadway, South America  and the Continent.  Curricula of public and private schools at  Miami Beach are specially arranged for transfer-  adjustments, offering full academic credit with  a background of comfort and health. School  buildings are sun-conditioned, windows flung  wide-open to vitalizing sunlight and ocean  breezes — a healthful atmosphere of contentment conducive to undisturbed, enjoyable study.  Yet Miami Beach is a modern Southern city:  efficiently-operated hospitals, a complete library,  nine* churches, exclusive shops rivaling those of  the Rue de la Paix, daily-tested water supply,  public parks with lush tropical verdure, one of  the southeast's finest art galleries, municipal golf  courses, city-manager and councilmanic government, fully accredited schools, an extensive transportation system within the city and to Miami,  a bronzed corps of competent lifeguards, full  fire and police protection... all conveniences  of an up-to-date city, yet the charm and ease of  a southern resort city.  Old World charm ... New World convenience  ... tropical beauty and southern hospitality  this is Miami Beach!

Each year finds hundreds of yachts anchored in the  protected stretches of its waters. Multi-hued, and ever-changing, the waters range in color from the most  subtle shades of blue and green by day to the flooded radiance of silver, under a tropic moon by night.  Bordered by sloping sands and the dark green fronds of the Royal palms and coconut trees, the bay is indeed a perfect gem in a perfect setting; picturesque sailboats and high-powered speed boats skim its waves. On the breasts of its  waters go cargoes to many ports, while from its surface wing seaplanes to foreign countries only a short distance away.

Small wonder that Miami is  known universally as the Magic City.  Its progress has been substantial,  as evidenced by the well paved streets,  the solid architecture of its towering  buildings, its extensive commerce and  merchandising, the excellent quality  of its hotels and the financial standing  of its banking institutions. Yet with  ail this modern day evidences of  progress, Miami has retained the  colorful romance and youthful spirit  of a pioneer city.  In the decade of 1910 to 1920,  according to the United States census, Miami led the entire nation in percentage growth in population with a record breaking increase of 440 per cent, while Dade  County, of which Miami is the seat of government, led all the  counties with a 258 per cent increase.

The number of  summer visitors is increasing annually  as Miami's moderate summer climate  becomes better known. Tens of  thousands of vacation excursionists  were brought here during the past  summer by rail and ocean steamers.  Comparative  Statistics  Nothing so strikingly portrays the  astounding increase in population and  business activity that Miami has  enjoyed in recent years as a comparison of the building statistics of  the last five years. The building  of homes, apartments, hotels and  immense business structures has been  carried on at an amazing rate.  In 1921, the building permits for Greater Miami totalled $5,649,505;  in 1922, the total was $6,130,449; 1923, $11,388,866; 1924,  $30,795,504; 1925, $103,308,092; The first seven months of 1926,  $35,444,896.

The southernmost city in the United  States, Miami is further blessed by  Nature with a climate made equable  by the peninsular conformation of  the State and tempered in winter by  the warm current of the Gulf Stream  laving its shores.  Excessive heat is as scarce as frost  and the daily range of temperature is  so slight that the same weight of clothing is comfortable at midday as at  night.

Many of these visitors, who come to Miami for only a few  months become so intrigued with the charming homes, the health  providing climate and the ideal living conditions of Miami's  permanent population that they, too, decide to make Miami  their home.  m  Race-track Thronged Daily  Club-house   at   Race-track  Miami Jockey Club,  Hialeah  In the charming setting of tropical  foliage, even the most modest cottage  assumes an unusually picturesque  attraction, while the more pretentious  mansions seem gems of architectural  beauty in a background of exquisite  beauty.  Those who have chosen Miami as  their home have builded tastefully  and substantially a city that reflects  the home spirit in its many civic and  communal factors. An atmosphere  of contentment, refinement and culture creates a spell that binds anyone  that has known Miami close to its fold.  Many Splendid Schools  The coming generation requires  special consideration, in a city which  caters to the home and family life,  and in Miami every possible cultural  advantage has been developed. Dade  County has fifty-one schools, forty  of" which lie within the Miami  district, including a large Central High School in the center of the  city and the County Agricultural High School in the Little River  section, three large junior high schools and sixteen grammar  schools, one of which is the largest in the State.

In addition to the public schools,  Miami boasts many private schools of  national repute which give intensified  and specialized instruction. Conservatories of music and art, a military  academy, a college of commerce, a  parochial school and the advanced  courses at Miami University round  out an educational system that meets  every demand.  Greater Miami is fortunate in the  possession of Allison Hospital, endowed  by James A. Allison, pioneer resident of Miami Beach. This institution is located ideally on one of the  islands in Biscayne Bay in a restful  and beautiful setting and occupies  magnificent buildings with every modern scientific equipment for the comfort and well being of its patients.  A corps of surgeons and doctors, leaders in their profession, assure  the high standing of the   institution.

Several of the  church buildings rank among the  finest architecturally in the South,  and many millions of dollars are represented in those structures. Famous  pulpit orators serve as pastors of  many Miami churches, and fine pipe  organs, well directed choirs and  trained soloists offer the best in  church music.  Miami boasts the largest Sunday  School class in the world, inaugurated  by the late William Jennings Bryan.  Throughout the winter season, this  group meets every Sunday morning  in the cool shade of Royal Palm Park,  and has been an outstanding attraction to tourists. During the winter months, several religious conferences   are   held  with world-famed   Bible teachers in charge.

Sand was pumped from  the bottom of the bay to form a  70-acre stretch parallelling the shoreline of the city.  Beautified by expert landscape  gardeners with palms, sea-grape,  hibiscus and other tropical blooms,  the park is rapidly becoming a garden  spot   of   rare   anel   restful    beauty.  Yacht anchorages are a feature of  this park, the graceful craft at anchor  presenting a picturesque scene from  Bayshore Drive. The attractive Clubhouse of the historic Biscayne Bay  Yacht Club is situated in the park at  the mouth of the Miami River.  Royal Palm Park, a shady coconut  grove covering two city blocks, is renowned for its tropical splendor and  forms an ideal community center.  In the shade of the palms, twelve well-kept courts are arranged  for the devotees of horse-shoe throwing, and tables and benches  form a setting for checkers and chess, favorite pastimes among  many Miami  visitors.  In other parks of the city are tennis courts, roque courts, bowling  greens (declared the finest on the continent) and other facilities for  sport and recreation and also special  playgrounds for the children.  Spacious Pool, Deauville Casino  Water Sports, Roney-Plaza   Casino  Miami's Golf Offerings  Every day is golfing weather in  Miami, where eleven velvety courses  offer as irresistible magnets excellently  kept greens, sporty hazards, tropic  breezy, palm shaded rests, and complete, modern club-houses. Some are  near the ocean, some have winding  canals, some overlook a sweeping  river. Seasonal features are offered  to enable the visitor to take advantage  of these courses, which appeal to both  novice and professional through their  "different" environment.  Added zest to the ancient game is  imparted by the tournament play during the winter season by the pick of  the world's professionals for large  purses offered by the city. Interesting  championship tournaments for leaders  in the amateur ranks also attract large  galleries. These contests are usually  held in January, February and March.  Closest to town is the Miami Country Club, overlooking the Miami  River and adjacent to the cool Allapattah prairies. The velvety  Bermuda grass greens and the rolling layout of this course has gained  this club a reputation as one of the sportiest in the country. The  course is 18-hole, with a par of 72, and 6,250 yards. An attractive  club-house with wide verandas overlooking the course contributes  to its popularity.

Landscape  gardening has enhanced the prodigality of Nature in making this course of  exertional scenic attraction, and a large pool in connection with the  club-house allures golfers with the promise of a cooling plunge after their  game.    The course is 18-hole, 6,385 yards long, with a par of 75.  A nine-hole course at Coral Gables has as pleasant conjunction a unique  Spanish-Moorish club-house, where a palm-frilled dance floor in the patio  and an excellent cuisine prove especially attractive to golfing parties. The  course is 3,030 yards long with a par of 35.  The Miami-Hialeah Course, owned municipally, is situated on the edge  of the Everglades. The rich muck soil of the "glades" has produced a rich  grass course, supplemented by palms and tropical shrubbery. Artificial  hazards and traps designed by one of the most famous golf course experts  has made this course one of the most popular in the e'ountry. The length of  this 18-hole course is 6,275 yards with a par of 71. Another municipal  golf course is being constructed at Opa-Locka.  Miami Beach has its own quota of four seasoned golf courses, where one  can hit the little ball within view of the Atlantic or along cool inland canals.  These popular courses are the Flamingo, 9 holes, 3,080 yards; the Miami  Beach Golf Club, 18 holes, 6,101 yards; the Miami Beach Bay Shore Club,  18 holes, 6,000 yards and the new course, 18 holes, 6,420 yards. All the  courses have attractive, well-equipped club-houses in connection.  At Hollywood, a splendidly kept 18 hole course attracts many Miamians  to take a short trip for an occasional change. An up-to-date club-house  and dance floor affords opportunity for entertainment after the game.  "Let's Go Swimmin''  A far cry from the "ol' swimming hole" where one sneaked for the first  chilly swim in early Spring are the magnificent swimming pools and everyday surf bathing which Miami offers its water lovers. When the North is  shivering with ice and sleet, Miamians are climbing into their one-piece  suits for a dip in the waters warmed by the Gulf Stream which averages a  temperature of 72 degrees in midwinter.  The Two Million Dollar Causeway, with newly widened approaches,  and the new Venetian Way across Biscayne Bay brings the broad blue  Atlantic to Miami's front door. For miles along the shore stretches the  golden sand, palm-shaded, sloping seaward to the emerald green waves  which break on reefs far beyond and roll gently up on the beach.

Million Dollar Race-track  The hoarse shout, "They're Off!",  the colorful flash of the gay-coated  jockeys on slender thoroughbreds  about the long track, the thunder of  many fleet hoofs, the last gallant  efforts as the winner noses ahead at  the finish amid the clamor of thousands,—that is the thrill experienced  seven times daily during the racing  season in Miami at the magnificent  Allison Hospital million-dollar   Miami   Jockey    Club  Miami Beach track at Hialeah.  Thoroughbreds from the best stables in the country, ridden by the  gamest jockeys in the land make winter racing under summer skies  one of Miami's leading inducements in the realm of sports. The  club-house is rated among the foremost in America, set amid a  wealth of tropical landscaping and numbering on its membership  list the cream of America's social celebrities. Besides the exclusive club-house and the spacious concrete grand-stand, there is a  well-designed paddock with total accommodation for twenty thousand spectators and often it is filled to overflowing.

Sailing on America's Mediterranean  Watching Midwinter Regatta on  Biscayne Bay  Polo and Bridle Paths  Horse is crowned King in that most exciting of equine sports, the colorful  game of polo, enjoyed by all lovers of good horse-flesh and gameness. Polo  enthusiasts from all over the world meet each winter in Miami in outstanding contests. Four fine fields of thick turf with excellent stable  accommodations for the thoroughbreds are located at Miami Beach.  For the horse lover who delights in a daily canter there are many attractive bridle paths about Miami Beach, Hialeah and Coral Gables, where  blooded and well trained horses may be procured at reasonable rates from  reliable riding academies.  Fox hunting amid the palms and pines is one of the diversions the Miami-  Biltmore Country Club offers its members.  Exquisite Marine Gardens  The wonders of tropical foliage are not confined to the land about Miami,  for the surrounding waters boast marine gardens of exceptional loveliness.  A trip to the marvelous sea gardens of the reefs a few miles south of Miami  is made daily in glass-bottomed boats, providing an unforgettable afternoon  of unique entertainment.  As wonderful as a visit to King Neptune himself is the experience of  gazing through the clear waters at the rare beauties of sub-sea life. Amazing forests of giant coral jungles, of sea-fans and plumes, the deep purple  and crimson hues of which stand out vividly against the pure white sand  with its patches of blue and green sea-grass, hole! the eye like some strange  canvas.  What Shall We Do Tonight?  In Miami that familiar question takes the form more naturally,  "WThich shall we do to-night?", so many and varied are the forms of  amusement. After a day of strenuous outdoor exercise, golfing, swimming,  fishing or enjoying the thrill of the races, one would ordinarily feel a  little fatigued but so exhilarating is balmy winter air in Miami, that by dinner time one is ready to start on the evening whirl of gaiety.  If one is fortunate enough to be in Miami during the opera season, one  may enjoy nationally known artists in operatic triumphs. Last winter, the  Chicago Opera Company, headed by the incomparable Mary Garden, Rosa  Raisa, Charles Hackett, Edith Mason, Tito Ruffo and many other favorites, delighted music lovers with a week of opera.

Among them some of the most elaborate and unique theatres in the  country. For the devotees of Terpsichore, many dancing clubs offer excellent music by such famous orchestras as Max Fisher, Jan Garber, Paul  Whiteman, Arnold Johnson and other musical levaders. Exquisite dance  floors provide unusual entertainment in a magnificent setting. Among the  favorite night rendezvous of Miami are the Coral Gables Country Club,  where one dances on a palm-circled al fresco floor beneath the light of a  Florida moon; the Miami-Biltmore Country Club; the exclusive Embassy  Club on the Dixie Highway; the Lido on one of the picturesque islands in  the bay; the roof of the Columbus or Fleetwood Hotels overlooking Biscayne  Bay; the attractive Hollywood Country Club, where a sliding roof permits dancing under the sky; the deck, overlooking the ocean at the Hollywood Beach Hotel; the famous grille of the historic Royal Palm Hotel; in  fact the spacious ballrooms of any of the palatial hotels of the district and  the many interesting supper clubs ashore and afloat on yachts and house-  boats offer unique entertainment.  The tea dance has won a place for itself in the hearts of Miamians and  their winter visitors through the fact that it may be enjoyed under the  palms instead of confined to the usual indoor situation. After the day's  entertainment, what more intriguing and restful than a quiet gossip over  the Oolong with one's friends at a breeze swept shady table, interspersed  with a dance or so on the terrazzo dance floor. The Flamingo and Nautilus  tea-gardens overlooking the blue of Biscayne Bay at the Beach, the Royal  Palm gardens famous for their luxuriant tropical growth sloping down to the  bay; the broad porches and patios of the Miami-Biltmore Hotel and the  delightful sunken garden of the Venetian Casino where one is transported  to that far Italian city,—are but a few of the tea dance possibilities  Miami offers, each to fit one's me&gt;od.  Boasting as Miami does that here is the winter melting pot of the nation,  it is but natural that many of the residents from different States have  formed social organizations in which they may renew old friendships and  form new ones linked by the common bond of home State. These State  organizations are open to all visitors and offer many seasonal entertainment features, boating and motor parties, picnics, bacon roasts, dances and  theatre parties.  For a quiet evening's pastime, one may enjoy the concerts in the park  cooled by the breezes from the bay and artistically lit by the vari-colored  m§hmm  The Thrill of Aqua-Planing  Racing on Biscayne   Bay 	Text	image/tiff						78857385 Bytes	4749	5535	3224625753	RGB	8	600	asc99990000400030001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1408	1408	1409.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1409.jp2

S I N C E INCORPORATION IN  1896  /ear-Kound Comfort Some millions of years ago that  mysterious little marine creature, the coral, started building,  slowly out of warm salty depths, the tropical "tip" of that  magic peninsula which today we call Florida. On this coral  strand washed by the Atlantic has arisen one of the most unusual city groups in the world—Greater Miami, fl So much  has been said and written about climate that perhaps you're  bored with the subject. Perhaps it doesn't make any impression on you to read that Miami has a winter climate which  is from 10 to 20 degrees warmer than that of Nice, Rome,  Madrid, Cairo or Algiers ... a summer climate considerably  cooler than the rest of the United States. These are facts  which the United States Weather Bureau will verify, but  then statistics are dry reading to the average person and  therefore not impressive, fl What is impressive, however, is  your own physical comfort when you are in this amiable  spot. In winter, the ache in your bones and the chill in your  flesh which the northern weather induces are dissipated immediately in the soft warm atmosphere of this lovely Miami.  In summer, the heat weariness you experience in stuffy cities  of the North is not felt here, because of the continual cool  winds that stream in from the sea. Sounds like a Gilbert-and-  Sullivan paradox, doesn't it? But—as George Bernard Shaw  will testify—paradoxes are sometimes true. Miami—if you  want this paradox explained—enjoys an oceanic instead of  continental climate, fl Greater Miami's average annual range  between the warmest and coolest months is 14.4 degrees!  That's a clue to the comfort of our climate throughout the  year. Southeastern Florida has no extremes in temperature  or humidity ... a high percentage of sunshine (359 days  a year) . . . adequate rainfall (most in September) . . . and  an atmosphere uncontaminated by dust, smoke or obnoxious gases.

When the thermometer gets down to 50,  Miamians think a cold wave has hit them. In the past 34  years freezing has been recorded seven times. Miami has  only one day a year when the temperature averages below  60 degrees . . . and only four days a year when the temperature reaches 90 or more. Average January temperature  in Miami is the same as average June temperature in Atlantic city. And as for Miami summers — there has never  been a case of heat prostration. Remember the terrific heat  wave which swept the country last summer? During all that  period, Miami was delightfully cool . . . thanks to the constant ocean breezes that blow every hour, day and night.  Ask those who spent their vacations here! fl Today thousands of people are recapturing their vital forces—finding  youth—throughout the length and breadth of Dade County  —whether in the playtime activities of Miami and Miami  Beach or in the occupational interests of the Redlands and  Hialeah sections. Here's an El Dorado infinitely richer than  the golden city of Voltaire's imagination. Here are the priceless treasures of happiness and health — a golden sunny  abundance—ready for everyone to take to himself, fl There  must be wisdom in coming to Miami, because the world's  most respected minds come here. This is the rendezvous of  celebrities. Miami and its sister cities attract during the year  more celebrated people from all departments of life than  any other resort in the country. Leaders in the professions,  arts, sciences, commerce, finance, politics and sports assemble in this lovely scene every winter to enjoy the diversions,  the opportunities for relaxation and the companionship of  stimulating intellects, fl However, an important fact about  this fascinating sub-tropic zone of happiness is that it attracts not only the wealth of the continent, but it holds a  gracious hospitality for the average man and woman, old or  young, in moderate circumstances.  woo  MOTORIZED GONDOLAS ARE POPULAR 	Text	image/tiff						78070518 Bytes	4789	5434	296373805	RGB	8	600	asc99990000420006001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1420	1420	1421.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1421.jp2

Elaborate tests  given throughout a period of years have demonstrated that  these rays have a rejuvenating and curative effect on wasted  tissues of the human body, to which many of the ills that  come are directly traceable. A doctor's first instruction concerning the care and cure of ailing persons is: "Give them  plenty of fresh air and sunshine." He knows that few medicines will do the work as efficiently and surely as the sun.  Cures are not the only accomplishments of ultra-violet rays.  They have a strengthening effect on the entire system, making it disease resistant. A strong person has a much more  than even chance in battling the many ailments to which the  flesh is heir, fl The white light of the sun is composed of  numerous rays which vary in intensity and color . . . from  the infra-red heat rays on one side of the spectrum, to the  ultra-violet chemical rays on the other. All have their effect  on the human organism, but it is upon the ultra-violet ray  GET OUT AND GET UNDER THE  SUN  that the greatest attention of physicians has been centered.  This has been proved to be the most elusive, most easily dissipated and most easily deflected .... in its course from the  sun to the earth. The ultra-violet ray will not penetrate  clothing; nor a cloudy, dusty and smoky atmosphere. Nor  will it pass in all its effectiveness through any type of window pane. The greater the angle it must take in its course  from the sun to the earth, the lower its penetration and concentration. For this reason the localities nearest the sun,  where the rays maintain a more direct focus, obtain the  greatest benefits, fl Southeastern Florida projects far down  into sub-tropic seas. Its skies are blue and clear and its air  is pure. There is no location on the mainland of the United  States where the atmosphere is clearer ... or as free of dust,  smoke or other foreign substances in the air. Greater Miami  is the most admirably situated city group in this area or in  the entire country, summer and winter, for heliotherapy  (sun cure).

Thus the advantages for  "sun-bathing" are obvious, particularly so when the baths  may be enjoyed during winters, in an average temperature  of 72 degrees, fl Sunshine performs three indispensable  functions in the protection of children. It takes the place of  Vitamin "D" in building healthy bones, teeth, muscles,  nerves and other tissues requiring lime, thus safeguarding  the child against rickets. It also increases the red corpuscles  of the blood, the function of which is to carry to the tissues  the oxygen necessary to produce the physical energy. Thus  the sun works to prevent and cure enemia. This area protects  the child against contagion, too, because it permits the proper amount of fresh air. In the North, hot, dry, artificially-  heated school rooms are the worst source of children's ailments, not only because the close, dry air imprisons bacteria  of contagious maladies, especially diphtheria, but because it  dries the respiratory tracts of the child, rendering him more  susceptible to colds and other common illnesses which so  often lead into pneumonia. This district is the healthiest  place in the United States for children. Here you find naturally ventilated school rooms; open air classes; sunny, supervised playgrounds.

For Hay Fever» Miami in Summer Time    Miami  scores again as a desirable place to spend the summer, especially for the thousands of Americans who are afflicted  with hay fever, or pollinosis, caused by ragweed pollen.

Of course it's difficult to believe ardent fishermen, when  they say that, but when cold-minded scientists confirm it,  you can't dispute it very successfully, fl Anglers going after  the big stuff in the deep waters have at their service as fine  a fishing fleet as they'll find anywhere in the seven seas . . .  seaworthy boats, equipped with all necessary tackle, comfortable and mobile for the strategies of big game-fish conflicts, fl At the Miami city docks alone there are moored 50  Gulf Stream trolling boats, 3 deep-sea fishing yachts, 10 excursion boats and 6 houseboats for charter on cruises among  the Florida keys. In Miami Beach there is the Miami Beach  Rod and Reel Club with complete equipment for all types  of fishing. The captains are all expert navigators and seasoned fishermen, who know the habits and habitats of the  under-water heavyweights, as well as the other finny fighters.  The Miami Beach Rod and Reel Club and The Miami An  glers Club now offer membership to visitors for the duration  of their stay, fl If you've never felt that titanic, impudent  energy when a marlin, sailfish, tarpon, barracuda, bonito,  dolphin, wahoo, or amber jack hits your hook and takes it  for a 100-yard dash, you just don't know what excitement  is. Out there in the Gulf Stream swims a challenge to any  man's strength, courage and angling skill, fl Perhaps you or  your wife may prefer a quieter type of fishing. There are  many boats to take you out to the reefs or down the bay to  peaceful nooks, where you can do bottom fishing for the  beautiful little fellows that taste so good when fried in  butter. In the canals and rivers of this area fresh water  black bass, perch and other varieties abound. The fellow  who likes casting for 'em can get his basket full of bass,  up the Miami River, out along the Tamiami Trail Canal or  in nearby ponds and lakes easily accessible by motor.

S. Department of Commerce adopted  a national code which closely parallels the Miami ordinances. Aviation is considered of such importance in  Miami that a municipal department was created for it. Lots  of red tape and delays have been avoided by this sensible  plan of placing aviation directly under the city fathers, who  have always been prompt to act on projects for the expansion of aviation here, fl The City of Miami maintains a  municipal airport, a municipal seaplane base on Biscayne  Bay and a municipal dirigible airport with a hangar for  , accommodating the Goodyear blimps. The municipal airport is thoroughly equipped for night flying and is kept  lighted from sunset to sunrise. For seaplanes there is a  protected area extending fifteen miles in Biscayne Bay.  There are four other airports and seaplane bases, maintained by private companies. The second largest seaplane  base on the Atlantic Coast was built by the Curtiss-Wright  Flying Service, close to the downtown area of Miami. flEast-  ern Air Transport, Inc., operating from Miami to the North,  brings all cities of the East and Middle West to within one  day's journey of Miami.

Here is the operating base for 22,000 miles of air  and passenger lines, fl The Miami All American Air Races,  which for three years have been the leading winter aviation event in the United States, will be held January 7,  8 and 9. This years program will be larger than ever before. It will be the occasion for dedicating a new dirigible  base.  Industries Local raw materials and those from Latin  America are available at minimum cost. Plants to handle  this trade will save time, labor and transportation costs by  locating here. Miami's hard surfaced highways, well equipped  railways  and  steamship  lines  and  airplane   facilities  guarantee good service to industry. Power can be supplied  at satisfactory costs to industries. Good labor conditions  and favorable weather reduce construction costs to a minimum. With sickness, fuel and heavy clothing expenses  almost eliminated and with desirable living conditions,  thousands of employees desire to make their permanent  homes in Miami. Approximately 250 industrial plants are  operating in Greater Miami. We still need distribution  warehouses for Latin American trade, canneries, manufactories of hosiery, undergarments, bathing suits, cigars, furniture, shoes, fertilizer; oil refinery; paper mill and box  plant; aviation equipment and aircraft.

Page 22																																	asc9999000042	asc99990000420022001		Agricultural Dade County The available lands of  Dade County present most attractive opportunities. There  are many contributing factors. The county contains a city  group of the first magnitude, noted throughout the world  as a resort, and visited by thousands yearly. These people  must be fed and they are of discriminating tastes, demanding and expecting the best in fruits, vegetables, fowls and  berries, fl Within a forty-mile radius of Miami there are a  number of farms with a yearly turnover of $100,000 or  more. They are diversified in nature and produce in quantities beans, tomatoes, potatoes, milk and by-products . . .  or combinations of truck and dairy products. The developments are so large and highly important that they rank  with the major industries of Greater Miami, with payrolls  that directly benefit all business. There are a number of  canneries and preserving plants establishing trade-names  and canning vegetables and fruits under attractive labels.  II The visitor to Greater Miami during the winter season  is assured of fine locally grown vegetables and fruits. Out-  of-season commodities produced in Dade County may be  procured in cans or glass, newly packed and of high quality. Epicures browsing in the curb market will find many  satisfying delicacies at all times . . . and at prices that  compare favorably with those of other parts of the country. Baby milk, a scientifically approved pure food for  babies, children and people who are dieting, is purveyed  by certified dairies. Comparisons with the dairies in other  sections of the country are much in our favor, fl Topographical location and equable climate make it possible  to produce here many fruits and vegetables in winter,  when northern fields are blanketed with snow ... a most  lucrative period for our growers. This alone is a logical  reason for farmers to locate here, but there are others of  outstanding importance, such as: advantageous transportation facilities (rail, motor truck on highly-improved  highways, canals from interior to coast, and by sea in  refrigerated steamers) ; three farm and vocational schools  now in successful operation; efficient County Agricultural  Agents, who advise planters on questions of soil, time for  planting, successful growing and marketing; the Home  Demonstration Department, that has solved in great part  the utilization of cull fruits, the canning and preserving  of all kinds of food stuff, and feminine instruction in this  work. Also important is the new tariff act giving protection against foreign products, fl Immediate opportunity  exists for Dade County farmers, in the local market itself.  To feed Greater Miami for the year ending June 30th,  1930, three thousand, one hundred and sixty carloads of  food were shipped in. Some of it came from adjacent  counties, some from the state at large, and some from the  packing houses of the county. Three hundred and ninety  seven carloads of potatoes were imported. One hundred  and ninety-six carloads of watermelons means that the  production is far behind consumption. Seventy-seven carloads of live and dressed poultry were sent into this  county, where housing facilities are almost unnecessary  in successful production ... at any rate inexpensive.  There are many other items easily produced that were  shipped in by car lots. The figures above do not include  food shipped in by chain stores.  ***&gt;-   ^•■'w  DADE COUNTY  BOASTS  SPLENDID  DAIRIES  ABOVE—AVOCADOES!

YOU KNOW THE JELLY—THY THE FRUIT  ABOVE, BEANS, A PROLIFIC WINTER CROP  Exports However, Dade County exports much more  than it imports and all from a fraction of available agricultural lands at the peak of the production season. The  key to this operation lies in the relatively high prices obtained tor almost everything in winter crops. For instance, more than six hundred carloads of grapefruit were  shipped last season into a market that could easily absorb  sucn huge shipments of fruit. The product of 5,100 acres  of tomatoes went in great part to the canneries, catsup  makers and other wholesale consumers of the north.  Dairy Products In milk production the county almost  meets the consumption. We have three certified dairies,  which probably surpass any county in the State of Florida. We have what is generally acknowledged to be the  most complete and finest equipped dairy in the South.  It is known as the world's largest individually-owned  dairy, fl Soil types are suited to grasses, cane, corn, and  other forage crops. Most of the feed is put down in silos.  Thus, despite the season, a supply of forage is always on  hand, fl Poultry is another valuable product that is not  meeting local consumption. The Metropolitan Miami area  raises less than one per cent of the eggs consumed here.  /OUr Farm is Here There are soil types of varied  character in Dade County. The muck lands are well known  as producers of vegetables, feed crops and sugar cane. It  is a moot question as to the kind of soil that produces  most of the high quality vegetables grown in the district.  There is one kind ... a surprising type ... a soft limestone formation on which our biggest groves are planted.  Preparing this land calls for scarifying and levelling off,  but when ready its production possibilities are undoubted  for tropical and subtropical fruits. There are pine lands  and sands of varying quality, from sandy loam to the  almost pure silicate, in which pineapples are best grown.  fl There is a fertility to the soil in Dade County that  gives the farmer a chance to make good on a very small  acreage.  Crop Opportunities The planting calendar in the  office of the County Agricultural Agent shows a way to  harvest some crop money from Dade County soils every  month in the year. It has been prepared by the United  States Department of Agriculture, fl Fruit growing is  county-wide but the heaviest production is in the center  and south portions. Homestead, a modern city in the south  end of the county, is the "capital" of the agricultural  sections, with big packing-houses for tomatoes, vegetables  and fruits. West of the railroad and running south from  Goulds is the famous "Redlands" district, which produces  practically every type of tropical and subtropical fruit  grown in the United States . . . and some grown nowhere  else, fl A portion of the Everglades lies on the western  side of Dade County. Some of these lands are under water  for a portion of the year. Much of it has been drained and  is admirably suited to farming. The Everglades, as a  whole, are rich lands which will be extensively developed 	Text	image/tiff						78357858 Bytes	4789	5454	21810179	RGB	8	600	asc99990000420023001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1437	1437	1438.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1438.jp2
Page 24																																	asc9999000042	asc99990000420024001		as drainage becomes more general. There are rich "marl  pockets," however, that extend from the Everglades in  some instances completely across the county. These pockets, although subject to overflow for a part of the year,  produce heavily in tomatoes, beans, peppers and other  vegetables. They might prooerly be called "delta lands",  fl The farmer is assured of good roads throughout the  county. No long hauls are necessary. Even a large portion  of the Everglades has good rock roads. Everything possible has been done to facilitate the grower's operations  and to aid in his success. Dade County's educational system is modern and extensive. The best of schools are  ready for the children, with transportation by buses to  and from every village in the area.  Horticulture Oranges, grapefruit and limes have been  grown here for a long time . . . yes, long before Miami  obtained its charter. Limes were always successful here  and probably always will be. Thousands of acres of  sturdy orange and grapefruit groves can be seen throughout the county. Owing to the favorable climate, they ripen  early and have the advantage of being in the market when  prices are high. "Key" limes even grow wild in the rocky  soils in this part of the state. They require little or no  cultivation. The bulk of the crop comes from the Florida  "keys" or islands. The fruit is round and weighty in juice  content. Other varieties, most amenable to cultivation,  are doing well. This particular part of Florida is the biggest shipping point for limes in the United States.  I ropiCal rruits Avocados and mangoes, probably not  so well known as citrus fruits, have found their natural  home in Dade County. There is not a ten-acre grove of  mangoes in all Florida. Yet this rare delicacy is easily  grown here. At present they are planted most widely for  ornamental purposes. Altogether there are about 75 acres  of them in the county. The mango, however, is finding a  growing market, and intelligent merchandising promises  to make it one of the most readily accepted commercial  fruits, fl The avocado is a balanced ration. It contains  everything necessary to sustain life (ask your doctor) in  such nutritive balance that the most delicate stomach  can digest them. It is the king of salad fruits, and its tree  is highly ornamental. It is looked upon as one of the  world's big money makers as consumer education widens  its market. A great deal of painstaking experimentation  has settled commercial growing of avocados on the following varieties: early types, Pollock and Trapp; mid-  season, and three of the Guatemalan varieties, fl From the  number of beautiful and delicious . . . and new . . . fruits  being grown at this time in Greater Miami one is inclined  to ask: "What fruits ten years hence?" A reasonable  doubt may be raised as to whether anything can be produced that will take the place of the apple, pear or peach.  Just to start the argument, if there is to be one, it is well  to mention the work being done at the Plant Introduction  Garden conducted by government scientists, just below 	Text	image/tiff						78357858 Bytes	4789	5454	1714151724	RGB	8	600	asc99990000420024001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1438	1438	1439.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1439.jp2
Page 25																																	asc9999000042	asc99990000420025001		Miami. This section and climate have been adjudged  ideal for these important experiments. The government is  "saying it with fruits": fruits that are diets for certain  physical conditions, fruits that are full meals in themselves, fruits that delight the sense of taste. Seldom does  an exotic fruit tree . . . and the government is combing  the tropics for them . . . perform at once satisfactorily  for the scientists. The tree may flourish, flower and bear,  but there is something lacking; or too abundant; maybe  too much or too little acid; unbalanced sugar content;  size wrong; or color unattractive. The scientist "takes  hold" and the plant or tree is "tailored" to fit the new  environment and improvement begins, fl These fruits  cannot be grown successsfully everywhere but they are  thriving in the Plant Introduction Garden in Greater  Miami ... in commercial and private tropical gardens  . . . and in some of the hothouses of the county. The  fruits, other than those mentioned, are: Monstera delici-  osa, Kaffir orange, sapodilla, sugar apple, tamarind, Surinam cherries, bread fruit, annona, carissa, date calamon-  drin, kumquat, guava and fig. These are just some of the  better known types. There are many others, fl Ranking  with the avocado, and perhaps exceeding it in future  interest, is the papaya. The papaya is a tree melon and  one of the choicest fruits the tropics produce. It is grown  only in a small area of South Florida. From its skin to  its seeds, its various parts are credited with medicinal  value. Pepsin is one of its most important by-products.  Large shipments are now going into the North to be used  in candies, marmalade, ice cream and as a fruit melon.  Its demand is steadily increasing as it becomes more  familiar in northern markets. Growers now are confronted not with a problem of marketing, but wTith a  problem of meeting the demand. The tree bears within  ten months to a year and produces from one hundred  to four hundred pounds of fruit. Local growers are realizing from three to six cents a pound for their output.  Visitors to this section are advised to watch for the papaya tree as a curiosity and investigate it as a profit opportunity. The papaya is destined to become one of the  country's most popular fruits and a valuable ingredient  for palatable and healthful drinks, as well as many other  products requiring a high pepsin content, fl In short,  Agricultural Dade County offers the visitor much from  the standpoint of sightseeing interest, and unmeasured  opportunity from the standpoint of profit. The retired  business man of the North will find Dade County's various agricultural sections and pursuits a profitable recreation; the farmer will find a winter-time vocation to which  he can give his attention profitably during his own  northern "off season.'' Here is a land of proven farm  worth . . . yet practically untapped when its resources  are considered ... a land worthy of investigation.

This peninsula divides the waters  of the Gulf of Mexico from the waters of the  Atlantic; around its tip flows the warm Gulf Stream  to lave the sun-gilt, surf-washed, golden-sanded  beaches. At the southeastern tip of Florida is the  tropical metropolis of the United States, the City  of Miami, with its thriving suburban communities  of Miami Beach, Coral Gables, Coconut Grove,  Hialeah, and Miami Springs. In the latter is located  the great health-building institution, the Miami-  Battle Creek, patterned after the world-renowned  Battle Creek Sanitarium in Michigan.  The Miami-Battle Creek was  founded in 1930 by the late Dr^  John Harvey Kellogg. The original building was constructed as a hotel during the  Florida boom days by the late Mr. Glenn Curtiss,  of airplane fame. Convinced that the Battle Creek  way of health was fundamentally sound, Mr. Curtiss  presented this property to Dr. Kellogg, who straightway dedicated it to health, race betterment, and  human welfare. Since that time the buildings have  been enlarged and the grounds  beautified, until today the  Miami-Battle Creek is recognized as one of the beauty  spots of Florida, as evidenced  by the photographs throughout this brochure.  And what more appropriate  site could be had for an institution which finds in the  rejuvenating effects of Florida's superpotent sunshine the  Fountain of Youth, Ponce de  Leon failed to find ? Where in  all continental United States  is there such a balmy, tropical  clime as Southern Florida?  Miami is 553 miles nearer the  equator than Los Angeles,  and is even 320 miles farther  south than Cairo, Egypt.  Warmed by the 72 ° Gulf  Stream, Miami is "where  winter spends the summer."  SPACIOUS  AND  BEAUTIFUL  GROUNDS  Guests at the Miami-Battle Creek visiting, relaxing, and  doing "fancy work" in the sunshine of the garden patio  beside the lily pool.  Surf bathing at Miami Beach is as comfortable and  enjoyable in winter as at Atlantic City in summer.  Constantly fanned by the cool southeast Trade  Winds, Miami is a summer resort for Georgia and  Alabama. Sultry days and sunstroke are unknown;  the summer temperature seldom reaches 90 degrees,  and has never exceeded 94.  The grounds of the Miami-  Battle Creek are studded  with tall Royal, Washing-  tonian, coconut and other graceful palms and flowering shrubs. During the winter months gorgeous  poinsettias and hibiscus of various hues, with broad  well-kept lawns for a background, make a brilliant  display. The outer walls of the main building and  the porches are decorated with vivid bougainvilleas  and flame vines, with air plants and orchids from  the Florida Everglades.  The unique garden patio is a popular rendezvous  for the guests. It is made attractive by rare exotic  plants and trees, a tall pandanus with screw-like  foliage from the South Seas, the traveler's palm,  which provides life-saving water for desert wanderers, a pool, into which a little brook trickles,  schools of tropical fish of  mmmmmmmmmmmmi many colors and fantastic  shapes and a variety of aquatic plants.  The main building is constructed so that it gives every  room a sunny exposure. Many  of the rooms are supplied with  a sun porch, or fresh-air sleeping room. Each room has a  private bath and telephone.  To be sure, the Miami-Battle  Creek is not a hotel but a great  health institution, but nevertheless, its appointments and  service are those of a first-class  hotel.  The Miami-Battle Creek is  withal an ideal place to rebuild one's strength and to  learn the way to superhealth.  A new regimen for living —  that's what one finds at the  Miami-Battle Creek.

It in no way  suffices that a person go to his doctor for physical checkups unless that person alters his habits  and follows a program of living whichN conduces to health. The betterment of health by  means of a scientific health regimen is what the  under par people of our land need more than  any other one thing.  When one comes to the Miami-Battle Creek,  he enters a school of healthful living. Every physician, nurse, dietitian, and technician in the institution is always ready to instruct the guests in  the fundamental principles of health. Wrong habits of eating, sleeping, posture and exercise are  corrected, and every feature of conduct relating  to physical health is emphasized.  In a compartively short time, appetite and digestion improve, blood  cells increase, and other evidences  of better nutrition become markedly  apparent. The patient feels and  looks better.  The renewal of "pep" and vigor  by the removal of unnecessary burdens from the liver, kidneys, and  other defensive organs, the increasing of the natural healing and  restorative functions of the body  by correction of faulty posture  and disease-promoting attitudes of  mind and body, — these are all important features  of the health program.  Seventy years ago, Battle Creek treatments were  less popular than now; but these physical and physiologic methods are now recognized as the most  powerful and efficient of all means of promoting  health and combating disease through improving  metabolism, aiding digestion, encouraging blood-  building and circulation, and otherwise activating  and reenforcing the natural disease-resisting and  healing powers of the body.  Because Battle Creek was a pioneer in the development of scientific physiotherapy in this country, its methods have become widely known as the  "Battle Creek Methods." The chief credit due  Battle Creek is for having been first to bring together in a correlated system the various forms  of physical and physiologic treatment and appliances, combined  with a carefully regulated and  balanced biologic diet. Only by  combining in a scientific manner  all health-promoting measures is  the attainment of the best results  possible.  The Miami-Battle Creek lays special stress upon regimen therapy  and makes use of all recognized  curative measures, aiming to give  relief by combating causes, and by  the use of various highly potent non-  medicinal   methods   which   rarely 		image/tiff						91605699 Bytes	4729	6457	4059042948	RGB	8	600	asc99990000090004001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1448	1448	1449.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1449.jp2

By these  harmless means, pain is relieved; nervousness,  sleeplessness, and various other miseries from which  invalids suffer are controlled without incurring  the risk of unpleasant and often untoward effects  of drug palliatives.  A   CENTER   FOR  HEALTH   TRAINING  The Miami - Battle Creek is  not simply  a haven for the  sick; it is a health center with  a definite program of health instruction and training for health building. Interesting illustrated lectures, classes, and personal instruction make the institution a practical training school in the fine art  of  biologic  living.  We  study  the  biology  of  our  horses, cows, pigs, and chickens, and feed them and  care for them scientifically, that is, biologically. In  consequence, we have the most wonderful horses,  cows, pigs, and chickens the world ever saw. But  we forget we have a biology of our own, a way of  life peculiar to our species, a diet specially suited to  the genus (homo sapiens), a regimen and environment to which we are by nature adapted, which  belongs to us. Below you may see a large group of  guests enjoying a health lecture by the late Dr. John  Harvey Kellogg in the garden patio on a sunny  February afternoon. Lectures are given each week  by various members of the staff.  The new way to health puts major emphasis on  diet. When one learns and applies all the newer  knowledge of nutrition which modern scientific research has given us, he soon finds that he has discovered a new way of living. This does not mean that  he has become an ascetic; but, instead, he is a true  epicure, one who dines daintily and eats with discriminating taste. The new way of living, which, in  fact, is a return to the old and natural way, often  results in quick relief from headache, indigestion, constipation, and hosts of other ills, and a definite slowing up of old age encroachments.  The soundness of this philosophy of physiologic  rectitude has been proved in the experience of tens  of thousands of intelligent men and women who  have found health and happiness through a change  of dietary and other living habits, to conform to  modern scientific requirements.  One is puzzled by the fact that so few Americans  take cognizance of the great truths discovered in our  nutrition laboratories of recent years. The last decade  has added tremendously to our knowledge of foods  and the science of eating, yet how few persons or  families select their daily foods with any recognition of the knowledge science has made available to  us. Habit and taste still rule supreme, while science  is shrugged off nonchalantly, and even flippantly, by  the great majority of our people.  SUPERHEALTH     ^.ess^nce of the "Battle Creek  IS THE GOAL ot "S^t living is not new or  original, but simply the close alignment of all the habits of the individual with recognized biologic and physiologic facts.  The goal is, of course, superhealth. It is not enough  not to be sick. It is every person's right to have  abounding vitality and an ample margin of reserve,  that he may be strong of limb, keen of mind, aspiring of spirit, and courageous of heart. Never in the  world's long history have vitality and virility been  of greater importance or at such a peranum as  today.  It takes strong men and women to measure up to  the tumultous times in which we live.

This is particularly  true of business and professional people and all those of  sedentary occupations, from the clerk in the shoestore  to the president in the bank. Man alone of all animals  sits down in a cushioned chair and allows himself to  decay through lack of exercise.  The sedentary man loses the desire as well as the  capacity for exercise. Long hours of mental work in a  poorly ventilated, smoke-filled office conduce to nerve tire  and create a craving for rest; while, as a matter of fact,  exercise is more needed than repose, and a brisk walk  in fresh air is far more invigorating than rest or sleep.  WHAT   EXERCISE  WILL   DO   FOR  YOU  Systematic exercise benefits the  lungs by keeping in active use  each one of the millions of air  cells which together present an absorbing surface of more  than one thousand square feet. Exercise enlarges the  chest. Exercise aids digestion through its stimulating  effect upon vital combustion. Exercise does for the vital  fires of the body what a pair of bellows does for the  fire in the grate.

Exercise aids the liver by its remarkable influence upon the  movement of blood in the liver vessels. Neglect of exercise weakens the heart, and the tone of many of the  muscles of the body deteriorates.  The Miami-Battle Creek has worked out exercises  suited to all types of patients, even those with weak  hearts and other crippled organs where exercise must  be carefully supervised and controlled.

That was the perspicacious observation of Dietl, the brilliant student of the great pathologist,  Rokitanski. The Miami-Battle Creek employs, of course,  all rational accredited curative agencies as palliative and  accessory measures, but for real curative effects reliance  is placed upon those great natural forces which energize  the body and sustain its vital functions.  Physiotherapy, upon which the Miami-Battle Creek  puts so great dependence, comprises the whole range of  rational curative agents of a physical or non-medicinal  character.  Modern physiologic therapeutics includes not merely  the physical agencies, represented by light, heat and diet,  exercise and other biologic agencies, but the more recently discovered physiologic measures such as serum  therapy, vitamins, endocrines or hormones, and the rapidly growing curative agents developed by nutrition and  physiologic laboratories.  Among the special forms of physiotherapy used most  efficaciously at the Miami-Battle Creek are the following:  HYDROTHERAPY      ^ *?  ^ °£ ^ T ^T f  all curative measures and certainly by  far the most versatile, being more adaptable to a greater  number of diseased conditions than any other. Although  at times almost monopolized by empirics and charlatans,  today there is no therapeutic agent whose use rests upon  a more thoroughly rational and scientific basis than water.  Hippocrates, the "father of modern medicine," had an  excellent understanding of the physiological properties  of water, both hot and cold, which he employed in the  treatment of fevers, ulcers, hemorrhages, and a great  variety of maladies, both medical and surgical.  The elaborately equipped treatment rooms at the Miami-  Battle Creek afford facilities for the  application of water in more than  a hundred different ways, among  which are various kinds of immersion baths, full baths at various temperatures,  rubbing  baths — as  in  under-water  massage for rheumatism; Nauheim baths for heart cases,  neutral baths for insomnia and some  nervous   disorders,   bubble   baths,  foam  baths, sitz baths, leg baths,  whirlpool   baths,   revulsive   baths,  douches —]ct,   spray,   rain,   vapor,  air, percussion, alternate or Scotch;  pacf\s, compresses, fomentations, abdominal bandage or umschlag, rubbing, wet sheet, etc.  \ 		image/tiff						91321959 Bytes	4729	6437	3096602469	RGB	8	600	asc99990000090014001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1458	1458	1459.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1459.jp2

The photographs on these pages show a few hydrotherapy procedures: (i) The Foam Bath. (2) The Salt  Glow. (3) Hot Spinal Fomentation. (4) The Bubble  Bath. (5) The Needle Spray. (6) Massage.  THERMOTHERAPY The™°f^Py * the curative appli-  cation ot heat, which is an inseparable adjuvant of hydrotherapy, because the curative  effects produced by the application of water may be  chiefly attributed to its serving as a vehicle for heat.  By the use of varied modes and degrees of temperature  (in common parlance, heat and cold), an almost infinite  number and degrees of effects may be produced. The hot  compress or fomentation, the heating compress, the Neptune girdle and the revulsive compress are powerful means  of relieving pain in internal as well as in external parts.  Hot baths and rubbings are indispensable for the treatment of rheumatism in its varied forms, and in many  chronic diseases are a highly efficient means of increasing or otherwise modifying functional activity.  Electricity is employed in all its useful forms, especially the sinusoidal  current, which was first utilized for medical purposes at  the Battle Creek Sanitarium, and it has been used there  for more than half a century. In high tension form,  this current is now widely used in diathermy, in X-ray,  and in radiotherapy.  Not only the visible or luminous rays,  but also the invisible ultraviolet rays  and the infrared, or invisible heat rays, are employed  with striking effects for relief of pain, increase of vital  resistance, and normal functioning.  ELECTROTHERAPY  LIGHT  THERAPY  AREOTHERAPY  Air-bathing is gymnastics for the skin.  It hardens and toughens it by filling it with blood and raising resistance against colds and other  germ diseases. As the skin circulation improves, internal congestions  of viscera and nerve centers, often  the cause of headaches, backaches,  sleeplessness, nervousness and many  other ills, disappear.  Exercise in the open air with a  minimum of clothing, and under  careful supervision, is afforded in  the spacious out-door gymnasiums  of the Miami-Battle Creek. 		image/tiff						91321959 Bytes	4729	6437	4265569268	RGB	8	600	asc99990000090015001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1459	1459	1460.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1460.jp2

Its architecture, furnishings and appointments, are all planned as one would a lovely home.  The photograph above shows a typical guest room, with  a glimpse into its individual sun porch beyond. Each  room has a bath and a private telephone. The rooms  are furnished with single, double, or twin beds, as may  be desired.  'J1 he main lobby of the Miami-  Battle Creek is to be seen below.  The decoration of ceiling, walls  and floor, as well as of the pillows  for chairs and davenports, is all  in harmony with the motif of the  Mayan-Aztec architecture of the  building as a whole.  The Miami-Battle Creek is never  excessively hot, thanks to the constant trade winds, and therefore  makes an ideal spot to spend weeks  or months during the temperate  South Forida summers. The building is provided with heating facilities, so that if the weather becomes  uncomfortably cool in winter, the  Miami-Battle Creek guests can  always be warm. The great majority of the time, however, both summer and winter, the guests spend  most of their daylight hours in the  garden patio, or in the solaria enjoying the fresh air and sunshine.  The Battle Creek Idea holds that  Nature is a healer and restorer,  and that if we give her opportunity, she will do much for us. 		image/tiff						93348339 Bytes	4849	6417	4118850620	RGB	8	600	asc99990000090016001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1460	1460	1461.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1461.jp2

In these fevered, critical stressful  times, the guests at the Miami-  Battle Creek find welcome surcease from the cares of life amidst  such peaceful and beautiful surroundings. And this is as it should  be, for the human mechanism cannot long endure continued strain  without irreparable damage to  nerves, heart, arteries, etc. However, if one has a careful physical  checkup at least once yearly, and  has learned how to relax and  throw off care and responsibility  betimes, he can carry surprisingly  heavy loads and burdens. The regimen at the Miami-Battle Creek  is particularly helpful for business and professional people, who,  when at work, are always under  pressure and nerve strain.

The Miami-Battle Creek regi-  men postpones old age. It  teaches one how to grow old,  not only gracefully, but also  healthfully. In the restoration  of health by natural means, rejuvenation occurs. As digestion  and elimination improve, old  age seems to retreat. Elasticity  of skin and muscles returns,  wrinkles smooth out, the face  lifts appreciably, and new spring  appears in the step. The rejuvenescence thus promoted by  regimen therapy means an extension of the span of life—not  into doddering old age and increasing senility—but  in added years wherein the zest for living is not lost,  wherein the mental faculties are alert far beyond  the proverbial "three score and ten."  The "tired business man" or  woman who comes to Miami-  Battle Creek, not only rests but  learns that there are, besides work, other causes of  fatigue, the removal of which results in a great  increase of energy and endurance. He learns, for  example, that the average American adult has a slow  and sluggish colon, that his bowels should move  oftener than once a day, that myriads of unfriendly  and dangerous germs find habitat in his colon because  of putrefaction there, that an unbiologic diet promotes and produces this putrefaction, and that his  eating habits, and his colon habits, all need drastic  change. He also learns that his laggard colon action  and the unfriendly flora therein are not to be cured  by cathartics and purgatives, but by biologic diet in  particular, and by following the biologic regimen  as a whole.  When he has learned these truths, and put them  into practice, he soon finds himself on the road to  superhealth and abounding energy.  Among other gratifying results which may reasonably be expected by the patient at the Miami-  ■  Bell Boy delivering a telegram to guests at Miami-  Battle  Creek.    The service  is  equal to  that  of a  first-class  hotel.  THE   "TIRED  BUSINESS   MAN"  Battle Creek are more refreshing sleep and the disappearance  of any tendency to insoninia.  This is accomplished without  recourse to drugs of any kind,  thanks to methods which often  cure by removing the cause, not  merely by treating the symptom.  The Miami-Battle Creek program of living is also markedly  beneficial in many cases of  High Blood Pressure, Heart and  Kidney Diseases, Obesity, Arthritis and Rheumatism, Emaciation and certain types of  Anemia, Nervous Exhaustion,  Hyperacidity, Hypoacidity, Peptic Ulcers, Gall Bladder Troubles (not due to calculi),  and other Gastro-Intestinal Disorders.  Thus hope for a new lease  of life is offered to thousands  of sufferers who need the help of a thoroughgoing  examination, followed by institutional care under  meticulous superintendence and guidance in a complete health-building program.  Scores of patients return each year for a few weeks  in order to have a physical check-up, and to renew  their resources of energy and vitality. There is no substitute for a thorough, scientific physical examination  at least once a year, particularly for those over forty.  Furthermore, the instruction in right living given  at the Miami-Battle Creek is so practical that you  can take it home with you, and put it into daily  use long after you have left the institution. Literature in book, periodical, and leaflet form, is always  procurable by ertswhile guests for continued instruction in biologic living.  At the Miami-Battle Creek you  find the road to superhealth,  and the blue-ceilinged skies of  Florida, too. Amid ideal surroundings and in the  environment of the American Tropics, you discover  "The New Way to Health."

Ma^ 604,.  -  I   LAYGROUND of the world and one of the most delightful cities in the  world in which to live permanently.  That's Miami, incorporated in 1896 and today has over 300,000 permanent  residents with more than 46 square miles of area. Warm in winter and cool  in summer with average temperatures rarely dropping below 68 or exceeding  81 degrees, the city has justly earned its title of City of Eternal Youth bestowed  by its first developer, the late Henry M. Flagler.  A matter of 75,000 charming homes, real estate assessed at more than  $242,000,000 and more than   101  flourishing industries testifv  to  the  wpIL  balanced economy of the city.   A couple of millioJ  fair proof of its entertainment qualities.  The Gulf Stream, whose gentle breezes temper  some of the best fishing in the world - there are mor  to be caught off Miami, it is the golfer's, tennis plcj  paradise.  In fact, Miami has everything.  If you want to go boating, Miami can provide 1  sailing, speed-boating and sight-seeing on the wateJ  races, there are three horse tracks, and four dog tr  only fronton in the United States where lai Alai (Hi-Li) is played; parks for riding, driving and picnics. There are schools for the young, two colleges for  higher education, and more than 250 churches for worshippers to choose from.  Add to this, first class movies, smart night clubs and at least two beautiful  beaches for swimming and sun-bathing, and the reason for living in Miami  is plain. Added to its other charms, the city is only a few hours by air from  wherever you are or want to be. It sounds too good, but it's perfectly true.

(Mi  JAMI BEACH, America's greatest year-'round resort city, is alsp one of  the fastest growing cities in the United States.  Miami Beach, in 1915, was a mangrove swamp, with no buildings no  streets and with very little signs of life. Today it is a thriving city with 331  hotels, 1,000 apartment buildings and thousands of fine homes and many  blocks of high class business establishments, with accommodations and facilities for housing and entertaining about 90,000 visitors.  Visitors to Miami Beach marvel at the well-kept public beaches, the beautiful landscaped parks and at the cleanliness of the city. There are 22 islands  within the city limits of Miami Beach and numerous waterways where sightseeing boats carry hundreds of visitors daily.  Miami Beach, with a normal population of 32,000, is one of the outstanding  cities of the world. Its gorgeous shopping centers, its glamorous night spots,  cabana clubs, fine hotels cater to celebrities and important people of the world  - yet people from every walk of life are frequent visitors in both winter and  summer months.  Climate, of course, is a leading attraction of Miami Beach. Summer temperature averages 81 and winters average 69 degrees.  GENUINE CURTEICH-CHICAGO  "c.  T. ART-COLORTONE"  CREATION   (REG.  U. S.

It applies to the lower East Coast of Florida from Palm  Beach southward. Our book deals with the Sun-Sea-Ara of Greater Miami, the  picturesque shores of Miami Beach and Miami.  FOREWORD  The Shores of Greater Miami are magnetic. So much so, in fact, that they attract  successful men and women from many far  places. Some of the inducements that bring  these fine, friendly folks are the many opportunities afforded for play, relaxation and  health. Numerous allurements combine to  create an irresistible pull that increasingly  continues to bring more and more leaders  of business and society. A great many of  these persons have traveled the world over  and find here most of the things that contribute so much to the real enjoyment of  living.  Once having come for the benefits, many  become so attached that they are continuously establishing their homes in this area.  It is an interesting revelation to find that  of the five hundred and thirty-two improved  waterfront properties described herein, forty-  eight of the buildings have been or are being  erected and thirty-two already improved  properties have been acquired, all of these  during the years of 1930 and 1931. The  owners of these properties become a part of  the growing community and are contributing  much to the culture, beauty and well being  of Greater Miami.  It is impossible to narrate about all of  the notables who reside in this charming  area. In this book I have attempted to deal  primarily with those persons, who through  good fortune of successful endeavor and by-  preference have located up to this time,  along the beautiful Shores of Miami Beach  and of Miami. Their delightful and picturesque homes form an array that is truly  remarkable.  Yes, and what a wonderful variety of  waterfront locations: Along the restless and  colorful Atlantic with its mysterious blue  river,   the   mighty   Gulf   Stream;   Miami  Beach Bay fronts with ever-changing sunset  views across Biscayne Bay and with downtown Miami's inspiring skyline in the  background; pretty lakes, lagoons, canals,  Venetian waterways; mid-bay islands with  wonderful panoramic outlooks; mainland bay  fronts in delightful home neighborhoods;  Miami's famous Tropic Bay-Front Park; natural hammock growth and little cliffs; the  rocky elevation of Silver Bluff and picturesque shoreline of Coconut Grove. Indeed,  in the area of Greater Miami every whim  and taste is gratified through a wide choice  of desirable home environments.  In the following portrayal of fine homes  and waterfront scenes, the matter for convenience has been classified under district  headings. You will note that the fore part  of the book contains directory lists of persons  having their homes along the waterfronts  in particular districts. Also photographs of  typical beautiful views. The after part of  the book is devoted to persons and fine properties in localities and with district maps.  To readily locate districts, please refer to  key map in back of book.  The publication of this book has been  possible through the wholehearted co-operation of individuals to whom I am deeply  grateful. I sincerely hope that it comes up  to expectations. I trust the matter has been  treated in such a way that the book will  prove interesting and valuable; a book worth  retaining and a real missionary for the enjoyment of living in this delightful area.  We of Greater Miami are agreed that there  is a hearty welcome and a place for every  worthwhile person along these shores. These  are friendly, enjoyable shores. Here are  magnetic shores.  Frank F. Stearns, Publisher.  February, 1932.

When completed with buildings, it is estimated the total cost will  run over a million and a half dollars.  (C)    Next on the south is the delightful development of:  Harvey B. Graves  Rochester, New York  (For map of Sunny Isles please turn to Page 47)  SUNNY ISLES, a truly Venetian environment with a water frontage for every lot.  Picturesque winding waterways, dotted with scores of islands, connect the Intercoastal Canal  with a Venetian waterway parallel with and about three hundred feet back from the ocean  surf. These waterways are spanned at intervals by artistic coral rock bridges. More than  one hundred of the tea-garden or outlook Islands have been created. Every homesite is  truly "A Port of Call." The deep fertile soil produces luxuriant growth of tropical foliage,  including Cocoanut and Royal palms.  Following are some of the homes:  Edith M. West  Dayton, Ohio  Ocean Boulevard  Boyd H.

Indian Creek Drive, bordering as it does,  the beautiful and placid stretch of water  known as Indian Creek, is decidedly in a  class by itself.  Along the east of this drive fronting on  Indian Creek are many charming homes and  some of the more pretentious apartment  buildings. The artistic concrete bridge spanning the creek at 41st Street adds interest  and accessibility. Lake Pancoast at the south,  causes the drive to swing over and rejoin  Collins avenue. This interesting body of  water is especially picturesque with its black  swans and other water fowl.  During the winter season Lake Pancoast  and Indian Creek are alive with gondolas  and small water craft.  «^^  0  V  ilflll  mSSgmm '?miSi.  1^  !  l|  1!  PHOTO COURTESY GERTRUDE R.

Quoting from Mr. LaGorce's article in  a recent issue of the National Geographic  Magazine, entitled "Florida—The Fountain  of Youth:"  "Sun makes climate and climate with the  aid of Trade Winds makes Florida. She  tilts her sunburned nose so far down into  the tropics that only here, in all the United  States, can you pick cocoanuts from their  lofty habitat—that is if you can climb well.  Life here has a different tempo, a sort of  tropic rhythm. Sun, sand, the blue sparkling  waters of the Gulf Stream, blossoms of every  hue and waving palms bring a sense of  luxury even to the masses."  LA DONA TELLO OF THE PALMS  The waters mirror molten gold  When sunset glows on Biscayne Bay,  The clouds are crags from which emerge  The fanfare of decamping day,  In mauve and crimson garments veiled,  The heralds of the Southern moon  Sound loud their trumpets of farewell  To twilight hour, that passed too soon-  In starry gauze fair Luna comes  To Doha Tello of the Palms.  marie tello phillips  WINTER   HOME   OF    MR.

Mr. Brickell had led  an adventurous life, having been over most  of the world. Mrs. Brickell was a native of  Australia. They came here from Stueben-  ville, Ohio. After being here a short while  they began to realize the possibilities of the  place and purchased Spanish Grants, totaling  2,560 acres of land south of the Miami  River.

Pepper, former president of the Miami Realty  Board,  gives one a good word, picture of the "Cliff Hammock' district:  The luxuriance of the primeval jungle, with all manner of rare and beautiful ferns,  vines and trees struggling for supremacy or places in the sun, and with the consequent  enrichment   of  the  soil   for  more   formal   or   colorful   tropic   landsdaping;   the  elevation   and  then the picturesqueness of the naturally sculptured little cliffs of rock rising above the  water or the shores ; exclusivenesg as a residential section and its close proximity to hotels,  business and theatre district; the historic events that transpired here; legendary stories  that have attached to the Punch Bowl and other places ; all these and more give this district  a peculiarly strong appeal.

BECAUSE of the cultured persons living here—  BECAUSE of the large percentage of the residents owning their homes—  BECAUSE its municipally owned water plant furnishes the pure, soft drinking water,  BECAUSE Coconut Grove (with the Beautiful Silver Bluff Section) is largely  built on a high, rocky ridge, high enough so no matter how severe the storm or rain  there is never danger of standing water.

This title applies for  every month of the year, for in Miami "the month of June seems never gone."  Nature has richly endowed the Miami area with a surpassing climate, the bathing beaches  of the Atlantic Ocean and beautiful Bay Biscayne, all of which combined with the luxuriant  foliage of the semi-tropics makes life in the great out-of-doors of South Florida one of unusual charm and delight.  There is scarcely a sport in the long list of open air recreation that is not to be found in  or around Miami, excepting those needing snow or ice.  Check any one of the following list and the sportsman can come to Miami and enjoy life  to his heart's content:  Ocean bathing, yachting, boating, fishing, golfing, tennis, bowling on the green, shuffie  board, horse shoe pitching, motoring, aviation, night clubs, dancing, dining, horse races, dog  races and Jai Alai.  A good sized book could be written in describing the various interesting and important  features in connection with each sport on the above list. Millions of dollars have been spent  on club houses, grounds and equipment which rival or surpass anything to be found throughout the entire United States. These include yacht clubs, golf clubs, surf clubs, cabana colonies,  angler's clubs, playing fields for night playing of tennis, diamond ball, football under electric  flood lights and magnificent open air Spanish dancing casinos with famous broadcasting orchestras which in themselves have become Miami institutions of far flung fame.  Summed up, those who guide and direct the public affairs in Greater Miami look forward  with confidence to the time when the Miami area will be recognized as the outstanding recreation center of the entire world.

Jesse, Vice-President of the Miami Realty Board,  describes the Buena Vista-Miramar district:  "This convenient Northeast District offers many advantages to home owners.  Famed Biscayne Boulevard paralleling the Bay at an average distance of four blocks,  provides handy shopping centers, or brings downtown Miami and the Beach within  easy access. Practically all streets extend to the water's edge. Homes along the shore  have unobstructed views across Biscayne Bay to the districts of Beach Bay shores lined  with splendid homes.

Ellis  Founder of The Miami Solarium  umanity}s first medicine was sunshine. When  primitive Man began to ail, he instinctively  turned to the sun for remedial aid—impelled  by the same inherent law of nature that makes plants  turn their leaves and flowers to follow the sun's daylight orbit across the skies.  The health-giving qualities of sunlight have been  recognized since the very dawn of history. The  medical lore of all ancient civilizations attests its  value. The early tribes of Mexico, Peru and India  worshipped the sun as the source of light and health,  and the Greeks and Romans designed and built their  homes with Solaria, or sun porches, where sun baths  were taken regularly.  While these ancient races realized the curative  value of the sun's rays, they attributed its health-  giving properties to the omnipotent power of the sun  as a deity, and it was only in comparatively recent  years that Heliotherapy was put on a scientific basis.  The modern era began with Finsen of Copenhagen, who, in  1893, found that the invisible ultra-violet rays were the active and  curative components in sunlight, and he was followed by Rollier  and others, who amazed the world with their discoveries.  Careful study revealed many of the mysteries of the healing  miracle of sunshine. It was discovered that ultra-violet ray exposure would increase the number of red blood cells, increase the  bactericidal power of the blood, normalize the mineral content of  the body, improve the eliminative powers of the skin and raise the  general resistance of the organism body against disease.  To the modern worshippers of the Sun, Miami sunshine offers  ultra-violet rays in quantity and intensity not equalled elsewhere and  this city is fast becoming a mecca for visitors from all parts of the  world  who  desire to avail  themselves of its health-building rays.  Modern   Lami's   vviih   .ukkcikv.Quabtz   Bueneks   at   Miami  Solarium   Manufactures   Artificial   Sunlight.

Spurred by mere  rumors and hearsay evidence of a land that was warm all  winter—where the sun shone almost continuously—they  gladly endured discomfort and privation to reach Miami.  Weather Bureau statistics and years of world-wide fame  have confirmed triumphantly those first rumors about  South Florida's matchless climate. Today rail, air, water  and highway transportation have reduced the trip to Miami  to a few pleasant hours. And the bountiful facilities of  America's only "Metropolis of the Tropics" have enabled  thousands to play in the sun every winter at no more  expense than they would have incurred at home.  All you need, then, is Time—in order to play, rest or work  where it's summer all winter; where it's cool all summer;  where healthful outdoor sports are available in widest  variety; where cultural advantages match those of your  "home town"; where there's fun to be had, places to go,  things to do every golden day and silvery night; and  where, day after day, all winter, every winter, it's warm.  All you need is time—a week, a year or the rest of your  life! It can be done. To help you plan, this booklet will  try to show you how and why tens of thousands come South  to the sunshine—to the golden sunshine of Miami, on duty  all winter long with its priceless gifts of health and happiness, free to all who will accept them.  Playing in "june"  all winter long  People live out-of-doors here.  It's "June" all winter long. And  the endless variety of ways to  play under the sun keeps you  busy deciding how many kinds  of health-building, life-extending  pleasure you can crowd into  every exciting day. Below is a  brief summary of only a few of  Miami's available midwinter  pastimes for both young and old.  EIGHT beautiful courses in the Miami area provide  ample facilities. Four of them are public; and the  remaining four private courses extend a hospitable  welcome to visitors.  EXTENSIVE courts maintained in six public parks  are augmented by many private courts. There are  lighted courts for night play.  LAYOUTS for horseshoes, shuffle-board, checkers,  chess, roque, bowling-on-the-green and other park  sports are maintained by Miami's efficient recreation  department. They offer mild exercise and friendly  companionship to the thousands of old and young  people who prefer them to more vigorous activities.  bathing EIGHT miles of ocean beach assure a place on the  sand for everyone—and everyone goes! You change  to bathing suits at home, thus dispensing with bath  houses at the beach. Water temperature remain about  70    all year.  RIDING     MANY fine stables, plenty of tropic bridle paths   and that's a combination riding enthusiasts make no  attempt to resist in Miami!  bowling OUTDOORS and in, night and day, bowling is  widely popular in Miami. There are dozens of alleys,  frequented by young and old. "Leagues" are organized to sharpen competition.  boating GREEN and blue waters of the Gulf Stream and  Biscayne Bay are among the finest anywhere for  sailing in winter—which accounts for the world's  greatest concentration of pleasure craft in Miami's  harbor each season. Complete facilities for boats and  boating are available. The inland waterway from  Maine to Miami affords safe passage for yachts.

Her churches, theatres,  concerts, musicales, lectures, clubs and art galleries are  ranked with those of any large city. No person of wide and  varied interests needs suffer a lack of "food for the soul."  Miami's friendly informality often permits closer contact  with visiting world - leaders in arts, sciences and letters  than would be possible in a more formal atmosphere.  These typical evidences of cosmopolitanism are augmented  by many not found elsewhere. Miami's proximity to South  America has fostered the growth of a large Latin American Colony and made her an important center for Pan  American relations. Visitors find social contacts and interchange of ideas with this circle stimulating and enjoyable.  Miami's unique Civic Centre brings together sectional  groups in State Clubs from all parts of the country for  the renewing of "back home" ties.  Among these many friendly, interesting groups the visitor  will find new companions with whom to enjoy the thousand and one diversions of this Metropolis of the Tropics.  cultural and religious life.  CHURCHES 91 CHURCHES, including almost all denominations, welcome visitors to their services, social programs and community activities.  WOMEN'S MIAMI women's clubs are among the most active  clubs and influential groups in the city. Many important  civic improvements originated among these progressive social, civic and professional organizations.  Local charities have benefited tremendously from  their activities. Visitors are made welcome at meetings, programs, and social gatherings.  PUBLIC     MIAMI'S public libraries, staffed by competent spec-  LIBRARIES ialists, offer a complete range of books including all  well-received current novels. More than 32,000 volumes are listed.

That is Big Business! And it explains why  living costs, which would have to be exceptionally high in  a small resort, are about the same in Miami as those prevailing in a comparable non-resort city. "Mass-production"  does it—quantity buying, assurance of a large "market,"  all the factors that permit progressive lowering of prices  as the "volume of sales" increases.  Facilities for approximately 150,000 visitors at a time are available in the Miami area, assuring a wide choice. Rates naturally  favor those who plan a longer stay on the same principles that  allow "wholesale" rates in merchandise. Rates and prices quoted  here are, of necessity, very general. "Minimum" accommodations  usually fill first, and in the peak season, visitors sometimes find  prices slightly higher, not because they are raised but because only  premium accommodations remain. Visitors in November, December, April and May will find plenty of fine accommodations at  minimum  rates,   while  special   "summer  rates"   are  even  lower.

Coconut palms  are as native here as elms or oaks "up north." Substitute  pelicans and flamingoes for sparrows and pigeons—fiery  blaze of Royal Poinciana for the lavender of violets—the  lush profusion of Everglades jungles for a persimmon  grove. And permeating the city is the enchanting mystery  of America's only tropics. Magic, indescribable, it "gets"  you as soon as you pass the imaginary line that sets the  tip of Florida apart from every other section of the U. S.  And it's the kind of tropics you can live in.

Almost constant  ocean breezes, free from the smoke, dust and pollen so  troublesome to hay-fever sufferers. Miami thus presents  the amazing paradox of a great, metropolitan city, providing every modern service, yet filled to its borders with  hibiscus, poinsettia, boungainvillea, a dozen kinds of  palm—thousands of strangely fascinating reminders that  this is something worth coming all the way south to find!

Page 4																																	asc9999000036	asc99990000360004001		JAMES DEERING  Manufacturer and Philanthropist  1859-1925  James Deering was born in South Paris, Maine, on November 12,  1859, the seventh in descent from Roger Deering (also spelled Dering)  of Dartmouth, Devonshire, England, who came to New England about  1663 and settled at Kittery, Maine, where he was a shipwright.  While James Deering was still a small boy, his father moved from  the family home in South Paris to Portland, Maine. More than ten years  later (1873), William Deering sold his business interests there and  brought his family to live in Evanston, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago  where he built his factory for the newly established Deering Harvester  Company.  James Deering, besides his schooling as a youth iri Portland, Maine  and in Evanston, Illinois, was educated at Northwestern University (of  which his father was an outstanding benefactor and chairman of the  Board of Trustees) and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  At the age of twenty-one he entered the works of the Deering Harvester Company, acquiring a thorough knowledge of the manufacturing  side of the business, as well as familiarizing himself with the sales department and its methods. He traveled throughout the west, demonstrating the actual operation of the Deering machines in the harvest field.  After the withdrawal of his father from the company in 1901, Mr. Deering, his brother, Charles Deering, and his brother-in-law, Richard F.  Howe, conducted the business as a copartnership until 1902, when it  merged with the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company and other farm  machinery manufacturing companies to form the International Harvester  Company. From that time until 1919, when he resigned, Mr. Deering  was vice-president of the International Harvester Company, but continued to serve as a director until his death.  Following his retirement from active business, he devoted himself  to his artistic and philanthropic interests and to travel. He was fond of  the French people and French civilization. He was an annual visitor in  Paris and for many years maintained a residence there.

He made large donations to charity and a variety of benevolent  enterprises in Chicago and elsewhere in the United States. Most of his  gifts were made anonymously. But in addition to a known endowment  of $1,000,000, established in 1914 to assist charity patients at the Wesley  Memorial Hospital, Chicago, of which his father was the founder, his  will records bequests of $500,000 to the Visiting Nurse Association of  Chicago, $500,000 to the Children's Memorial Hospital in that city and  $500,000 for a free ward in the Jackson Memorial Hospital of Miami—  the first free ward made available to the people of Dade County, Florida.  His brother, Charles Deering, made an additional gift for the endowment  of this ward.  Although he continued to maintain his Chicago home until his  death, he opened Vizcaya as his Florida home on Christmas Day, 1916.  The following year he transferred his legal residence to Miami.  James Deering was a widely traveled man, not only throughout the  Orient but in all the countries of Europe. He read French, Italian and  German with ease. For some twenty years before construction on Vizcaya  was begun, he started to collect many of the art treasures which went into  its building and furnishing. He visited many parts of the world seeking  the finest winter climate. He tried Egypt, the Riviera, North Africa,  Southern Italy and various American winter resorts before he made his  decision to build in Dade County.  His architects have testified to the fact that much of the beauty of  Vizcaya and the perfection of its detail were due to Mr. Deering's knowledge and taste. He participated actively in designing the buildings and  the gardens and did not hesitate to tear down and rebuild when he was  not satisfied with what had been done. Of all the great houses in America  probably none owes so much to its builder and owner as does Vizcaya.  James Deering died a bachelor, leaving Vizcaya to his nephews and  nieces. Two of these, Marion Deering McCormick and Barbara Deering  Danielson, bought their brother's and their cousin's interests in this  property from their respective estates, and it is they who have made  Vizcaya available to the public. 		image/tiff						53096685 Bytes	3635	4869	1669681682	RGB	8	600	asc99990000360005001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1604	1604	1605.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1605.jp2

They were often men  from Spain's Province of Biscay, or Viz-  cay, and sometimes named their ships  from their homeland — Vizcaya. The  rough Bay of Biscay launched their  ships; the waters of Miami sometimes  harbored them.  Spaniards used this name "Miami" before 1600. A chart of that date, the  Seville Map, locates the very shores on  which you stand as surrounding the "La-  guna di Miami." The last of many successive Royal Spanish vessels named Viz-  caya was sunk in battle in the Spanish-  American War in near by Cuban waters.  Possibly some of the live oaks overhead  echoed, as young trees, to the Vizcayan  dialect, as the earliest adventurers landed  here.  The Main Gate  A MODEL of one of the early Spanish ships—the Caravel Vizcaya—  serves as crest above the gates you  enter, and this ship became Mr. Deering's  yacht emblem and his private flag.  But the gates themselves are of Italian  form. Their patterns were taken from  a palace built for those great Venetian Admirals, the Pisani. You will find  throughout the house and gardens that  Vizcaya looks to Italy for its inspiration  rather than to Spain.  Just within the gates is a 17th century  statue of the "South" (the Noonday—  Mezzogiorno), to show us how Pisani  admirals imagined, no doubt, the Indian  of the "Laguna di Miami"—a youthful  Chief, clad in plumes and crowned with  the sun.  Making your way beneath curious  tropical trees, you encounter an old Italian   statue   of   Mercury — the   god   of 		image/tiff						53096685 Bytes	3635	4869	2706883580	RGB	8	600	asc99990000360006001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1605	1605	1606.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1606.jp2

In a  glade beyond at your right, an antique  statue of Neptune is set, because this is a  forest by the sea; its strange trees stretch  out even into the salt waters. Farther to  the right is Nereus, partner of Neptune,  protector of sea creatures, whose coral  rock is the work of his reef builders.  Shortly beyond, you reach the circular  Plaza, the first formal space within the  forest or "hammock." At your right  hand rises a fountain niche. Its architecture is that of Longhena, designer of the  dome of Santa Maria della Salute on the  Grand Canal of Venice. The figures of  two Venetian mariners fill opposite angles of the Plaza. To these unknown  portraits of the 17th century have been  given the names of Ponce de Leon and  Baldassare Vizcaino, his half-mythical  sailing master. The Plaza, gorgeous with  bougainvillea, is decorated by great tall  busts of fauns and nymphs.  At this point you will hear the sounds  of small cascades and jets of water, and  straight ahead you will catch your first  glimpse of the House. Among the trees  that frame this picture are sacred bo-trees  of India, under which the Buddha delighted to rest and meditate. Observe, a  moment, the water courses. They derive  from the Villa Lante, near Rome, and  are all shell-like in their forms. Take  special note of these shells, for you will  encounter the same form at many different places farther on in Vizcaya. You  will discover the Shell, the Spanish Caravel, and the Sea Horse used over and  over as appropriate to a house and to a  garden on the sea.  Descend now into the forecourt, a  stately enclosure of oval shape. At either  side, as you enter, are great Venetian  vase-forms above fountain heads. Passing right, you encounter a superb 17th  century gateway of pink marble and Is-  trian stone, brought from the Palazzo  Bevilacqua Lamassa at Verona. This  gateway and its companion across the  court were installed here in a suitable  framework of coralline rock surmounted  by the Sea Horse, which Mr. Deering  appropriately used for the house emblem  of Vizcaya.  What now lies before you is a great  Baroque Palazzo planned somewhat in  the manner of a fortress and derived, not  copied, from Italian sources. Its design  is the work of F. Burrall Hoffman, Jr.  and Paul Chalf in, associate architects, and  developed in final detail by Mr. Chalfin.  Actual construction on the buildings was  begun in May, 1914 and completed just  before America entered World War I.  After the war the extensive formal gardens were designed and executed by  Mr. Chalfin.  The House is built of coralline limestone, excavated largely from quarries  owned by Mr. Deering. Rare marbles  are found in the House, but all structure  and much of the outdoor sculpture is of  this native rock; even the stucco on the  wall spaces is made from limestone quarried on the grounds. From Hafeina were  brought the beautiful old tiles of the  roofs, discarded from ancient houses in  exchange for new. The long, low steps  were cut from local rock and sawed  to show the curious marine designs of  brain coral and fan coral, easily recognized.

You face a fountain  group composed of a late Roman bath in  yellow marble surmounted by an Italian  statue of Bacchus from the 17th century,  at either side of which are genii astride  sea monsters. The arrangement of such  compositions was a favorite pastime for  cardinals and noble collectors of Rome.  The tall entrance doors to right and  left are said to have come from the vestibule of the Hotel Beauharnais, the palace  occupied by Napoleon's stepson in Paris.  Two vases of Egyptian granite, sculptured during the craze for Egypt that  followed Napoleon's African campaign,  stand on either hand; and wall brackets,  in an English version of the classic, flank  the doors.  This Loggia, then, is a composite—  France, England and Italy endow it, each  designing in the style of Rome and  Athens.  It may be helpful to the visitor to  point out that, as in most great European houses, the rooms on the main floor  of the House are formal in character and  are intended to be the background for  formal entertainment. They are what  would be called the "state apartments"  in a European palace, or even in the  White House in Washington. Most of  the daily life at Vizcaya was carried on  in the second floor rooms and galleries,  as well as in the Patio below.  The Directoire Entrance Hall  HERE the spirit of the ancient world  is further emphasized. The furniture and decoration are based on  classic   models,  in  a   freer   and   lighter  style than that afterwards crystallized by  Napoleon and called Empire.  The walls show a set of the famous  hand-printed woodblock papers of Joseph  Dufour of Paris, simulating sculptured  reliefs and dating from 1814. The first  panel to the left shows a palm tree, particularly appropriate in Florida.  To the left of the alcove is the ladies'  powder room. To the right is the gentlemen's cloak room, executed in the lively  Rococo manner of Italy.  The Hall opens at its north end into  The Adam Library  EVEN before the French Directoire,  the Adam brothers developed in  England the type of classic design  harmoniously shown in this room. Their  decorative forms occur in the reliefs on  the walls. The fine Corinthian mantel  designed by them has above it a classic  mosaic. In addition, the brothers Adam  inspired Italian artists in London, Naples  and Rome so that, while the furnishings  here are both English and Italian, the  differences in spirit and detail are not  great.  The chairs, so like those of Hepple-  white design, are believed on the authority of Bardini to have belonged to Pauline, sister of Napoleon, who, married  to the Roman Prince Borghese, refurnished his magnificent old palace in the  fashionable classic style. The seats of the  chairs are of French tapestry from the  Beauvais looms.  The remarkable 18 th century rug is  from a Spanish loom set up in Madrid  by Bourbon kings to emulate those of La  Savonnerie  at  Paris.

To these two rooms, France, England,  Rome and Spain have all lent their versions of classic feeling.  Turning back into the Hall on your  left you enter-the  &lt;iMarie Antoinette Salon  THE name of this room is derived  from the silk panels on the walls,  woven by Philippe de Lassalle  (1723-1805), the favorite designer and  weaver of Marie Antoinette, who was  the Queen of Louis XVI. The silk panels  show this French artist's (and no doubt  the Queen's) conception of tropical palm  trees, somewhat inaccurate, and flowering  with delightfully improbable blossoms.  However, the whole style of this room  is Louis XV, particularly as it was developed in Italy. The gilt and lacquered  paneling of the room once adorned a  palace in Palermo and is done in the  Venetian manner.  The plaster ceiling, dating from about  1750, is from the Palazzo Rossi in Venice. The limestone mantel is pure French  Louis XV, and the white marble bust on  its shelf is a portrait of La Comtesse de  Montbrian by Louis Simon Boizot (1743-  1809),   acquired   from   her  family   at  Chatel, France. The furniture is French  and Italian of the 18 th century, most of  it from the epoch of Louis XV.  You will note particularly the magnificent chandelier, as well as the superb  embroidered wool carpet of a most unfamiliar type, perhaps French, perhaps  Spanish. The variegated cream ground is  needlework, and the polychrome birds,  obelisks and floral motifs are added with  a darning stitch (filet guipure). The design is mid-18th century. It is worth  noting here that the collection of European carpets at Vizcaya is not equalled  by any other museum in America.  You next pass into the  TSlorth Hall  IMMEDIATELY at your right you will  see a tiny telephone room, charmingly  decorated in the 18th century manner,  with a fine Venetian chair of the same  period. Farther along to your right are  some Spanish chests covered with worn  old velvet and studded with nails in a  characteristic manner. The two columns  of carved walnut are Umbrian of the  16th century.  The doors and door frames behind and  before you are massively carved in a pure  Italian Baroque style of the early 17th  century. The doorways are relatively  small, as houses of that period were still  conceived of partly as fortresses and designed for defense.  The Great Renaissance Hall  THE general character of this room  recalls the  16 th century in Italy,  the period of the High Renaissance.

The chandeliers were acquired  from a Spanish cathedral by Mr. Charles  Deering.  At your right you will observe the  huge French chimney piece, never quite  finished and said to have been removed  from a wing of the Chateau de Chenon-  ceaux, associated with Queen Catherine  de Medicis. This chimney piece is a noteworthy example of French Renaissance  sculpture of the mid-16th century. Some  of the armorial bearings have been cut  away but you may still make out the  central arms supported by lions. On a  table other ancient lions appear, and in  the great rug and in the tapestry you  will also discover them. Over the main  doorway is still another lion on a gilded  escutcheon.  The notable Italian tapestry on the  right wall, woven about 15 50 for Duke  Ercole II of Ferrara, depicts (H)ercules  killing the Nemean Lion.  The long carpet in the center of the  room is one of the greatest existing  Spanish rugs. The armorial bearings show  it was made for the Admiral of Castile,  Fadriquez Enriquez (d. 1473) and, his  wife, Marina de Ayala. This nobleman  was the grandfather of Ferdinand the  Catholic, the patron of Columbus.  The rug in front of the hearth is an  extremely rare example. Few rugs of its  period—the early 15 th century—survive  today, but it is still strong and clear  in color. Knitting and embroidery are  used to produce its Saracenic pattern representing many animals.  The remarkable tables in this great  hall show some of the earliest types that  precede our modern table, and show  them in most important examples. The  rich, square table on your right shows  the early four-legged type, sturdy and  heavy in feeling. The frame of the table  is figured with small golden arabesques,  and bears a slab of rich semiprecious  stones and fine rare marbles inlaid elaborately in the Tuscan Granducal workshop  of the Medici. Such table tops were in  the giving only of the Crown, and this  example was presented to the Strozzi  Family, nobler but less exalted than the  Grand Duke's own. On the long center  table of unusual size and dignity may be  found winged unicorns, symbols of the  Farnese Family, still bearing traces of  original guilding.  On the south wall is a 17th century  Neapolitan painting of the Madonna,  enshrined in an imposing high altar  which has been cleverly converted into  the organ front. At the top is the inscription in Greek, "A Conqueror I Lie  Conquered."  Little in this room originated later  than the 16th century, but numerous objects antedate that great period, some of  them made as early as 1400. Among the  velvets in this room are the rarest colors  that survive in velvet from the 16th century—violet and blue. The marble ornaments are either late Roman or else Renaissance imitations of them. Notice also a  number of fine bronze mortars, of which  there are many in the House.  As you leave this room, you pass  through the East Hallway, which contains the organ screen, and arrive in the 		image/tiff						50014608 Bytes	3424	4869	3286249384	RGB	8	600	asc99990000360010001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1609	1609	1610.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1610.jp2

It is   treated  in  the  light Roman  manner   of   the   country   villa   of  Cardinal Albani.  The great cedar doors, encrusted with  bronze, as well as the marble door frames,  come from an old palace in Rome later  acquired by that Tor Ionia who was  banker to Napoleon, rival of the Rothschilds and friend of the famous Cardinal,  Alessandro Albani. The Torlonia arms  appear above the doors, under busts in  the antique manner. The table with  dolphins of Cippolino marble is from  the Sciarra Palace, Rome. The marble  floor is in the Venetian style, and the  light standards are Venetian processional  lanterns.  Note particularly two large, cream-  colored Chinese goldfish bowls of the  Sung dynasty (960-1279) and two similar bowls in blue and white of the Ming  dynasty (1368-1644).  Leaving this loggia by the south door  you enter  The Music Room  THIS room is Rococo in spirit, continuing the restlessness of the Baroque style of a century earlier, but  expressing it in lighter and gayer form.  The paneled walls and ceiling, painted  in Milan in the middle of the 18 th century, are decorated with shells, coral and  curious marine forms appropriate to an  Italian palace by the sea. The room is  furnished in that restless and playful  style—the Rococo—in which the people  of the 18th century delighted; gilded  and painted, contorted, gay, but never  pompous. The size of the room is suitable to the intimate music of spinet, harp  and zither. The spinet (formerly exhibited at the Art Institute of Chicago) was  executed in 1645 and is signed by its  maker, Horatius Albano; the zither is a  century later and the painted harp a little  later still. Note the brilliant Aubusson  rug of the early 18th century.  We of today might not care to sit in  such a room, but the music of Mozart  and his colleagues was often heard in  such—music as brilliantly contrived as  the room, listened to by an audience  whose manners, costumes and conversations were equally conventional. The  Italy that produced these rooms was  music mad.  Qreat Banquet Hall  HERE we are back once more in  the dignity and sobriety of the  early 16th century as we saw it a  few moments ago in the Renaissance  Hall. The intricate plaster ceiling is patterned in the form of a labyrinth — a  graceful maze of sharp angles which may  be followed in a puzzling path to the  central enclosure. Below hangs a splendid valance of 17th century brocaded  red velvet. The lights placed high upon  rare matched antique columns take the  form of bouquets in great bronze mortars. The plain walls set off to advantage the severe and handsome furniture  of the room.  First in importance is the massive sideboard to your left. It is Italian, late 15 th  century in period, and still has traces of  Gothic feeling. This piece held the vestments of an important church, as the  religious subjects of its inlay (intarsia)  imply.

The sideboard is conceived in a simple,  impressive architectural style. The chairs  should also be observed; no two identical, but all similarly decorated with  carving and intarsia. The great stretcher  table resembles them in type. On the  table is a 16th century red velvet cover.  Opposite is an important table of  Greek marble with griffin supports in the  Roman style of the first or second century, A. D.  The Italian chimney piece is almost as  handsome in design. Carved in the late  15 th century from the dark sandstone of  the hills near Florence, it represents the  Renaissance revival of the classical style  as conceived by the group of sculptors at  the court of Lorenzo de' Medici. On the  mantel is a late 15 th century marble bust  of a Venetian Senator recognizable from  his costume and from the style of wearing his hair. As you face the mantel,  note on either side at this end of the hall  two massive and exquisitely carved creel enze of the late 16 th century. These  are of different sizes but similar in design.  The large tapestry above the chimney  piece is of the mid-16th century, woven  at Tournai in France. On a ground of  tiny flowers are applied armorial medallions framing rustic scenes. On the north  wall hang two mythological Ferrarese  tapestries, at one time the property of the  poet Robert Browning. They hung in his  villa at Asolo, Italy, and the red horse in  the tapestry at the right prompted the  passage in his poem, "Childe Roland to  the Dark Tower Came."  On the south wall is an impressive  portrait of Count Francisco de Altamira,  a citizen of the province of Vizcaya in  Spain.    It was painted by Carreno  da  Miranda in the 17th century and is shown  in its original frame.  On the east wall are two family portraits. Painted in 1625, one is of Sir  Edward Dering — the first Baronet of  the name, who belonged to an English  family known as the Surrenden Derings.  The companion portrait is of Lady Dering (Anne Ashburnham). Below these  two portraits is a pair of Italian chests,  inscribed with the date 1585.  Leaving the Banquet Hall you proceed  through the south corridor, which was  used as a serving pantry, the doors  painted with 18 th century arabesques.  The console top is in the varicolored  "paste" which this period adopted to  imitate the more costly inlays of the  Granducal tables.  The Tea Room  THIS room opens upon the South  Terrace and the Garden. Its cool  walls display the fantastic imagination of the artists of Naples at the end  of the 18 th century. The Neapolitans  were the most expert scene painters in  the world, and each of these pictures is  like a stage setting—extravagant, imaginative and spacious. Such painted decorations, copied in wall paper, spread to  every land and finally became as popular  in Salem, Massachusetts, as in Paris and  Zurich. The legends here come from the  Iliad and show the sack and destruction  of Troy.  Note the light Venetian furniture in  cool colors inspired by Greek designs;  the pair of 18 th century French terra  cotta statues of Chinese figures holding  flower jars.

The great gateway opposite, with marble frame and gates of wrought iron,  came from the Palace of Pisani, that  Venetian family to whom Vizcaya owes  many inspirations. A masterpiece of late  17th century design, it is one of the most  impressive sights in the House and  should be carefully noted.  Through this gateway you next pass  into the South Arcade and the  Tatio  IN the North and South Arcades, as  well as in the Patio itself, you see  clearly the simple and sturdy arches,  vaults and columns which are the basis  of Italian Renaissance architecture. Here,  with a fine feeling for true Renaissance  proportions, they are constructed of the  warm and rough-textured local coralline  limestone. The floors are old Cuban  tiles.  The busts over the doors in both  North and South Arcades are of the 16th  century and represent members of the  Visconti Family, famous for their distinguished sons, some of whom became  Dukes of Milan.  In the arcades are photographs of  watercolors of Vizcaya by John Singer  Sargent (1856-1925), made while a  guest here in 1917.  The courtyard is planted with an interesting variety of tropical trees and  shrubs. The Dolphin Fountain and its  marble basin are Italian of the 17th century. They have been combined with antique marble columns and ironwork in  which the Caravel again appears — this  time   associated   with   the   pineapple,  a  symbol of hospitality. This court was  used for much of Mr. Deering's informal  entertaining and was the scene of frequent family gatherings.  Visitors are invited to sit here, rest,  visit and smoke if they wish, before proceeding to the upstairs rooms. These are  reached by the  &lt;£Main Stairway  ON the landing is a 17th century  Roman statue in a niche, "Pan  Carrying a Lamb."  On reaching the upper gallery, turn  left and enter the  Quest Room "Cathay"  THIS is one of the two guest rooms  open to the public. The room is  done in the Chinese manner as it  appeared to the gay and playful spirit of  the 18 th century. The gaily painted furniture and the spritely flowered Chinese  wall panels are a perfect support to the  fantasy of the whimsically tasseled and  feathered bed canopy and the painted  wood vase which is used for a lamp.  Rarely does one see the ephemeral spirit  of the Rococo so completely captured as  in this gay little Oriental fantasy. The  furniture is largely Italian, but the rug  is Chinese.  Returning to the gallery, you next  come (in the northeast corner) to the  door of  &lt;tMr. Deering's Sitting Room  THIS room is a superb example of  the late 18th century love for a restrained classical style, the complete  antithesis of the bedroom we have just  seen and of the Music Room and Marie 		image/tiff						50927550 Bytes	3530	4809	528467378	RGB	8	600	asc99990000360013001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1612	1612	1613.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1613.jp2

Here the colors  are restricted to white and gold, with a  delicate and controlled ornament which  we find echoed in the pattern of the  handsome   and   unique  silk  hangings.  The furniture is of the style generally  called Directoire, which followed rather  strictly the classical models discovered at  Pompeii and elsewhere in Italy during  the 18 th century. This style led almost  imperceptibly into that of the Empire,  which was also severely classical.  Aside from the paneling and wall coverings, the chief interest in this room  centers on the magnificent and unique  oval carpet, which is of French manufacture, made at La Savonnerie. This type is  easily identified since it was woven with  a pile. The signs of the Zodiac appear as  part of the central motif.  We next pass through the dressing  room where there is a photograph of the  watercolor portrait of Mr. Deering by  Sargent, inscribed "To Mr. James Deering from his friend John S. Sargent,  Miami 1917."  sfflr. Deering9s Bedroom  HERE the style is more strictly Empire with a very notable bed, elaborately ornamented in plaques of  gilt bronze. The fireplace is surrounded  by a white marble mantel, after a design  by the Adams brothers, with inlays of  color. The rug is again a most interesting  and unusual example, made in France  at the Aubusson factory and using the  technique of tapestry weaving. The desk  of maple burl is in the German version  of the Empire style. The superbly carved  and gilt wood round table and pedestals  are among the finest pieces of their kind.  £Mr. Deering9s Bath  THIS is the most elaborate bathroom  in the house and a magnificent example of Empire design, using rare  European marbles and highlighted with  silver plated urns and vases which carry  out the classical theme. Of particular interest is the unusual shaving stand and  mirror. One should also note the tentlike embroidered ceiling cloth, which was  designed and made by Mr. Paul Chalfin.  We now return through the bedroom and  re-enter the gallery.  Continuing to the left, we come to the  Quest Room "Espagnolette"  IN spite of its name, this room is  almost entirely furnished with the lacquered and gilded furniture which is  characteristic of Venice and based on the  curved lines of French furniture of the  period of Louis XV. The gaily painted  wall panels are French and repeat favorite themes of 18th century fetes galantes.  One rarely sees furniture of this period  or a bed complete with hangings displayed in the sort of room for which  they were designed. The interesting rug  is from the Orient, but made in imitation of  18 th century European designs.  Continuing along the upstairs gallery  to the south side, one comes to the entrance of the  Upstairs Dining Room  TO enter this room, one goes up several steps, past four large Chinese  pottery "Foo" dogs, through a pair  of gilded wrought-iron gates of the 18 th  century only slightly less handsome than 		image/tiff						50061930 Bytes	3470	4809	220191192	RGB	8	600	asc99990000360014001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1613	1613	1614.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1614.jp2

These are also Italian and hung in a 16th  century stone doorway with darker stone  inlays.  The dining room is lined with large  marine paintings by Carl Vernet (French,  1758-1836). We find again a magnificent inlaid floor of antique marbles. The  red lacquered chairs are Venetian and the  fireplace has a Chippendale mantel with  the space over it treated in his chinoiserie  style—a favorite way for English gentlemen to display their Chinese curios. The  lacquer screen is also Chinese.  From the windows of this room there  is an excellent view of the great formal  gardens to the south, with the Casino as  a crowning feature of the Mound.  You now return along the gallery to a  wrought-iron door which opens on to the  Circular Stairway  THESE remarkably constructed stairs  with their elegant wrought-iron and  brass balustrade lead up to the  tower rooms (not shown) and down to  the ground floor. It is suggested that  before starting down, you look along the  stair well to the delightful circle of antique marble inlay at the bottom.  Turn to the left pausing again in the  Patio if you wish, and turn through the  Tea Room to the  South Terrace  ON this terrace it is impressive to  reflect that what lies before you  was, not long ago, a f latT and  dreary marsh of coarse swamp grass extending to the south. Just in front of you  is a fountain basin, featuring a Roman  sarcophagus and ornamented with lead  lizards and frogs, designed and executed  by Charles Cary Rumsey (American,  1879-1922).  Below the broad steps in front of you,  on left and right, are half circular fountains and small vine-clad summer houses  joined by hedges with old marble and  limestone columns bearing busts and antique urns from Sicily. Just preceding the  semicircular fountains you will find to  the right an archway which leads into  the Refreshment Stand and Rest Rooms,  and to the left an archway which leads  to the Secret Garden.  However, since the motor tram which  will take you back to the Main Gate has  its terminus at the far end of the Formal  Gardens near the Mound, it is suggested  that before exploring in that direction  you turn left toward the bay front and  The Sea Wall  nri,  ^HIS curving basin is deep enough  I for large boats. Here the interior  furnishings for the House were discharged from a schooner in 1915. Here  seafaring yachts have berthed, their lights  illuminating the water at night. A great  stone Barge that never moves—decorated  with sculptures symbolizing the delights  and terrors of the sea, the fruits and trees  of the tropics—protects a space of calm  water at the foot of the water steps, so  that the smallest craft is safe here. Tall  obelisks afford a contrast to the distant,  level sea line. All the sculpture on this  Barge was designed by A. Stirling Calder  (1870-1945), well known for his monumental works.

The sun dial in the center bears  a Latin inscription, translated as "Happy  Heart, seize the gifts of the hour that  is here, and Harsh Heart, leave them."  The sea wall is completed at each end  by bridges in the Venetian manner, over  small lagoons. One bridge leads to a latticed tea house and the other to the yacht  landing.  At the farther north end below the  balustrade before the House, turn sharply  to the left and you will come to the  Swimming Pool  THE water here is delivered from  lead dragons just over the edge of  the platform on which you stand.  Swimmers may bask in the sun in the  sand pile opposite, or swim in the shade  beneath the arches. This feature is unique.  Visitors will be able to catch a glimpse  of the wall panels under the arches,  which are picked out with patterns of  delicately colored sea shells and of a  fantastic ceiling molded, sculptured, and  painted by the late Robert W. Chanler  (1872-1930).  Retracing your steps back to the Sea  Wall and again passing the east facade of  the House, you will come to the arched  opening of the  Secret Garden  THIS   high-walled   and  protected  garden is typical of Italian garden  design in that it is largely architectural, with plants used in carpet-like beds  or sculptured wall pockets. The vine-  covered stairs with their wrought-iron  railings lead to a high platform which is  one of the many elevated vantage points  for seeing the large central Formal Garden. At the back of the Secret Garden  are two grottos secluded from the blazing  sun and cool with the drip of water. You  may leave the Secret Garden by the archway opposite the one by which you entered, which leads around a semicircular  fountain basin to a terrace walk, or you  may leave it by the passage and arch  between the grottos and go immediately  into the  Formal Garden  A CENTRAL feature of this broad  and impressive garden is the raised  central pool surrounding an elevated island, again bringing to mind the  garden of the Villa Lante. Along two  sides of the pool are clipped live oaks,  contrasting with the freer masses of the  live oaks on the Mound. The floor of  the garden is elaborately patterned with  low, clipped hedges against a background  of pure white sand. This is in the manner  of French gardens, though the device  dates back to Roman times. The jasmine  hedge plant (Jasminum simplicifolium)  is the subtropical equivalent for European box, which it closely resembles.  To the right and left are sloping terraces emphasized by thick, clipped hedges  of Australian pine (Casuarina Cunning-  hamiana). Above these are terrace walks  where one can look down and see to advantage again the patterns of the garden  below.

There are also urns  and vases, most of which come from  Italy, though many are French in origin.  Theater Garden  THIS is entered through the larger  of the two pairs of wrought-iron  gates on the east terrace walk. It  is a garden in the form of a verdure  theater rather than a place intended for  actual performances. The wings are of  clipped pine and its seats of turf, as is  its orchestra floor. In miniature it is  derived from the Villa Gori near Siena.  Tea Garden  nr*  'HIS circular palm garden was de-  1 signed for serving tea out of doors.  In the center is a breche violet column, similar to many other fine antique  marble columns elsewhere in the Gardens,  as well as in the House. On the right is  a Florentine marble table of the mid-16th  century, the first Granducal period. The  rich foliage of the mangrove swamp provides an effective background for this  garden.  Fountain Garden  THE beautiful central structure formerly supplied water to the little  town of Bassano di Sutri, not far  from Rome. The castle of Caprarola, the  masterpiece of Vignola, was near by. This  ancient fountain is in Vignola's manner,  Baroque at its noblest. The stone of the  basins is the famous travertine, of which  Rome was largely built.  To the left in this garden is a semicircular fountain with a row  of little  African merboys conceived in the 18th  century manner, and as a central feature,  a lead statue of Narcissus. Continuing  along the edge of the garden to the  right there is a small, white marble Roman bath planted with flowers. Farther  along, in the same direction, there is a  well preserved pagan altar from the  Roman period, formerly the property of  the Borghese Family.  On either side is a square column of  Lombardic work, about 1100 A.D., with  panels of knotted tracery and crowned  with semibarbaric approximations of the  Corinthian capital. Beyond this lies the  "O" Bridge, or  "Peacock Bridge  THE walk leads to the bridge, ornamented with Peacocks—symbol of  India. They surmount fine encircled  twisting Oriental columns, supposed type  of those of the Praetorium in Jerusalem.  The Peacocks are the work of Gaston La  Chaise (1882-1935).  The Oriental feeling is continued in  the high arch of the bridge, which with  its reflection in the water on a calm day  produces a perfect oval. At either end of  the bridge are pools of water, the side  walls ornamented with panels of seashells  laid in patterns.

Looking below you from the balcony,  you will see a series of steps leading  to a Venetian water landing with gaily  painted gondola baulks. Another fascinating grotto, featuring gigantic masks  with hair and beards ingeniously made of  rough coral rock, will be found under  the Casino.  The Mound itself provides vistas in  all directions. The cool shade of the live  oaks and the splash of its many water jets  invite the visitor to linger and study the  pattern of the gardens below from these  many vantage points.  To the sides are ample stairs leading  down on one hand to the Fountain Garden and on the other to the Garden Plaza,  near which you will find the garden  terminus of the motor tram, where you  can have transportation back to the Main  Gate. These stairs have each a pair of  narrow tracks, originally built in Italian  gardens to accommodate the wheels of  carts used to haul away leaves and other  garden trimmings.  On the side toward the House will be  seen the  Water Stairway  AT the top of this double stairway  is a delicate fountain of yellowish  marble reflecting the taste of the  16th century. Its water falls into a circular basin and then drops to the lower  level through a series of basins. The  dripping water from the edges of these  basins is constantly renewed by pairs of  jets which throw long streams of water  to the level just above.  At the foot of the Water Stairway are  two richly sculptured grottos with dramatic giants who hold up a great burden  of rock. There are small fountains within  where a gentle drip of water adds to  the cool contrast. Here again a decorative  pattern of sea shells may be observed.  %eturn to Main Gate  npi  1!  ' HE motor tram for the return trip  to the Main Gate may be picked  up at its garden terminus near the  Mound. For those who wish to return by  foot in the shade of a typical Florida  hammock, there is an informal woodland  path. Enter the path near the Refreshment Stand and mount by a gentle slope  to the Plaza. To continue on the woodland path, re-enter it by the side of the  large statue of Bal. Vizcaya in the Plaza,  eventually crossing a road, and arriving  finally at the Main Gate.  The material in this guide (except for that covering the upstairs rooms) has been  adapted from the guide compiled in 1933 hy Robert B. Harshe, the late Director  of The Art Institute of Chicagos and Daniel Catton Rich, its present Director.

The answer lies, literally,  just over the southern horizon—in magical Miami, heart  of the only truly tropical area in the United States, the  southernmost tip of Florida. Here is a city of contrasts—  of gay diversions and quiet pleasures—of hotels, clubs  and casinos in the "grand manner", of great estates and  cozy Florida-Spanish homes—a land where surf-bathing,  golf and tennis are "winter" sports. Miami is a complete  city, offering a full range of living facilities, and your  standard of living will cost you much the same here as in  comparable cities "back home". But in Miami's greater  gifts lies the premium that makes life here so much more  worth living—the gifts of carefree outdoor play—of constant sea breezes, warm in winter, cool in summer—of  action, life and gaiety, things to see and things to do  around the clock, or just restful quiet throughout the year.  And over all is the paramount gift of sunshine—sunshine  that adds a golden aura to everything you do—health-  building, gloom-chasing sunshine that makes Miami  unique—the only place of its kind "under the sun".  7llLa.mL'!L fl  Ti-eunote:  I B  1   I  ■■&lt;■  111   1 	Text	image/tiff						39630180 Bytes	2404	5495	1236566753	RGB	8	600	asc99990000440004001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1625	1625	1626.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1626.jp2

Here everyone plays  . . . outdoors. Healthy, hearty exercise  fills the warm June-like days with carefree pastimes for young and old. Below  are briefly outlined some of the activities that are deadly enemies of boredom,  games that will make your Miami hours  fly by on golden wings:  life  EIGHT FULL COURSES in the Miami area — palm-lined  fairways and velvet greens. Four grand public links . . .  and, in hospitable Miami, private clubs, too, welcome the  transient guest.  THE CITY MAINTAINS extensive courts in six great  public parks. Private courts augment these facilities in  providing ample room for all. Lighted courts for night  play.  MIAMI'S EXCELLENT recreation department supervises  extensive "park sport" layouts—where "oldsters", particularly, find cronies for companionship or competition.  Horseshoes, checkers and chess, shuffleboard, etc., are, of  course, standard but additional courts are provided for  such rarer pastimes as roque and "bowling-on-the-green".  EIGHT MILES OF OCEAN BEACH, where water temperatures are in the 70's all year, (thanks to the Gulf Stream  just offshore) are available for year round surf-bathing.  Standard practice is to dress at home without bother of  lockers or bath houses, because beach and bathing togs  are commonplace in Miami.  EXCELLENT STABLES of the area provide gaited saddle-  horses for picturesque tropic trails. Riding hereabouts  is particularly popular among the ladies.  OUTDOOR BOWLING IS popular. Alleys, lighted for  night games, are a favorite rendezvous of old and young  alike, while "leagues" add a competitive zest.  BISCAYNE BAY, each winter, sees the world's greatest  concentration of pleasure craft. Whether you bring your  own boat via the Inland Waterway, or take advantage  of varied local facilities, you'll find many sunny hours  afloat waiting in sparkling tropic waters.

Here fishing is an adventure for everyone—thrills in the battles  of the big ones—and sheer amazement at the curious  shapes and varied hues of strange tropic varieties that  succumb to the lure of your bait. Principal satisfaction  of fishing here is that fish are really caught—often in  record numbers. Causeways, bridges, docks and seawalls  are dotted day and night with ambitious anglers. Variety  is found at night in novel "jack-light" expeditions for  shrimp and crawfish. For those who take their fishing  seriously, excursions to the Gulf Stream, all-day or weekend trips among the fabulous Florida Keys, or jaunts out  the Tamiami Trail where the canals of the Everglades  teem with fresh-water varieties, are always popular.  Whether you're a rank amateur or a hardened expert,  you'll find thrills galore in fishing tropic Miami waters.

Bring your own or pick up the  necessary extras at Miami's many excellent  shops and stores. Tournaments and contests,  climaxed by the Metropolitan Miami Fishing Tournament from mid-January to April,  lend a competitive zest—-but it's more in the  Miami mood to get on your old clothes whenever the  spirit moves you and just "go fishin'".  m  SAILFISH, MARLIN, DOLPHIN, Tuna, Bonita, Kingfish,  Amber jack and Barracuda headline the "heavyweight"  division. Grouper, Snapper, Trout, Mackerel, Bluefish  and Pompano are the most common smaller fish. Tarpon,  Bass and Robalo are the leading "inland water" catches.  653  VARIETIES  GREATER MIAMI'S FLEET of sport fishing boats for char-    charter  ter trips is the largest and best equipped in the world.       boats  Arrangements  may  be  made   at  the  Municipal  Yacht  Basin.  NO EXPERIENCE NECESSARY.  Trained guides know the     trained  best "holes", tides, baits, etc., and furnish all tackle and      guides  equipment with instructions as to use and special technique.  NO LICENSE IS REQUIRED for saltwater fishing in any licenses  form. Special licenses for freshwater fishing ($1.75) are (personal)  obtained at City Hall.  THE GULF STREAM is some 20 minutes offshore, reached  only by boat. Causeways and bridges in Biscayne Bay  are mostly equipped with fishing platforms and sidewalks.  An Ocean Pier is lighted for night as well as daytime use.  The Keys are reached either by boat, or by car where  interconnecting bridges, docks and fishing camps are  available for "terra firma" fishing. Fresh waters are  reached by car over Tamiami Trail and other paved highways.  BECAUSE THE GULF STREAM keeps water temperatures  almost the same at all times, virtually all varieties including sailfish are caught the year round. However,  special seasons when certain fish seem to bite better than  others are as follows: Tuna, March through June; Tarpon, Spring and Summer months; Marlin (Swordfish),  April through June.  principal  FISHING  GROUNDS  FISHING  SEASONS 	Text	image/tiff						39959880 Bytes	2424	5495	2903238105	RGB	8	600	asc99990000440009001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1630	1630	1631.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1631.jp2

For those  who seek quieter and more serious diversions, Miami offers the normal social  and cultural life of any cosmopolitan American city—  theatres, concerts, musicals, lectures, clubs, etc. There is,  of course, an added aura lent by leaders in virtually  every field of music, arts, letters and science, who visit  Miami or have permanent homes here. Of particular  interest is Miami's development as a center for Pan  American relations. Closest U. S. city to South America,  and having a considerable Latin American colony, Miami  is active in fostering the interchange of ideas, as well as  trade and commerce, between the Americas. Friendl)/  Miami, too, realizes the pleasure her visitors derive from  "back home" acquaintances. Her Civic Centre provides  "get-together" gatherings among residents and visitors, is  active in organizing clubs for those hailing from the same  state, and conducts bridge parties, dances and other  social activities in a comprehensive recreational urogram.

Those  who by choice or necessity do not  indulge in strenuous pastimes will  still find plenty to engage their attention. Listed briefly here are some of  the more important factors in Miami's  social, cultural and religious life.  MIAMI HAS 91 CHURCHES representing virtually every   churches  denomination, who welcome visitors to their services and  community activities.  WOMEN'S SOCIAL, civic and professional organizations  are an integral part of the life of Miami. Outstanding  and progressive, these groups welcome visitors and are  glad to have them share in their entertainment programs  and other functions.  WOMEN s  CLUBS  MIAMI'S PUBLIC LIBRARIES have more than 32,000 public  volumes listed. The University of Miami is an additional library  source for research and reading in specialized fields.  ENTIRELY SOCIAL AND SOCIABLE in their conception,  "home state" clubs flourish in Miami. Those interested  should register at the Miami Chamber of Commerce,  Civic Centre Building on arrival.

MIAMI'S BEAUTIFUL Municipal Amphitheatre in breeze-  swept Bayfront Park, with a capacity of 6,000, is the  center for concerts, pageants, operas, lectures and recitals.

It offers  living costs in line with accepted standards—plus a priceless premium of mental and physical well-being which  permeates the very air here. In plain words, all the  glamour and excitement, the health and climatic advantages—all "Miami" stands for, costs you not one cent.  Facilities for approximately 150,000 visitors at a time are available  in the Miami area, assuring a wide choice. Rates naturally favor  those who plan a longer stay on the same principles that allow  "wholesale" rates in merchandise. Rates and prices quoted here are,  of necessity, very general.  "Minimum" accommodations usually fill first, and in the peak  season, visitors sometimes find prices slightly higher—not because  they are raised but because only premium accommodations remain.  Visitors in November, December, April and May will find plenty of  fine accommodations at minimum rates, while special "summer  rates" are even lower.  7Hode&gt;iat-e  ~VCLCCLtLOVL  [1    fl    f  i  ■■■■■■ fp |i  I   I   tl  AMUSEMENT COSTS:  Public Courses Club Courses  Summer     Winter   Summer Winter  Greens Fees (All day)    50c      $1.00    $1.00    $2.50-$3.00  Public Courses        Club Courses  Caddy Fares (Per 18 holes)    75c to $1.00 $1.00  Individual Charter Boats—Party of 4 to 6 persons, average rate $20 to $35 all day.

There's health in Miami's  sunshine and solar-marine climate, not only in direct  benefits but indirectly in fresh foods and fruits which  grow the year round—in stimulating exercise which is  an inevitable by-product of so much outdoor living.  Miami is ideal for small homes for those of retirement age, and its proximity to the North makes it doubly  suitable as a winter residence for families whose head  must remain in contact with business interests there.  Evidence of this trend is furnished by the tremendous  number of such dwellings included in Miami's impressive  building program which has been averaging over $1,000,-  000 a month. Look at these delightful homes when you  come to Miami this year. They can easily mark a change  for the better in your entire way of living.  £Jdea£  £LvivLg  THE 	Text	image/tiff						39300480 Bytes	2384	5495	1529619262	RGB	8	600	asc99990000440014001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1635	1635	1636.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1636.jp2

Thousands of available sites, liberal  housing loans and other factors make  this year particularly suitable for having  your dreams of "a place in the sun"  come true.  THOUSANDS OF FULLY  IMPROVED city lots in lovely homesites  residential sections are available.   Costs today are moderate—a reflection of sound property values.  AUTHORITIES ESTIMATE that a comfortable "livable"  house can be built within Miami city limits for about  $3,000. From this minimum, prices rise to the great  homes of the very wealthy. Rigid zoning restrictions  assure your home of suitable surroundings in the future.  MIAMI'S PUBLIC SCHOOLS have highest accredited rating. Children may enter on arrival and leave at any time  with no fear of loss in standing. There are many fine  private schools. Innovations such as outdoor classes  stimulate interest and study. The University of Miami  rounds out a complete educational system.  MIAMI'S HOSPITALS and sanitaria are excellent and nationally renowned, particularly in developments of sun-  ray treatments and helio-therapy.  FLORIDA LAW aids small-home owners by exempting  those up to $5,000 from state taxes.  FLORIDA HAS NO State Income or State Inheritance Tax,  a strong factor in favor of permanent residence here.  MIAMI'S POPULATION and progress curves are steadily  rising, indicating prosperity and good times in business.  Miami discourages transient and shoestring enterprises,  but offers unusual opportunities in small businesses,  manufactures, commerce and agriculture to those with  a small amount of capital to invest.  PRIME FACTOR IN Miami's favor as a permanent winter  residence for families, is its proximity to the North.  Little more than a day away by fast train, and within 8  hours of New York or Chicago by plane, business men  find it practical to close northern homes during the expensive winter months, establish their families here and  visit them frequently over week-ends—literally "commuting" between Winter and Summer.

Coconut palms grow wild — not as carefully  nursed rarities. Royal palms thrive. Exotic tropic blooms  and flowering shrubs are everywhere, and the great Royal  Poincianas become trees of flame in May and June. Mock]  ing birds sing everywhere, and rare species of tropic birdJ  with brilliant plumage flash in the sunlight.

Temperatures even in mid-summeJ  seldom reach 90°. Winter average is 68.1° and the year]  round mean is in the middle seventies. Watch the temJ  perature reports in your daily papers.

For the wallet-weary visitor these pages offer moderately priced efficiency apartments,  delightful hotel rooms ... for the Sun Worshipper of ample means, accommodations of  Continental luxury and modern comfort . . . for the wealthy visitor, palatial suites of kinglike splendor. Miami Beach is famed the world over for its extensive accommodations.  Whatever the taste, wherever the location, whatever the atmosphere, whatever the price—it  will be discovered among the superb collection offered herein.  The Miami Beach Chamber of Commerce publishes each year a refined, expensively  printed booklet to aid the resort-curious in their selection of hotel and apartment accommodations—this is the 1939-40 edition. Won't you mention this publication when writing  or wiring the hotels and apartment houses appearing within these covers?  We hope your stay in Miami Beach will be one of the most thrilling, pleasurable  adventures of your life . . . and we feel certain it will.  Lying alongside the rolling Atlantic like a scintillating jeweled necklace, Miami Beach  is set deep in the American tropics—almost 300 miles farther south than Cairo, Egypt.  Most cosmopolitan of New World resorts, this streamlined south sea island is ablaze with  a fairyland profusion of Spanish, French, Mediterranean and moderne architecture, spiced  with inimitable tropical beauty.  The island is linked to metropolitan Miami by three ribbon:like causeways across  limpid Biscayne Bay, includes sixteen small man-made islands, dotted with hotels, apartment houses, pretentious estates and modest homes, is criss-crossed by calm Venetian waterways which wind along palm-fringed roadways. Less than a mile and one-half at its  broadest point, the island provides easy access to both ocean and bay.  Famed as a resort among resorts, Miami Beach is renowned as a playground—dog  racing, surf and pool bathing, fashion shows, bicycling, yacht and sailboat regattas, motoring, golfing on palm-studded fairways, superb bay and deep sea fishing, tennis, sun bathing,  boating, water sports, horse racing tracks within a few miles, bowling, park recreations,  canoeing, modern first-run theatres and the gay, throbbing nightlife that is a thrilling blend  of Broadway, South America and the Continent.  Curricula of public and private schools at Miami Beach are specially arranged for  transfer-adjustments, offering full academic credit with a background of comfort and health.  School buildings are sun-conditioned, windows flung wide-open to vitalizing sunlight and  ocean breezes—a healthful atmosphere of contentment conducive to undisturbed, enjoyable  study.  Yet Miami Beach is a modern Southern city: efficiently-operated hospitals, a complete  library, eight churches, exclusive shops rivaling those of the Rue de la Paix, daily-tested  water supply, public parks with lush tropical verdure, one of the southeast's finest art galleries, municipal golf courses, city-manager and councilmanic government, fully accredited  schools, an extensive transportation system within the city and to Miami, a bronzed corps  of competent lifeguards, full fire and police protection ... all conveniences of an up-to-date  city, yet the charm and ease of a southern resort city.  Old World charm . . . New World convenience . . . tropical beauty and southern  hospitality . . . this is Miami Beach!

It is not only as a resort  that the place has gained fame, however, for business journals likewise devote much space to  it, and to investors and capitalists Florida means "Miami."  LOCATION. Miami is the most southern city on the  mainland of the United States. This means that it is  in the sub-tropical zone, and therefore comes under  the benign influence of the soft air, gorgeous foliage and  rich vegetation of the tropics while escaping entirely  the too severe heat and enervating lassitude of the  realms to the south.  Miami is 366 miles south of Jacksonville, on Biscayne Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, at the mouth of  the Miami River. A more fortunate location as to  natural beauty could scarcely be imagined; a fact which  was thoroughly recognized by Henry M. Flagler and  his associates, the empire  builders who pushed the  steel ribbon of the railroad through the wilderness years  ago and saw here the potential possibilities for a large  and prosperous city. Even their wildest dreams have  been far surpassed by the realities, and still the city is  yet in its youth with all the future before it.  POPULATION. The last city directory gives Miami a  permanent population of 25,000; but one edition of this  book is scarcely off the press before the number is increased by a thousand or more. It is greatly augmented  each year from the hordes of visitors who come during  the winter season, a large percentage of whom are certain  to fall victims to the city's spell and decide to call it  home. Between 40,000 and 50,000 people constitute the  ?\  &gt;A .'

Ill HI IIIIs  S#ii  fixed winter population of Miami, while it is freely estimated that the number of tourists who stop here for a  long or short time during the season far exceeds 100,000.  Washed in a constant flood of golden sunshine, the  city typifies cleanliness, both in its physical and moral  aspects, and here may be found every advantage and  desirable feature for wholesome family life, while for  those in search of recreation there is no need to go  farther.  CLIMATE. Climatically, Miami leaves nothing to be  desired. While much has been said and written already  on this subject, it cannot be reiterated too often that  Miami has the highest absolute minimum winter temperature of any city in the United States, with the  exception of Key West, and that its maximum summer  temperature is one of the lowest.  Equability is the great feature of this climate and  is the reason for much of its charm. Records kept by  the United States Weather Bureau office in Miami  show that the annual mean temperature is 75.4 degrees  with the average for the summer months 81.4, and for  the winter 69 degrees. The absolute maximum is 96  degrees and there are only an average of 11 days in the  year when the temperature reaches 90 or above. The  average percentage of the possible amount of sunshine is 61, which is an exceedingly high figure as may  be proven easily by comparison with statistics from  any other place in the United States. Practically all  of the rainfall is between May and October, thus  contributing to the comfort and coolness of the sum  mer months as well as adding to the delights of the  winter.  A winter or a year in Miami means summer clothing the year around, constant surroundings of green  trees and flowers, fresh fruits and vegetables always  obtainable, open air sports every day in the year, refreshing sleep at night, and, in fact, the constant enjoyment of the good, wholesome things in life—the things  that are really worth while.  HOTEL LIFE. One of the things which impresses a  visitor to Miami is the sincere and cordial welcome given  him and the pains taken to make him comfortable. In  spite of the constant construction of new apartment  houses, hotels and dwellings, congestion threatens yearly  but is averted by the heroic efforts of the business men  and the hearty cooperation of the householders, so  that there is always room found for one more.  Hotel life in Miami is delightful, for the hostelries  have all been built with a view to the solid comfort of  guests. The homelike atmosphere which prevails is  most pleasing. Any pocketbook, from the one which  contains millions down to the one which must hoard  pennies carefully, may be suited for accommodations.  It is in the hotels that the social life of the city  centers during the winter season. Gay dinner parties,  brilliant balls, informal teas, or a quiet game of bridge  are the order of the days and nights. Spacious grounds  around the principal hotels add greatly to their beauty  and all are equipped with commodious verandas where  a lazy hour may be spent.

Outdoor tea  dances under the waving cocoanut palms, amid the  fragrance of flowers in January and February, provide  a unique pleasure which appeals especially to one just  coming from the ice and snow of the North.  On the tables are found fresh vegetables to tempt  the jaded appetite, rare fruits, sea foods fresh from the  briny deep, all served with the finish and care of the  most exclusive places of the North. Service is the  watchword of these hotels and it is given cheerfully  and willingly.  For those who prefer a more quiet life, there are  smaller family hotels, many first-class boarding houses,  or as has been indicated, private homes which are  thrown open that the visitor may be made comfortable.  Apartment houses are constantly being built and  the effort to keep up with the demand for this sort of  accommodation is a strenuous one. It is believed that  another season will see the crying need for apartments  amply filled. They are provided with every modern  accommodation.  OUTDOOR SPORTS. Of outdoor sports there is no  end. Swimming, automobiling, aeroplaning, golf, tennis,  boating, fishing, baseball, hunting, or even the humble  game of quoits, furnishes something for every age and  taste. For those who prefer to let some one else get the  muscular exercise, there are the usual amusements of a  city, moving picture shows, entertainments, lectures,  musicals, and, during the season, twice daily concerts by  one of the best bands in the country in the Royal Palm  Park. Last year the first attempt was made to give the  daily band concerts and nothing has ever proven so popular, or given so much pleasure to the visitors. Weekly  water sports in the casino are also an attraction.  SWIMMING. For swimming, one may either stay in  Miami and indulge in this pastime at the Royal Palm  casino, where, during the fashionable bathing hour, from  eleven to twelve, there is orchestra music and all society  is in evidence, or one may go to Miami Beach.  Miami Beach is located on the narrow peninsula  which separates Biscayne Bay and the ocean and is  reached either by ferry or by bridge, and within a year  will be accessible by street car over the magnificent  causeway which the city and county are building across  the bay at a cost of $600,000. It is an incorporated  town, laid out artistically and represents one of the  most remarkable developments in the South, for much  of the land was literally created by being dredged from  the bottom of the bay. What was a mangrove jungle  three years ago is now a garden spot covered with grass,  trees, palms, flowers and dotted with beautiful homes.  On the beach are three casinos with bath houses  of the most modern type and in connection with them  are four sanitary swimming pools for those who do not  care for the surf. Life guards and swimming instructors  are in attendance.  Surf bathing is an unalloyed delight at this spot.  The water, warmed by the sun and by the Gulf Stream,  which flows just three miles off shore, is always at a  comfortable temperature so that there is no danger 	Text	image/tiff						78722598 Bytes	4829	5434	2917916900	RGB	8	600	asc99990000190008001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1691	1691	1692.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1692.jp2

The breakers  are never too strong, and a reef some distance out protects the beach so that the insidious undertow which  mars so many bathing beaches, is missing. A fringe  of palms skirts the shore and strikes a picturesque note  in the ensemble which is enhanced by the quaint  old Dutch windmill at one of the casinos. Travelers  declare that the coloring in the water here is the most  beautiful to be found anywhere in the world.  AUTOMOBILING. For the motorist, 600 miles of  rock-surfaced, oil-coated roads radiate in every direction from Miami. These are lined with trees and flowering shrubs and take the traveler through the famous  fruit-growing districts, out to the winter vegetable gardens, or to the Everglades, along highways teeming with  interesting sights.  DIXIE HIGHWAY. Miami is the terminus of the  Dixie Highway, that great thoroughfare which links the  North and South. The Tamiami Trail, now under construction, will connect this city with Tampa on the West  Coast, forming the first trans-state road in Southern  Florida, crossing the Everglades for forty miles. To the  south extends the Ingraham Highway leading to the  wonderful Royal Palm State Park, a spot saved to posterity through the efforts of the women's clubs and  pronounced by scientists to be one of the most remarkable reservations in the world in its flora, fauna and  bird life.  AEROPLANING. Air conditions here are ideal for  flying and Miami has been selected as a site for a branch  school of the U. S. Navy. The Curtiss school of aviation  also has a branch here for training experts in this line.  GOLF. Two years ago the golf enthusiast did not even  consider Miami, but today he or she rushes here, realizing that on the Miami Beach eighteen-hole golf course  there is sport to be found surpassing that on many of  the oldest courses in the country. This course is one  of the magical works in a magical country, for it was  created out of what looked to be a hopeless tract of  sand. Today its sod is as firm as could possibly be  desired, and it has been laid out by one of the great  golf experts of the country. Hazards, bunkers, greens,  faraways—with clusters of palms here and there—they  are all first class. The course is 6088 yards with bogey  81 and par 75. The putting greens are of Bermuda  grass, making a contrast to many other courses in the  South. An artistic clubhouse with all accommodations is at the disposal of the players. A nine-hole  course is laid out nearer the city.  TENNIS. Tennis is fast becoming one of the most  popular winter sports here and many private courts are  being built in the grounds of spacious homes. There are  ten municipal courts, all kept in good condition, where  one may play at any time, and in addition there are  several courts at Miami Beach and in hotel grounds.  Part of the courts are paved with concrete and others  with fine clay, making them speedy and pleasant to  play upon. Annual tournaments with some of the  crack players of the country as special attractions help  maintain interest in the game.  POINT VIEW SUBDIVISION, MIAMI  MIRAMAR SUBDIVISION.

Deer, quail and other game are to be  found in abundance in the pine woods southwest of  the city, some distance out, and during the season  sportsmen find the chase full of zest and interest.  AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES. Miami is the center and market for an agricultural empire. The city is  the logical gateway for the vast resources of the Florida  Everglades, which will in the course of a few years be  developed through the drainage operations into one of  the greatest fruit, vegetable and stock-raising sections of  the United States. Important drainage measures were  passed by the last legislature and two large drainage  districts have been formed near Miami already, to bring  under cultivation hundreds of thousands of acres of  land. The Miami Canal, part of the system designed to  carry the flood waters from Lake Okeechobee, empties  into the Miami River a short distance above the city  and forms a waterway to the lake as well as providing  transportation for many settlers in the Everglades.  As the Tamiami Trail is built, a drainage canal is  constructed alongside and this will be made a part of a  system which will involve the expenditure of huge sums  of money, but will mean the reclamation of an empire.  Miami is the center of a remarkable agricultural  community which produced the following fruits and  vegetables as compiled by Government agents. These  figures represent the amount of products grown in Dade  County of which Miami is the county seat:  Tomatoes shipped to Northern markets 3,400 cars  Tomatoes canned in vicinity of Miami       400 cars  Total  3,800 cars  Grapefruit  .  325,000 crates  Avocadoes  ,  .     16,225     "  Limes  .  .     25,000     "  Oranges   .  .  •    .♦  .     75,000     "  Beans  ,  .     70,000     "  Eggplant .  .    39,000     "  Peppers    .  .     92,000     "  Potatoes  .  .        .        ♦  .     34,000     "  Sweet Potatoes  .    29,000     "  Ample proof has been given of the fertility of the  Everglades for fruits and vegetables, and the importance  of this land for stock-raising, both for beef and dairy  purposes, is rapidly coming to the front. On the marl  and pine prairies closer to the coast enormous quantities of citrus fruits as well as the less common tropical  varieties are grown, and these groves with the winter  vegetable gardens provide a source from which millions  of dollars are poured into the coffers of Dade County  and its county seat, Miami.  To drive through the orange, grapefruit, avocado,  mango, or other fruit groves in the middle of the winter,  or to pass fields of tomatoes, beans, cucumbers, strawberries, celery, peppers, eggplant, potatoes or pineapples  all in bearing at the same season of the year, is an experience which can never be forgotten. Following the  national policy of food conservation, none of the fruits  or vegetables are permitted to go to waste but everything is being preserved for future use in the canneries,  catsup factories, or fruit-canning plants which are be-  CENTRAL GRAMMAR  GRADE SCHOOL  SOUTHSIDE PUBLIC  SCHOOL 	Text	image/tiff						78722598 Bytes	4829	5434	3174049461	RGB	8	600	asc99990000190013001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1696	1696	1697.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1697.jp2

All these resources are concentrated  once each year at the County Fair held in Miami where  specimens of rare plants and vegetables are found side by  side with the more familiar and prosaic ones. This fair  annually astonishes, entertains and instructs thousands  of visitors who go away from it overwhelmed with conviction of the richness and productivity of this district.  DEEP WATER. The new Government Ship Channel, with 18.9 feet of water at mean low tide, and the  municipal docks and turning basin, now completed  through the combined efforts of the Government and  the City of Miami at an expense of over $1,000,000.00,  will greatly facilitate passenger travel, and commercial  traffic and marketing conditions will be greatly improved. This important work will also bring ocean  liners into Biscayne Bay and Miami will become an  important port of call because of its natural advantages  as a harbor. No South Atlantic port will have better  facilities for handling shipping in general.  MAGNIFICENT HOMES. Miami is a wealthy city  and numbers among its permanent citizens men who  are the possessors of enormous fortunes. These are  developing estates which cover large acreages and represent the expenditure of fortunes. Notable among them  is Villa Vizcaya, home of James Deering of New York  and Paris, who has decided to establish his legal residence here.     He has spent millions on his mansion  and its surroundings which occupy one of the most  beautiful sites along Biscayne Bay. His house is filled  with art treasures, for which the whole world was  searched, and the grounds contain specimens of rare  plants and trees. His brother, Charles Deering, is  likewise developing a large estate, and other multimillionaires are following their example.  Much beach property has been improved by Carl  G. Fisher, once of Indianapolis, now of Miami, and  through his influence, Miami has become the winter  home of a score or more of automobile and accessory  manufacturers, most of whom have built homes.  Writers, scientists, musicians, as well as business  men find inspiration and recreation here and a directory of the famous men and women who spend a portion of their time in Miami would consist of the cream  of Who's Who.  CITY IMPROVEMENTS. Financially the city is on  an exceptionally strong basis. Deposits in the six  banking institutions of the city on June 20, 1917, were  $8,883,395.39, which, of course, does not include any  of the large deposits kept here during the winter season  by wealthy visitors.  Close to two million dollars has been spent by the  municipality in public improvements, resulting in many  miles of streets paved with either asphalt, creosote blocks  or asphaltic oil; concrete and steel bridges; an elaborate  sanitary and storm sewer system; miles of sidewalks, as  well as the harbor improvements already mentioned,  FIRST  PRESBYTERIAN  CHURCH  FIRST  CHRISTIAN  CHURCH  'A';v;.ii  FIRST  BAPTIST  CHURCH 	Text	image/tiff						78070518 Bytes	4789	5434	909826503	RGB	8	600	asc99990000190015001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1698	1698	1699.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1699.jp2

MIAMI'S PROGRESS. The following figures as  shown by the tax assessor's report records the marvelous  growth of Miami:  1911 $ 1,656,975.00  1912  .-...'.   1,999,418.00  1913  ....   4,638,045.00  1914  6,635,837.00  1915   13,251,400.00  1916  .  A   .   .  21,000,000.00  1917  . (approximately) 24,000,000.00  INVESTMENTS. There is no doubt of Miami's future  because of the solid foundation on which the city rests.  That the climate is ideal is unquestioned; that its location as a shipping and industrial center could not be  better is acknowledged, and that its resources are  limitless is evident after only a cursory glance at the  surroundings. For these reasons investors have found  here a safe place for their money, with quick returns  and liberal profits. Both city and country real estate  have proven good in the way of investment for quick  returns; or, for one who does not care about turning the  money so quickly, a grove or farm is found to be a source  of steady, sure income after intelligent development.  SCHOOLS. As a family home, Miami is ideal. The  schools rank among the highest in the State of Florida  and in the South. Hundreds of thousands of dollars  have been spent in providing buildings and equipment,  and the standards set for the teaching corps are unusually high. The intellectual tone of the city in general is  very superior. In addition to the public schools there  is also a parochial school, several small and exclusive  private schools, a Seventh Day Adventist school and  the Pan-American College of Commerce, the latter the  first step in the great Pan-American University which  is to be ultimately established here.  PUBLIC LIBRARY. A splendid public library with  a free reading room is operated and maintained by the  Woman's Club, an organization of four hundred  members, with some assistance from the city. Lectures,  concerts and entertainments of high order are offered  frequently through the Woman's Club and other  organizations.  CHURCHES. Many beautiful churches attract the  attention of the visitor to Miami and here inspiring  sermons and beautiful music may be found in edifices  devoted to almost every creed. The denominations  represented include the Roman Catholic, Baptist,  Christian, Church of God, Church of Christ, Congregational, Episcopal, German Evangelical, Methodist  Episcopal North, Methodist Episcopal South, Swedish  Lutheran, English Lutheran, Presbyterian, Nazarene,  Seventh Day Adventist, Salvation Army, Spiritualist  and Christian Scientist.  PUBLICATIONS. Two daily papers, two weekly papers, and one monthly magazine appear regularly from  the printing presses of the city.

Civic societies flourish and are  instrumental in keeping vital questions before the people.  During the winter the sociably inclined find congenial  company in the branches of the various secret orders  which are well represented. State clubs provide much  distraction for the visitor during the winter season and  help him to feel at home.  PUBLIC UTILITIES. Public utilities include the telephone, gas, electric light and power, street car system and  an excellent water system. The city board of health keeps  rigid watch over the public health in the matter of milk and  water supply, garbage and other matters pertaining to  sanitation which properly come to its attention.  ACCOMMODATIONS. Either the visitor or the home-  seeker may find accommodations to suit his pocketbook.  Cottages and bungalows may be bought or rented &gt;  furnished or unfurnished. The former may be secured for  from $250 for the season of four to six months and up,  according to location. Larger houses may be had at proportionate rates, while, of course, the beautifully located  and furnished mansion brings a price commensurate with  the accommodations offered.  He who does not wish to assume the responsibility of  the care of a house, may easily secure apartments, furnished, for from $25 per month, for one room with kitchenette and bath, up to $250 to $750 for the season for larger  apartments with every convenience. Unfurnished houses  or apartments may be had at lower rates, but vary greatly  according to size and location.  RESTAURANTS. Within the last year, the improvement in the restaurant situation in Miami has been marked,  and never before were the city's visitors so well served in  this respect. The state hotel inspector pronounced the  eating places here, as a whole, far superior to those in other  parts of the state. A number of attractive restaurants and  cafes now cater to the public, which formerly was compelled to depend on the crowded public dining rooms  and grills of the hotels alone.  RAILROADS. Fast trains from New York, Chicago and  intermediate points, and connecting with all lines from the  West and North, bring Miami close, and make the journey  one of ease and speed. During the winter, a forty-four hour  connection with New York and similarly rapid transit  with other large centers is maintained by the Florida East  Coast Railway, which serves the city and this section of  the state. Specially equipped trains with every comfort  and luxury, and an excellent schedule, augmented in the  winter with many extra trains, are provided to care for  the crowds which all come to Miami.  Starting point for Oversea Railway service to Key West.  Boat connections to Nassau, Bahama Islands, and to  Havana, Cuba.  All roads lead to Miami. There's a reason. Come  and see.

Once just a winter resort for the wealthy, Greater Miami is  becoming a cosmopolitan center for culture, trade, transportation, while still retaining the qualities which have always made  it popular.  Greater Miami has taken on a distinctive international  flavor with nearly one-third of its population of Hispanic heritage. It has become a tourism, shopping and banking center for  the Western Hemisphere and is now attracting interest from  Europe and Asia.  The area offers a multitude of attractions and recreational  activities which take advantage of the fine year-round climate.  Sports such as golf, tennis, fishing and boating make  maximum use of the natural benefits.  Miami's geographic position in the Western Hemisphere  has opened it as a gateway for airline traffic and cruise ships  giving proof to its claim as the New World Center.  INTRODUCTION  Miami se developpe et change.  Jadis, lieu de villegiature d'hiver pour gens riches, le  Grand Miami est en train de devenir un centre cosmopolite a  caractere culturel et commercial, en meme temps qu'un noeud  de communications, tout en conservant les qualites qui I'ont  toujours rendu populaire.  Le Grand Miami a acquis un air distinctif, tres international, avec sa population qui est pour un tiers d'origine his-  panique. II est devenu un centre de tourisme, de commerce et  d'affaires, avec ses nombreuses banques, pour I'Hemisphere  Ouest et souleve maintenant I'interet de I'Europe et de TAsie.  Une multitude d'attractions et d'activites r6cr6atives y  sont offertes, qui beneficient d'un climat id6al tout au long de  I'annee. Des sports tels que le golf, le tennis, la peche, le  yachting peuvent ici tirer profit au maximum des avantages de  la nature.  La position geographique de Miami dans I'Hemisphere  Ouest, en fait une porte ouverte pour le traffic par avions et  pour les navires de croisiere, justifiant pleinement sa revendi-  cation d'etre le Centre du Nouveau Monde.  INTRODUCCION  Miami crece y esta continuamente cambiando.  En una epoca lugar preferido de temporada invemal de  las personas ricas, Miami Metropolitano se ha convertido en  centro cosmopolita de cultura, comercio, transporte y a la vez  retiene las cualidades que siempre lo hicieron tan popular y  atractivo.  Miami Metropolitano ha asumido un caractenstico sabor  internacional y casi la tercera parte de sus habitantes es de  origen hispanico. Se ha convertido en el centro de turismo,  compras y finanzas del Hemisferio Occidental y en la ac-  tualidad ha despertado el interes de Europa y Asia.  Un gran numero de atracciones y actividades recreativas  aprovechan las ventajas que brinda el acogedor clima subtropical todo ei ano. Los deportes tales como golf, tenis, pesca  y paseos en bote brindan una oportunidad de disfrutar al  maximo los beneficios de las diversiones al aire libre.  La optima ubicacion geografica de Miami en el Hemisferio Occidental le ha llevado a ser puerta de acceso para el  trafico aereo y de los barcos de cruceros lo que prueba su  reclamo de ser el Centro del Nuevo Mundo.  EINLEITUNG  Miami wachst und verandert sich.  Gross-Miami, einst nur ein Winter-Erholungsort fur die  Reichen, wird mehr und mehr zu einem kosmopolitischen  Zentrum fur Kultur, Handel und Transport, wahrend es den-  noch die Eigenschaften beibehalt, die es schon immer popular  machten.  Gross-Miami hat dadurch, dass fast ein Drittel seiner  Bevolkerung hispanischer Herkunft ist, einen besonderen, in-  ternationalen Charakter angenommen. Es ist zu einem  Tourismus-, Einkaufs- und Bankenzentrum der westlichen  Hemisphere geworden und erweckt jetzt die Aufmerksamkeit  Europas und Asiens.  Diese Gegend bietet eine Vielzahl an Attraktionen und  Freizeit-Aktivitaten, die das ganzjahrig schone Wetter nutzen.  Sportarten wie Golf, Tennis, Angeln und Boot-fahren machen  sich diese naturlichen Vorzuge ganz besonders zunutze.  Miamis geographische Lage in der westlichen Hemisphare hat diese Stadt zu einemTor fur Flugverkehr und Kreuz-  fahrtschiffe gemacht und stellt damit seinen Anspruch als  Zentrum der Neuen Welt unter Beweis. 		image/tiff						78680636 Bytes	4806	5456	1211418196	RGB	8	600	asm02500001370002001.tif		2013-08-10	2013-08-10	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/pamphlets/id/1706	1706	1707.jp2	/pamphlets/image/1707.jp2

Its location, southern latitude and proximity of the Gulf  Stream, provides mild winters and pleasant summers.  Only occasionally do winter lows drop below the 50 degrees Fahrenheit (°F)/10 degrees Celsius (°C) mark and highs  frequently are found around a comfortable 75°F/25°C. Summer evenings are warm, but balmy, and daytime temperatures  are near 85°F/30°C. Tropical and subtropical flora thrive in this  area which rarely sees below freezing temperatures.  With the City of Miami as its population and commercial  center, Greater Miami is bounded by Biscayne Bay and the  Atlantic Ocean to the east, Everglades to the west, Florida  Keys to the south and metropolitan Fort Lauderdale to the  north.  Dade County covers a land area of 2,054 square  miles/5,317.6 square kilometers with an altitude ranging from  sea level to 25 feet/7.6 meters.

Las noches veraniegas son tibias, pero con  brisa, y durante el dia las temperaturas fluctuan en los 30  grados centigrados (85F). La flora tropical y subtropical medra  en toda el area donde rara vez se sienten temperaturas de  congelacion.  Con la Ciudad de Miami como centro de su poblacion y  comercio, Miami Metropolitano linda al este con la Bahia de  Biscayne y el Oceano Atlantico, con las Cienagas de los  Everglades al oeste, con los Cayos de la Florida al sur y con  Fort Lauderdale Metropolitano al norte.

More than just a nickname, the term finds true  meaning in Miami, a city which offers a magical  brew of all the many entertaining and recreational  activities which visitors seek.  We conjured up this brochure to briefly present  to you some of the many ingredients which go  ~ into Miami's magic, the force that has  J)een   drawing   fun-seekers   to   this  enchanted land for many years.  Miami is located near the Southeast tip  of Florida. The metropolitan area known  as Greater Miami is bounded on the east by  Biscayne Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, Florida  Keys to the south, Everglades on the west and  Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood metropolitan area to  the north.  The location puts Miami near fine beaches and  excellent fishing.  Miami's location, its southern latitude and  proximity to the Gulf Stream, provides for mild  winters and pleasant summers. Winter lows  seldom dip into the 40's and afternoon  temperatures usually are in the comfortable 70's.  Summer temperatures average in the 80's.  With a subtropical marine climate, Greater  Miami has an average rainfall of 60 inches.  There are 27 cities and towns comprising the  Miami metropolitan area, including the City  of Miami which is at its government and  commercial center. Some 1.5 million  people,    representing    nearly   every  ethnic and cultural group, make the  population of metropolitan Miami.  A magic carpet is always nice to have,  but not necessary as Miami is connected to  the   nation   and   the   world   by   commercial  transportation.    Miami    is,   in   fact,   a   major  transportation and commercial center for the  Americas.  Miami   International  Airport, one of the  nation's largest and busiest, counts more  than 12 million arrivals and departures  each year. It is a connecting point for  flights to Latin America,  Europe,  Canada and most points within the  United States.  The Miami area is served by AMTRAK passenger rail service to the Northeast and Midwest.  Greyhound and Trailways interstate bus lines  connect Miami with the continental United States.  Excellent interstate highways and turnpikes  provide easy access to Miami for automobile  travelers.  The Port of Miami, largest cruise port in the  world, embarks more than a million passengers  each year for cruises to the Bahamas, Caribbean  Islands, Latin America, Europe and the Pacific. In  addition to the more than a dozen cruise ships,  the Port of Miami is an important cargo center.  Tourism is the biggest industry in the Miami  area with an estimated 13 million visitors  contributing more than 60 percent of the  economy.  Aviation and related industries are responsible  for another large segment of the economy  employing nearly 30,000. The garment industry  ranks third in the nation after New York and Los  Angeles and the area's farming and related  agribusiness account for some $75 million  annually.  We know Miami has the combination of good  things to make the best possible vacation,  convention or business trip materialize for you.

Beautiful beaches, as this one at Cape Florida,  are plentiful in Greater Miami. Miami's proximity to water  and the Gulf Stream has made it a center of water  recreation with swimming, fishing, skiing, scuba diving  and boating.  LATIN INFLUENCE. Latin American influence is very  visible in Miami's food, entertainment, fashion and  architecture. A large part of the area's population is  Spanish-speaking and "Little Havana" and "Calle Ocho"  have become as popular as other visitor attractions.  Miami is not only a place, but a time, a feeling, an  adventure, a celebration, a fiesta.  As in medieval days when the sorcerer mixed his  potions, we have taken a variety of magic ingredients  and created a golden resort. In putting these  ingredients together, we invoke the spirits of carefree  good times.  Miami is a magic land  With Orange Bowl and big brass band  Theater, art and concerts, too  A world of shops and stores for you  Sports of every style and kind  Museums to really stretch your mind  Beaches, sand and sun and surf  And horses running 'round the turf  Tropical gardens, orchids and flowers  Quiet places to spend the hours  Festivals and great trade shows  My goodness! How excitement grows  Oh, Spirits of Good Times and Fun  Take us to Miami's sun  Yes, Miami has that magical sun, sand and surf, but  the wizards of Miami have added more.  We have the world famous Orange Bowl Festival,  Miami Philharmonic, Vizcaya, "Little Havana,"  International Folk Festival, museums, colleges and  universities, concerts in the park, Planet Ocean,  Marine Stadium boat races, football and pari-mutuel  sports. More exciting things are just ahead,according  to our crystal ball.  There is a certain magic about a football game and  Miamians as well as visitors can enjoy thrilling action  whenever the Miami Dolphins and the University of  Miami Hurricanes take the field in the 75,414 seat  Orange Bowl. The stadium is the site of the annual  Orange Bowl Classic, matching two of the nation's  best collegiate teams, and has been chosen for several  Super Bowl games.  Major golf and tennis tournaments dot the Miami  calendar with plenty of courses and courts for those  who would rather play than watch.  Pari-mutuels,   wagering   sports,   are  an  around-  the calendar attraction   in   Miami.   Thoroughbreds  thunder around the tracks at Calder, Hialeah and  Gulfstream, while greyhounds scamper at Biscayne,  Flagler, Hollywood and Miami Beach dog tracks.  The "world's fastest game," jai alai, is a special treat  to Miami visitors as the sport, developed in the Basque  region of Spain, is played in only a few places in the  world including the Miami and Dania frontons.  There's not a ghost of a chance of having a dull time  in Miami during the fabulous Orange Bowl Festival  each holiday season. Three weeks of exciting activities  are highlighted by the January 1 Orange Bowl Classic  and the New Year's Eve King Orange Jamboree  Parade. The events are televised nationally and seen  by millions.  "Little Havana," an area named for its concentration  of Cuban-American owned businesses, specially Calle  Ocho (Eighth Street), features numerous Latin  American style restaurants, nightclubs and shops.  With one-third of the population of the Greater Miami  population of Latin American heritage, the area has  developed a unique flavor in its art, theater, food,  language, architecture and dress.  Miami's proximity to water has a great impact on its  recreational activities.  From racing—powered or sail—on Biscayne Bay  and at the Marine Stadium to cruises on ships  operating from the Port of Miami, boating is important  to Miami. Swimming, fishing, scuba diving and water  skiing are all popular recreational activities for Miami  visitors.  Nightclubs and theaters present the top names in  entertainment plus some of the most lavish revues  seen anywhere.  Cultural activities are enhanced by such  outstanding organizations as the Miami Philharmonic,  Miami Opera Association, Miami Ballet, International  Theater Series, Coconut Grove Playhouse, Players  Theater, Museum of Science, Historical Museum of  South Florida and many more.  Our fortune teller has looked into your future and the  outlook is perfect for any visit to Miami. Just  remember, your memories of happy times with us will  haunt you because Miami, It's Magic.

The collection is the accomplishment of two generations  of passionate collectors, the present Baron and his father  Baron Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza. The Renaissance jewels,  silver objects, gold boxes, and bbjets de vertu* on view represent a part of the collection which has remained virtually  unknown to the public until now  This is the first opportunity for Americans to see many of  these objects. Some of the most superb objects to be found in  the decorative arts are included ranging from a twelve-piece  desk set from the workshops of Carl Faberge to tureens by  Meissonier and Francois-Thomas Germain; enamelled gold  pendants from Southern Germany and Spain set with rubies  and diamonds, porcelain and gold snuffboxes, vases, tankards,  and candlesticks.

DUTCH PAINTINGS OF  THE GOLDEN AGE  From the Collection of The  National Gallery of Ireland  November 17-January 24,1988  Paulus Moreelse (1671-  1638), Portrait of a  Child, 1623.  An exhibition of important works which reflect the wide  range of subjects represented in Dutch painting of the 17th  century. The period known as the Golden Age of Dutch culture and intellectual thought flourished along with unprecedented economic and political growth. Subjects included  are: portraits, still lifes, landscapes, maritime scenes, religious  scenes and depictions of daily life. Among the artists represented are Dujardin, Ruisdael, van de Velde, Berchem and  Mytens. The exhibition has been organized by the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES) and The  National Gallery of Ireland. Local presentation has been made  possible by a generous grant from Northern Trust Bank of  Florida.  The paintings in this exhibition have been selected from the  extensive holdings of The National Gallery of Ireland, which  has approximately 200 Dutch works from this era. The collection was initiated in 1854, with the majority of works acquired  between 1870-1910.  Homan Potterton, director of The National Gallery of Ireland  stated that, "the collection of Dutch 17th and 18th century  paintings in The National Gallery of Ireland is numerically the  largest representation of any school among the Old Master  pictures in the Gallery... among this collection there are some  very important pictures by very important names... but the  strength of the collection and its character derive from the  large number of pictures of high quality by minor masters."  An exhibition catalogue will be available at the Center Art  Store for $15.  ART OF THE FANTASTIC:  LATIN AMERICA, 1920-1987  January 17~March6y 1988  Art of the Fantastic: Latin America, 1920-1987 presents works by  29 artists from three successive generations since the 1920s,  who use the fantastic as a mode of expression. Approximately  110 works by artists representing 10 countries, including  the major population centers of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia,  Venezuela and Mexico will be on view.  This exhibition examines for the first time the achievements of  20th-century artists who explore reality through the use of the  fantastic. Their seminal contributions to modern and contemporary art will be examined within the contexts of their relationship to their own cultures and those of Europe, Africa and  the United States. Artists in the exhibition include: Frida  Kahlo, Roberto Matta, Tarsila do Amaral, Rufino Tamayo and  Wifredo Lam.  "Fantastic" is a term used in literary criticism to describe an  experience in which reality is first suspended and then  confirmed on a broader level. Fantastic art is characterized  by a juxtaposition, distortion or amalgamation of images  and/or materials that extend experience by contradicting  iconographically or formally our normal expectations. Devices  such as metamorphoses, incongruous hybrids, dislocations in  time and space, and shifts in scale and materials create fantastic images that break the rules of logically ordered experience.  The exhibition was organized by the Indianapolis Museum of  Art, and is supported by major grants from the Alliance for  the Indianapolis Museum of Art, the National Endowment for  the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.  This exhibition was made possible in Miami by a generous  grant from the American Express Company. A major catalogue  is available at the Center Art Store for $30.
