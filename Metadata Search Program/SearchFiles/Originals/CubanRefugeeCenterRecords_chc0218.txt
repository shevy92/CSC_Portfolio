And this need must be met  at once if man and family are to be salvaged ... if  they are to be ultimately free. Refugees are a people  thrust abruptly from a normal existence into a rootless  and strange environment by strong and compelling  factors. Fleeing oppression, the upheaval of war, and  natural calamity, refugees have one thing in common  —a need for help and understanding.  The Cuban Refugee Program is a program to help  people. It is, at the same time, a new and challenging  experience for the United States. For the first time in  our history large numbers of refugees have arrived  directly on our shores fleeing oppression and tyranny  in their homeland. Other refugee movements to the  United States have involved third countries, special  legislation, and assistance from private voluntary  resettlement agencies. However, the Cuban exodus,  flowing into Miami, Florida, required direct Federal  participation in operations.  Prior to December 1, 1965, the arrival of Cuban  refugees in the United States was anything but controlled. Each refugee made his way to this country  the best he could . . . more often than not at great  personal risk and sacrifice. However, the present  orderly airlift of refugees from Cuba has changed that  aspect of the program. It has not eliminated the need  to assist these people.  If we could forget the origin of their present situation, and look only at the problems they face in the  United States, we would discover that the needs of  Cuban refugees are indeed similar to those of United  States citizens existing on the fringes of our society.  Perhaps the procedures and solutions we have developed may generate similar solutions for the problems  facing so many of our own countrymen.  Our success in rehabilitating refugees has been  possible only through the efforts of many. All are  helping a people in need.  Howard H. Palmatier  Director  U.S. Cuban Refugee Program  Howard H. Palmatier began working with refugees in  Europe 25 years ago. A former Foreign Service Officer of the  U. S. Department of State, he is one of few men in federal  service with long and responsible experience in refugee  affairs. His positions have taken him from Europe to the  Middle East, from the United States to South Viet Nam. He  organized HEW participation in the current airlift of refugees  from Cuba to the United States. Sensitive to the problems of  individual refugees and families, his direction of the Cuban  Refugee Program reflects the concern of Americans to help  those in need. 							41069040 Bytes	2500	5473	220208215	RGB	8	600	chc02180000810003001.tif		2013-06-11	2013-06-11	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/chc0218/id/96	96	97.jp2	/chc0218/image/97.jp2

Of course, the origins of  their respective situations differ. The incoming Cubans,  destitute because the Castro government forced them  to leave their possessions behind, are not victims of  general poverty. However, the Cubans are in a new  country, a new culture, and generally are not able to  use the English language. Yet, the successful solutions  applied to the need of Cuban refugees should not  differ greatly in many instances from those which  could materially help the needy American. As with  refugees, individuals and their families—as well as  their problems—must be identified. Information thus  compiled points the way to the tailoring of projects,  or systems of training and rehabilitation, which will  assist an American family to attain a position of self-  sufficiency. If a move to a new location is indicated—  better employment opportunities, for instance—the  family is not left on its own, helped only by receiving  a railway or bus ticket. The family must be involved  with an agency that serves both on the sending end and  the receiving end. These coordinating agencies—preferably representing the private sector—counsel intensively with the entire family, planning carefully for  the adjustment in the "resettlement" area. Since the  problems are similar to those of the Cubans, it should  follow that similar solutions will prove successful. 							40990528 Bytes	2493	5478	3743793994	RGB	8	600	chc02180000810004001.tif		2013-06-11	2013-06-11	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/chc0218/id/97	97	98.jp2	/chc0218/image/98.jp2

Yet it points up a basic cause that has  in the past, and continues today, elsewhere in the  world, to place people in a refugee status. The Vietnamese are an example.  Through no fault of their own, the Cubans and  the Vietnamese find that they must uproot themselves  from their homes due to their inability and unwillingness to live within a system of terror and persecution.  These people "vote with their feet" as they move  on to more secure ground.  Consider the pattern of assistance that can be  rendered to refugees. The first phase must be devoted  to helping them meet the necessities of hfe, i.e., food,  shelter, clothing, medical attention, and schooling for  children. The second phase must be to make it possible for the refugees to return to normal life as quickly  as possible. In every refugee situation, the key lies in  how fast a person, caught in the trauma of the homeless, can be moved into a secure normal life. This step  must be made as quickly as possible to prevent apathy  and self-pity from grabbing a death-like hold on the  individual.  Then comes the need for the normal community,  the new community in which the refugee is being  relocated, to become involved in the resettlement  process. One of the most encouraging aspects of the  Cuban airlift program is the hundreds of phone calls  which our offices receive, asking for quick onforward-  ing of refugees who arrive in Miami destined to go  to other communities. There is more involved than  the emotion of the occasion; there is the understanding  of the need for the harassed to be among relatives and  friends in a normal family situation as quickly as  possible, to prevent untold damage from being done  to the individual refugee.  A TEST OF DEMOCRACY'S STRENGTH  Refugee situations become a test of the strength of a  country in its practice of democratic principles. The  people who can make real the lessons from Matthew:  "For I was a stranger, and ye took me in" ... are  truly a strong people. And the Free World must show  its support, particularly from non-government sources. 							42006976 Bytes	2552	5484	328685295	RGB	8	600	chc02180000810005001.tif		2013-06-11	2013-06-11	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/chc0218/id/98	98	99.jp2	/chc0218/image/99.jp2

An additional number had also resettled  through other resources.  From all sides there was the feeling that the American people had successfully met the challenge posed  by the action of Castroism. Cuban communities had  developed in U.S. areas in which no Cubans resided  previously to 1959, and in others in which only a handful of people of Cuban descent dwelled. Cuban doctors  were working in hospitals and institutions, Cuban  teachers became Spanish language teachers in many  high schools and colleges, Cuban lawyers became  insurance adjusters, abstract readers, teachers, welfare  interviewers, yes — Cubans began appearing in all  walks of life throughout the nation. Less than five  percent of the resettled refugees ever required welfare  assistance and then only for short periods of time. In  Miami the public assistance caseload was reduced to  8,000 cases in October 1965, comprising less than  14,000 persons. This caseload carried the same types  of cases that require welfare assistance amongst the  Americans, i.e., over 65 years of age, medically unfit  for work, handicapped physically, and women with  young children. Within this 8,000 caseload there were  perhaps 1,500 cases which, provided the bread winner  learned rudimentary English and/ or followed a course  in vocational training, could eventually be resettled  and thus removed from the welfare rolls. Therefore,  it could be said that this splendid cooperative effort  between public and private agencies has assisted in  /&lt;,/Íj,'í&gt;.C'-^  To Freedom By Airlift  2 							42046952 Bytes	2541	5513	1797969622	RGB	8	600	chc02180000810006001.tif		2013-06-11	2013-06-11	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/chc0218/id/99	99	100.jp2	/chc0218/image/100.jp2

PRESIDENT JOHNSON HERALDS NEW PHASE  Then, on October 3, 1965, President Johnson stated  that "those who seek refuge here in America will find  it." The President directed the Department of State  to seek agreements with the government of Cuba concerning the establishment of procedures for moving  refugees from Cuba to the United States. The position  of the U.S. government was that any movement should  be orderly, consistent with our laws, and in order of  priority. The Swiss Embassy in Havana, representing  U.S. interests in Cuba, and the Cuban Foreign Ministry exchanged notes on November 6, establishing  means for the movement of Cuban refugees to the  U.S. President Johnson had stressed the fact that, for  humanitarian reasons, first priority in refugee transportation would be reserved for the reuniting of  immediate relatives. It was agreed that the priorities  would be defined as follows: parents of unmarried  children under the age of 21, spouses, unmarried  children under the age of 21, and brothers and sisters  under the age of 21. It was further agreed that the first  priority would include other close relatives living in  Cuba of persons now in the United States who reside  in the same household as the immediate relatives,  when such inclusion was required by humanitarian  considerations.

He  stated further: "As a result of the Cuban Refugee  Program launched in 1961, more than 180,000 refugees have been aided to resettle and integrate in Miami  and elsewhere in the United States. This is a good  record of which Americans can be proud. I want our  new program to be even better."  AIRLIFT STARTS DECEMBER 1, 1965  As the result of President Johnson's statement of October 3, 1965, and the subsequent agreement worked out  with the Cuban government, refugees began entering  the United States from Cuba on December 1. Two  planeloads per day, five days per week, has been the  rate of arrivals. As of December 31, 1969, 175,901  refugees had arrived by airlift.  The Memorandum of Understanding between the  two governments calls for an exchange of lists. The  American lists, called U.S. Master Lists, name those  persons in Cuba claimed by relatives here whom the  United States considers eligible for entry within the  terms of the Memorandum. The Cuban lists—called  Cuban Master Lists — are compiled by the Cuban  government and name those persons considered  eligible for exit permits by that government. Those  names which appear on both lists form the basis for  what are called Joint Consolidated Lists—lists of persons both governments consider eligible for movement  under the terms of the agreement.  Forms submitted to the Cuban Refugee Center by  persons in the United States wishing to bring relatives  here from Cuba serve, in part, as the basis for compilation of our lists. This is a simple one-page form  which gives the name and address of the U.S. claimant,  and the name, date and place of birth, address, and  relationship of the persons in Cuba being claimed.  All this information is placed on data-processing cards  and is used by this and other federal agencies, not  only for compiling our lists but for other internal  processing requirements.  TEMPORARY DELAYS POSSIBLE  Before the final embarkation list for a specific flight  is made up, a number of things can happen which  might result in deletion of a name from the Joint  Consolidated List or cause a temporary delay in  departure from Cuba. The Cuban government may  decide at the last moment to deny permission to exit.  Also, new information of a security nature might  result in a last minute turndown by American authorities. Simple errors in spelling of a name, or other  mistakes in identification, may occur at the last  moment and delay or cancel departure. Every effort  is made to overcome the possibility of these last  moment disappointments.

The federal government  assured the community that the Cuban refugee problem is viewed as a national problem. Every effort is  being made, through the good offices of the four  Voluntary Agencies working with the federal government, to resettle the incoming refugee to a community  other than Miami. This resettlement program, as in  the past, assists greatly in relieving Miami of bearing  the brunt of the refugee impact. While we must admit  that it is difficult to counsel a person whose claimant  is living in Miami to move off to another community,  there is no intention on the part of the government  to introduce any element of "forced relocation." This  would not be in the American tradition. When an  incoming refugee, joining Miami relatives, requires  welfare assistance on an emergency-compassionate  basis, his Voluntary Agency points out the employment  possibilities and assistances which exist in other areas.  Cuban Refugee Program offices, both in Washington  and in Miami, have been overwhelmed by the rate in  which job offers come in. The fact that we are in the  midst of a booming economy can best be illustrated by  the letters, the visits, the telephone calls we receive  about job openings.

Will the government  move them quickly and not subject them to days of  questioning? Can our parents join us in this city where  our foster parents live, right away? We are happy to  report that there is little delay due to governmental  red tape in the processing. We recognize the psychological value of moving a person on to his father, his  mother, his children and into a normal situation as  quickly as it is possible, and feasible, with the recognition that there may be instances in which a visit  with relatives in Miami, not the claimant, may be of  psychological advantage.  We have been pleased to note the encouraging  actions which have been taking place around the  country through newly developed Cuban nationality  groups. For example, a key group has been established  in Miami. This is the Cuban Sertoma Club which is  linked up nationally with other Sertoma clubs. Their  approach is non-political and one of service to their  fellow nationals. We are not, as we were during the  early days of the program, without strong Cuban  communities to call upon for assistance.  Still another development which has strengthened  our work might be dealt with in two parts. Soon after  the initial announcement on the new influx of Cubans,  President Johnson named an Interdepartmental Task  Force, under the chairmanship of HEW Secretary  Gardner, to seek ways in which the federal government might initiate programs, in cooperation with  local agencies, designed to meet some of the community problems in Miami/Dade County. The success of such efforts has been helpful.  Many times in this Program we have faced the  problem created by the necessity to establish training  programs and similar projects to help Cubans prepare  themselves for gainful employment in this country.  We were handicapped by the fear of doing more for  Cuban refugees than was being done for Americans  in need.  The possible impact of additional refugees in  Miami brought that community to the point of seeing  the need for increased federal assistance in establishing projects to service the Negroes, the Puerto Ricans  and the "welfare whites". The Dade County Community Task Force, working in conjunction with the  Washington Task Force, has helped the Miami/Dade  County area to alleviate the crush of poverty.  As of December 31, 1969, the number of cases of  Cuban refugees receiving public assistance in Miami  was 14,205. That is a far cry from the peak load of  over 21,281 cases. Of the current cases which involve  medical problems, a large proportion is comprised of  persons over 65.

One of our most difficult groups was the single  unaccompanied women (many of the latter with small  children) who did not have the training to become  employed. In one year, through our training programs, the motivation on the part of the women and  the generous aid of the Resettlement Agencies, we  were able to reduce this group.  The Resettlement Agencies, pressed as they are by  the continuing influx, are not overlooking the cases of  persons who arrived several years ago. Each has  reviewed the earlier cases, as the result of which many  of the refugees have been revitalized through effective  counseling and resettled to a new life.  RATE OF RESETTLEMENT HIGH  As of December 31, 1969, 175,901 refugees have  arrived in Miami by the airlift that started December  1, 1965. Of this number 125,277 refugees have been  resettled. Since registration at the Miami Center is voluntary, not all of the refugees destined to join relatives  in Miami are registered. On an overall basis our figures show that each week we are consistently moving  out of Miami,over the resettlement route, nearly as  many refugees as the number who register with the  Center. From the start of the airlift December 1, 1965,  on through the year 1969, refugees registered numbered 173,288. Refugees resettled in that period numbered 141,291, or 82 percent of those registered.

These  refugees went to almost 3,000 cities throughout the  United States, a remarkable distribution. With _the  United States economy booming, with Cuban and  other community groups showing such good will, we  know this current influx of Cuban refugees is one of  the smoothest movements of a refugee group in modern days.  One word about American repatriates. There is a  repatriation program, funded through authorization  from Congress, first in 1961 and renewed each year  thereafter. Many of the families coming out contain  Americans who are not the head of the family. In cases  in which the head of the family is a Cuban national,  the responsibility for the processing and handling of  the case rests with the Cuban Refugee Program. In  these cases the Voluntary Agencies are concerned just  as they are with the normal refugee cases entering via  the airlift. In cases in which the head of the family is  an American, the responsibility for assistance rests  with the Repatriate Office of HEW, which works  through state welfare offices. As the Cuban government has permitted, more than 686 Americans have  taken advantage of this means of escape from Cuba.  WELFARE CASES IN RESETTLEMENT LOW  One measurement of success in adjustment of the  Cuban refugee in the United States is the low number  of cases needing welfare assistance after resettlement.  Resettlement Agency representatives are urged to  encourage constituents to do everything possible to  help the refugee in the initial stage of resettlement.  Encouraging to refugees who aspire to full use of  their talents, and also to communities seeking to have  them participate more fully in the freedom to which  they have fled, is the 1966 law that eases steps necessary for them to become permanent residents. Thousands have applied to the Immigration and Naturalization Service for change-of-status from parolee (temporary guest) to resident, from which point they can  advance toward citizenship. Particularly in the professions and top trades these steps can move refugees  to higher service and greater income.  THE EARLIER YEARS OF THE PROGRAM  A glance backward to a "record of which Americans  can be proud" is needed to round out this review.  In February, 1961, President Kennedy charged  the Honorable Abraham Ribicoff, then Secretary of  Health, Education, and Welfare, with the responsibility of establishing a program to carry out a nine-  point outline advanced by the President to assist in  meeting the needs of the Cuban refugees who were  coming into this country at the rate of 1,800 per week. 							41139488 Bytes	2492	5500	651176986	RGB	8	600	chc02180000810012001.tif		2013-06-11	2013-06-11	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/chc0218/id/105	105	106.jp2	/chc0218/image/106.jp2
Page 13																											chc0218000081	chc02180000810013001		In this emergency situation, the Department of  Health, Education, and Welfare naturally turned to  existing public and voluntary agencies to carry out  various aspects of the refugee program. In fact, several  voluntary agencies were already active in Miami.  On the federal side, the Department called upon  several of its own units: the Children's Bureau, in  connection with Cuban children who were arriving  without parents or relatives; the Public Health Service,  for formulation of a program of medical services; the  Bureau of Family Services, with respect to financial  assistance; and the Office of Education, in relation to  the education of both children and adults. Also, it  turned to the Department of Labor for aid in job  placement of refugees in other localities; and to the  Department of Agriculture for surplus commodities.  STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES INVOLVED  In Florida, at the State and local level, the involvement of a number of public agencies was sought: The  Florida Department of Public Welfare, the Dade  County Board of Public Instruction, and the Dade  County Health Department.  Four national Voluntary Agencies agreed to carry  out the resettlement program, under contract with  the federal government. They were: Catholic Relief  Services, of the National Catholic Welfare Conference, now known as U.S. Catholic Conference;  Church World Service, of the National Council of  Churches, a Protestant organization; the Hebrew  Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS), which has been  concerned with the relatively small number of Jewish  persons among the refugees; and, the non-sectarian  International Rescue Committee.

It has been estimated that as many as 40 to 50  persons may be involved in arranging for the resettlement of a single refugee. Most of these are volunteers  —American citizens in a local community who are  concerned about the plight of the Cubans.  Miami, for the arriving refugee, was an area of  beauty, palm trees, tropical plants and a climate much  like that of his homeland. He found vacant housing  available. From the viewpoint of Miami landlords,  the coming of the refugees was a highly fortunate  circumstance. They found tenants for houses and  apartments that some landlords had given up hope  of renting.  These were the plus factors in the refugee movement. The minus factors were much more important.  Few job opportunities existed in Miami in relation to  the number of applicants. Even refugees fortunate  enough to find jobs were usually unable to put their  best skills to use. An engineer working as a dishwasher  and a veterinarian working as a parking lot attendant  have been typical examples.  PUBLIC ASSISTANCE THEN A NECESSITY  This lack of jobs made public assistance a necessity.  This assistance, financed entirely by the federal government and administered by the Florida Department  of Public Welfare by special agreement, is provided  on the basis of the same standards of need applied to  other residents of Florida. The maximum amount  which needy refugees may receive is $100 a month for  a family and $60 a month for a needy single person  who is not part of a family.

Among the more than 600,000 Cubans who have come to the United States to escape the Castro regime in Cuba are an elite minority.  Possessing unusual  talents, ambition and drive, the elite have repeated the rags to riches pattern of many earlier immigrants.  The largest group of refugees, however, like the majority of U. S. citizens, lead less dramatic lives.  As members of various professions and trades,  as parents, and as active participants in community life, they are now a part  of the mainstream of U.S. society.  Even though they arrived without resources  and could speak little or no English, these handicaps proved merely temporary  deterrents which were readily offset by the services provided through the  Cuban Refugee Program.  Organized in 1961 as a unit of the U.S. Department of  Health, Education, and Welfare, this program has mobilized public and voluntary resources to meet emergency refugee financial needs, to provide English  training, and to help them resettle in communities throughout the country.  Their rapid adjustment to our society is a clear demonstration that, given the  normal attributes of relatively good health, education and habits of industri-  ousness, strangers can attain economic security in the United States today  with a minimum of special help.  As in our society, however, the Cuban refugee population includes another  group, relatively small, but one that presents an impressive array of social  and economic problems.  This group is similar to that group of U.S. citizens  served by the Aid to Families with Dependent Children Program.  In this Cuban  group all the complexities of the problem of hard core poverty are reduced to  a scale which facilitates study and comprehension.  This report concerns this study; the results of the project which derived  from it and which have been successful in virtually eliminating the problem of  hard core poverty among the individuals of this group.  It depicts the initiative and ingenuity employed to meet the problems.  It presents the flexibilities which are required to remove obstacles -- both real and imagined -- which  might prevent the timid from moving toward their objectives.  Community leaders, welfare officials, and employment specialists will find in it ideas and  encouragement for meeting similar problems within their own communities.  We believe the issuance of the report is particularly timely because many  of the features within the project are similar to those which will be required  to carry out the provisions of the 1967 public welfare amendments to the Social  Security Act as they relate to the Aid to Families with Dependent Children  Program.  -Howard H, Palmatier, Director  Cuban Refugee Program  "NOTE -- Howard H.

Page 4																											chc0218000079	chc02180000790004001		HOW THE STUDY STARTED  During 1961 and 1962, a steady  stream of Cuban refugees arrived in  Miami by air and by boat.  Since the  United States was a country of "first  asylum", they had no sponsors, no  plans for the future; they had quite  literally fled to freedom with only  the few belongings which they could  carry with them.  To cope with the situation, the  Cuban Refugee Program was organized  within the U.S. Department of Health,  Education, and Welfare.  The Program  established a Refugee Center in Miami  where all refugees who needed any type  of service could register  (about  274,000 had done so by early 1968)  and, through arrangements with Miami,  Dade County, and the State of Florida,  met the refugees! immediate needs for  financial assistance and for health,  education, and welfare services.  Simultaneously, through contracts given  by the Program to the four major national voluntary refugee agencies,  National Catholic Welfare Conference  (now U.S. Catholic Conference), Church  World Service,United HIAS Service, and  International Rescue Committee, plans  went forward to resettle in other  parts of the country as many refugees  as possible as quickly as possible.  In these busy years, there was  little time for concern about the relatively few refugees who were unable  to re-establish themselves rapidly, in  Miami or elsewhere, through this  smooth and efficient operation.  The  few who could not adjust lived in  Miami slums, eking out an existence on  their Federal public assistance checks  (a maximum of $100 per month per family, $60 single person), while interest and activity centered upon the  much more numerous group of Cubans who  were moving on to new lives of independence and freedom.  Then, in late 1962, the stream of  refugees dwindled to a trickle.  As a  result of the missile crisis of that  year, Castro cancelled all commercial  flights.  Instead of daily planeloads  of refugees, (almost 2,000 persons a  week) there were only the occasional  arrivals of intrepid Cubans who managed to escape in small boats.  Considering the speed with which most  Cuban refugees had become established  in this country, it seemed reasonable  to expect that the sharp decrease in  new arrivals would soon mean that the  Cuban Refugee Program could be abolished.  But something was wrong with  these calculations.  The Cubans who  remained dependent upon public assistance were not moving toward independence as fast as past records indicated  they should be.  Could it be that this  residue group was somehow different  from the average refugee?  No longer pre-occupied with hundreds of new arrivals each day, the  staff of the Cuban Refugee Program  were asked by the then recently appointed Director of the Cuban Refugee  Program, John F. Thomas, to concentrate on seeking the answer to that  question.  Use of Data Processing Equipment  At that time some 22,000 public  assistance checks were going out  monthly to Cuban refugees in the Miami  area.  There was a rudimentary record  on each individual or family who received such aid and their need for aid  was reinvestigated periodically.  But  this case-by-case approach, while it  assured that funds were not being  misspent, presented no real picture of  what the total caseload was like.  How  much of the dependency could be accounted for by old age, by chronic  disability, by lack of initiative in  seeking employment? Was there one  basic problem or many?  To get a quick, general picture  of the total caseload, electronic data  processing equipment was installed in  the Refugee Center at Miami and caseworkers , during personal interviews  with each recipient of assistance, obtained material relating to self-  support potential which could readily 							92857316 Bytes	4823	6416	1186246500	RGB	8	600	chc02180000790004001.tif		2013-06-11	2013-06-11	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/chc0218/id/116	116	117.jp2	/chc0218/image/117.jp2
Page 5																											chc0218000079	chc02180000790005001		be coded and put onto punch cards.  By  use of the electronic equipment, the  total time, from the start of the interviews and the setting up and organizing of the data processing system to  the compilation of the data, took just  nine months.  Instead of a mass of  dormant information, recorded but inaccessible for effective use, the  Program staff now had a full picture  of the scope and nature of the problems that confronted them.  What the Review Revealed  Through this review, the staff  learned that, in general, the caseload  contained four types of people - one  group which could be expected to resettle soon (relatively new arrivals  with no handicaps); one which had  handicaps but could become employable  if trained in new skills; a third  which had handicaps that would require  remedial treatment; and a fourth group  made up of women with small children  and of elderly individuals who seemed  to have very little employment potential.  The regular operation of the Program could meet the needs of the first  three groups. All that was needed was  to speed up and intensify the use of  existing resources.  Only the fourth  group presented problems with which  the Program was not prepared to cope.  Since the majority (3,800 cases) in  that group were women with small children who had little or no education or  work skills, it was obvious that major  attention must be given to their problems if chronic dependency was to be  prevented.  (A program for the older  men and women in this fourth group is  also included in the "Training for  Independence" project but is not covered in this report since it represents a minor and separate aspect of  the total project).  Individual Evaluations  Each of the 3,800 women were  therefore interviewed by employees  most qualified by their experience in  counselling and orientation and their  ability to draw pertinent information  from the refugee through depth-  interviewing techniques.  It was during these evaluative  interviews that the similarity between  this Cuban group and the American  mothers served by the Aid to Families  with Dependent Children program became  most apparent.  Like many AFDC mothers, few of these Cuban women could  realistically expect the fathers of  their children to support the family.  They were either unmarried or had marital problems which made it unlikely  that, regardless of the political situation in Cuba, they would ever be reunited with, or obtain support from,  the fathers of their children.  Their reactions to their situation were similar to those found among  AFDC mothers. Many were unable to  face reality and, while unhappy in  their ghetto slum, had only vague and  improbable dreams of how their lives  might ultimately change for the better.  In common with other poverty groups,  they were present-oriented.  Suggestions for actions now that would reap  rewards later had power to motivate  only a few. Many showed a complete  lack of confidence in themselves.  They felt they would "never" be able  to learn English or master a skill.  Most felt threatened by any suggestion  of changes which might jeopardize the  meager security of their public assistance check.  Giving as reasons  their own poor health and/or their  children's needs, many felt that they  were entitled to receive financial  assistance indefinitely, and their interests and energies were concentrated  more upon efforts to get higher grants  or better treatment than upon efforts  to become self-supporting.  In designing the "Training for  Independence" project, three predominant problems were given major  consideration: the mothers1 lack of  motivation which, whether it stemmed  from fear of failure, fear of any  change in the status quo, apathy or 							93842392 Bytes	4850	6448	2709879809	RGB	8	600	chc02180000790005001.tif		2013-06-11	2013-06-11	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/chc0218/id/117	117	118.jp2	/chc0218/image/118.jp2
Page 6																											chc0218000079	chc02180000790006001		other causes, was the most serious  factor; child care problems; and  health problems.  At the outset of the project, the  motivation problem was handled negatively: mothers must sign up for the  project or they would cease to be eligible for public assistance and all  other benefits of the Cuban Refugee  Program. More positive approaches are  now being added,however, as staff of  the Cuban Child Welfare Center has  been able to work with the mothers  more intensively.  Child care and  health problems were handled positively from the start.  Licensed day care  facilities were available to any mother who could not make her own arrangements for the care of their children  and medical care was available to all  mothers and children who required it.  DESIGN AND OPERATION OF PROJECT  "TRAINING FOR INDEPENDENCE"  The actual training of the women  to equip them for employment consists  of two parts:  English instruction and  vocational training. Women who already have a working knowledge of  English are enrolled immediately in  the vocational phase, but the majority  begin with English classes, which they  attend for 2% hours, five days a week,  for eight or nine months.  They then  begin vocational courses which they  attend for 3 to 6 hours daily over a  period of 6 to 8 weeks, the variations  depending upon the type of training  taken and individual variations in  speed of achieving proficiency.  The project is designed to give  every woman a rudimentary knowledge of  English and a marketable skill within  a year.  However, from the outset,  flexibility has been stressed.  If a  woman needs more time to master either  English or skill, this is arranged.  Although use is made of the regular vocational training school maintained by the Dade County Board of  Public Instruction for certain special  courses, most of the vocational train  ing as well as the English classes are  given at the "English Center", an  abandoned high school building renovated and rented by the Cuban Refugee  Program. Classes are operated on a  shift basis so that, while most mothers spend three hours or less at the  Center each day, the bi-lingual instructors work a full 8-hour day.  By "Hear It, Say It" Method,  Working Knowledge Of English  Is Quickly Attained.  Upon completion of the full  training period, graduation ceremonies  are held at which each woman receives  a wallet-sized card which she can present to prospective employers, showing  that she has successfully completed  her training.  Both the English and the vocational courses have been carefully designed to meet the special needs of  the Cuban refugee.  The English classes use an adaptation of the "hear it-  say it" technique developed by the  English Language Institute of the  University of Michigan.  This method  concentrates on ear perception and  voice reproduction instead of the traditional methods in which emphasis is  placed on reading and writing.  The  method gives the refugee, in a rela- 							93064024 Bytes	4809	6449	2976924907	RGB	8	600	chc02180000790006001.tif		2013-06-11	2013-06-11	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/chc0218/id/118	118	119.jp2	/chc0218/image/119.jp2

Vocational Training offered at the  English Center covers basic and special  industrial power sewing machine operation; clerical courses: typing, filing,  bookkeeping, general office practice,  etc.; child care, and upholstery.  The facilities of the regular  community training school (the Lindsey-  Hopkins Vocational Training Center), is  also operated by the Dade County Board  of Public Instruction, and are used for  the hotel course.  This training facility runs an actual hotel which accommodates about 200 guests and can train  Cuban mothers in various types of hotel  work.  In addition, training at the vocational school is arranged on an individual basis for trainees whose  background or experience indicates  Proud Of Achievement, Cuban Mothers  Display Certificates Of Graduation.

As in the  English Center, bi-lingual instructors , paid for by the Cuban Refugee  Program, teach the courses at the vocational school.  Although the woman's preference  and her educational and work background are given due consideration in  assignments for vocational training,  the majority of enrollees are assigned  for training as power sewing machine  operators.  There are several reasons  for the extensive use of this training:  Most Cuban women of all classes have  been trained from childhood to do  skillful sewing and, through this handwork, have an innate understanding of  the purposes and value of the power machine; the work calls for very little  use or knowledge of English; and there  is a heavy demand for garment workers  in the Miami area.  In fact, largely  as a result of the influx of Cubans,  Miami is rapidly becoming one of the  major garment manufacturing centers of  the nation.  Thus, although the women  must agree to accept resettlement in  any part of the country in order to be  eligible to enroll in the project,  there is a very good chance that, by  becoming a sewing machine operator,  they can attain independence without  still another move to another strange  community - an important consideration  for these insecure mothers. 							93585800 Bytes	4833	6453	3961507742	RGB	8	600	chc02180000790007001.tif		2013-06-11	2013-06-11	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/chc0218/id/119	119	120.jp2	/chc0218/image/120.jp2
Page 8																											chc0218000079	chc02180000790008001		(Among many problems wrestled  with in developing Training for Independence was a workable plan for paying transportation costs for trainees  between home and the English Center.  As in other problems, there was no  precedent.  Small change handling between training project officials and  trainees was out of the question.  Someone suggested a token system involving the public bus operators.  The  operators said no.  Other possibilities were discussed and abandoned.  Finally, with painstaking steps toward  untried procedures a plan was approved  -- really simple, but bafflingly new.1  Each month a $9 check was issued each  trainee by the headquarters of the  state-administered project -- if her  attendance report justified it.  This  covered the expenses of travel so  trainees did not have to dip into  their financial assistance income.  Progress toward other new needs came,  as it does in all pioneering, and problems were overcome*)  Distinguishing Features Of the Project  Aside from its including English  classes, one might conclude from the  above description of its training aspects that project "Training for Independence" is essentially the same as  the many work experience and training  projects conducted by public welfare  agencies with funds authorized by  Title V of the Economic Opportunity  Act.  In actual operation, however,  there are a number of differences, notably, its compulsory nature, its exceptional day care program, and its  extensive use of community resources.  COMPULSORY PARTICIPATION  One of the most significant differences is the compulsory nature of  the project.  As each woman is interviewed and the project explained to  her, she is informed that if she  wishes to continue to receive the financial and other benefits of the  Cuban Refugee Program, she must sign  a statement agreeing to take the  training and to accept resettlement  in another part of the country after  she completes the training if this  proves necessary in order for her to  obtain employment.  Although these conditions are  presented in terms of giving the mother an opportunity to improve life for  herself and her children and although  postponements and exemptions are made  whenever a mother presents valid reasons for not enrolling, the element of  coercion has been recognized and resented by many of the women.  Of the 3,800 women who were asked  to enroll at the time the project was  launched, in July 1964, about 25 percent refused to do so. A follow-up  survey of those who refused indicated  that the majority had part time jobs.  Others had been spurred by the proposal to seek and obtain jobs.  Among the remaining group who had  no alternative to enrollment, those  who welcomed it as an opportunity were  probably a minority. Had the proposal  been handled less skillfully, there  might well have been open rebellion.  However, because it was presented on  an individual basis by sympathetic interviewers, no crisis situation arose.  The only special publicity given to  the project when it was launched was a  press release which stressed the opportunity more than the compulsory aspects. What criticism did occur in  the press - and this was also a major  concern of the women - was related to  the requirement that the women must  agree to resettle if necessary.  The  Cuban paper has always opposed resettlement and the American press questioned a requirement that might  diminish a labor source which the area  had come to depend upon.  Preparatory Sessions  To further ease tensions, all the  mothers in the initial group were  brought together for a meeting shortly  before the classes started.  This  meeting was held in the Miami office 							93860804 Bytes	4860	6436	494250679	RGB	8	600	chc02180000790008001.tif		2013-06-11	2013-06-11	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/chc0218/id/120	120	121.jp2	/chc0218/image/121.jp2

CUBAN REFUGEE CENTER  Freedom Tower  Miami, Florida  NEWS RELEASE: Sunday,  June 28, 1964  1TRAINING FOR INDEPENDENCE  PROJECT INTERVIEWS START  FOR CUBAN REFUGEE WOMEN  A self-help plan for Cuban refugee women who have no means of support except through public assistance funds of the Cuban Refugee Program was made  known today by John F. Thomas, Director of the Cuban Refugee Program,  Washington, D.C.  Two steps are included in this "Training For Independence" project.  The  first is intensive training in English, in preparation for learning and earning in a special skill.  The second is enrollment in vocational courses to  prepare women for jobs that can be made available to them in various parts of  the country.  Both the English and vocational classes will be carried on in an  arrangement with the Dade County Board of Public Instruction, funds provided  through the Cuban Refugee Program.  Several hundred women have been invited to interviews at the Refugee Center this week to inform them of details of the project.  The special English  classes, in addition to those regularly carried on for Cubans, are scheduled  to start July 20 and to continue three months.  They will be at the English  Center, 235 N.W. 3 Ave.  Vocational courses for hand sewing, sewing machine work, office machine  operation, clerical assistants, nursing aides, domestic service in hotels and  motels, silk screening art work, and other duties, will be scheduled later in  the year.  The objective is to help refugee women help themselves to become  eligible for job opportunities available through the resettlement agencies  that are coordinated by the federal government at the Center.  The Center's message to the women being interviewed is that "we are interested in helping you to become self-supporting... if you feel that you do  not wish to take these courses we will have to assume that you are no longer  interested in the basic benefit of this program, which is resettlement to job  opportunities, and therefore, other benefits of the program will not be available to you".

A  staff member then again explained the  project plan.  The third speaker was a  Cuban mother who had taken training at  the Vocational Training School prior  to the opening of the project and had  found employment.  The final speaker  was a caseworker who discussed the  fears and worries which she knew were  troubling many of the women.  Following this formal part of the  meeting, the mothers were interviewed  individually by the case-workers, each  caseworker interviewing five mothers.  At this time, appointments were made  for the mother and her children to  visit the foster home or day care center where the children were to be  cared for while the mother was in  class. Coffee was served to the mothers while they were waiting for their  individual interviews.  Throughout  both the formal and the interview sessions, the children were cared for in  a play group in another room so that  the mothers could give their full attention to the program.  (After the initial enrollment,  the plan for this introductory session  was modified.  Instead of the large  meeting, the mothers were brought together in groups of ten, and two caseworkers , each of whom would carry five  of the cases permanently, carried on a  discussion type meeting.  This gave  the mothers more opportunity to raise  questions and express their fears and  doubts and was found to be more satisfactory.)  The Mothers' Reactions  ,fWe were as mad as wet hens" one  mother told a newspaper reporter who  came to the first graduating class of  power sewing machine operators, which  occurred three months after the launching of the project.  ITWe complained all  the first day and every night for a  week.  Then we found we were having a  good time. Now we are sorry it is over;  we have learned so much and made new  friends".  This proved to be such a common  reaction that a number of caseworkers  who had initially regarded the mandatory provisions as a regressive measure are re-evaluating their concepts.  Deeply sunk in inertia and apathy, entrenched in patterns of frustration  and hopelessness, many of these mothers could not have responded to a  merely persuasive proposal for embarking upon a new way of life. Once  change was forced upon them, however,  they liked it, learned readily, and  have gone on to employment (80 percent  of the enrollees in the first classes  obtained steady employment immediately  upon completion of their training).  Today, with the more interesting lives  they lead and the higher living standards they now enjoy, there are no regrets.  Motivation Problem Continues  Simply requiring the mothers to  enroll in the project, however, did not  solve the motivation problem for all of  them.  Some of the most disadvantaged  mothers, while they went through the motions of participation had no real commitment or desire to succeed.  They were frequently absent from classes and were  inattentive even when present.  The Chronically Dependent  Illustrative of the problems  these mothers presented is the case of  Mrs. H.  Unlike the women who were  vocal in their complaints, Mrs. H, was  as docile in accepting the training  requirement as she had been in agreeing to leave Cuba with a man who then  promptly deserted her and in accepting  the attentions of other men who had no  real interest in her or in the children  they fathered by her.  When the project was launched,  Mrs. H. was 30 years old and had four  children, all under ten years of age. 							93561888 Bytes	4840	6442	761549542	RGB	8	600	chc02180000790010001.tif		2013-06-11	2013-06-11	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/chc0218/id/122	122	123.jp2	/chc0218/image/123.jp2

An obese,  slatternly-looking woman, with only  two years of formal education, it would  have been difficult to enable her to  become employable even if she had been  genuinely interested in achieving independence.  And Mrs. H was far from interested in the slow and arduous process of  gaining independence by a dint of  learning English and a trade.  Although arrangements had been made for  the care of the two pre-school children while she attended classes,  Mrs. H was frequently absent, usually  giving health problems as the reason.  She had a variety of aches, pains and  nervous troubles, yet visits to the  clinic revealed no organic causes.  At one point, she tried to "buy"  her way out of the project by getting  her landlord to give her the room  rent-free in exchange for her scrubbing the hallways of the rooming  house.  In another mood of despair,  she wrote to the President of the  United States requesting that he send  her an automobile as a present, explaining that it was only the lack of  a car that prevented her from earning  a living for her children. When questioned by her caseworker, to whom the  letter was ultimately referred, Mrs. H  admitted that she did not know how to  drive a car and had no plan for using  it, but she still felt that if the  President would give her one, all her  problems would somehow be solved.  Gradually, with a great deal of  supportive service from her caseworker,  Mrs. H. did attend English classes  sufficiently to gain a rudimentary  knowledge of the language and went on  to a course in laundry work at the vocational training school.  However,  whenever she was given an appointment  to apply for a job, illness or some  other reason always prevented her from  doing so.  Finally, the caseworker decided to take matters into his own  hands.  When the next job opportunity  arose, he went to Mrs. H's home, overrode her excuses, and escorted her to  the prospective employer. Not only  was Mrs. H. hired, but a few months  later the agency received a letter  from the employer expressing great  satisfaction with Mrs. H's work and  asking if any other workers of her  caliber were available!  Indirect Values  In another problem case, the C's,  the project not only rehabilitated the  mother but also, indirectly, the father of her children.  Although Mr. C  was married to another woman, he had  lived with Mrs. C in Cuba and was instrumental in bringing her and their  two children, then aged 7 and 3 years,  to the United States in 1961.  He did  not share a home with them here however and gave them very little support  as he was in poor health and dependent  on odd jobs.  Public assistance had  been the main source of income for  Mrs. C and her children for almost  four years by the time the "Training  for Independence" project was launched.  Mrs. C. was asked to join the first  classes, but received a postponement  because she was again pregnant.  She  was given continuing casework services  however and, in 1965 began training in  English and later, in the power sewing  machine course. Mrs. C's case record  is filled with her complaints about  the inadequacy of her public assistance  grant,  her health, her landlords (she  was constantly moving from one slum  room to another).  Despite her absorption in her troubles, however, Mrs. C  made a good record in her training  course and obtained work at a good  salary.  Once on a job, she became  less self-absorbed and her health and  landlord problems diminished accordingly. Her more hopeful and outgoing  attitude was apparently infectious for  Mr. C. too began to improve in health  and, shortly after Mrs. C. went to  work, he too obtained steady employment.  Subsequently, he divorced his  wife (they had no children), married  Mrs. C. and, with both working regu- 							93387856 Bytes	4822	6454	1702730263	RGB	8	600	chc02180000790011001.tif		2013-06-11	2013-06-11	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/chc0218/id/123	123	124.jp2	/chc0218/image/124.jp2

Analysis of Motivations  With growing experience in dealing with the problem of motivating the  very deprived mothers who have never  known the discipline of either school  or work life, the staff of the Cuban  Child Welfare Center has refined their  approached.  The mother's interests  are carefully analyzed from the time  she enrolls in the program and encouragement and support is based upon appeals to her real interests.  Generally, it has been found, the mothers  can be classified into three types.  The majority have a very genuine interest in the welfare of their children and can be appealed to on the  grounds that, not only will they be  able to give the children more of the  things they want and need, but that  the children will have greater respect for them if they are independent  and have broader interests.  A second  group of women, however, are in reality resentful of their children.  They  did not want to have them and they  feel burdened by them.  To these more  self-centered women, appeals are based  upon the gains they themselves will  realize - enough money to buy pretty  clothes, opportunities to meet new  friends&gt; a freer and more interesting  life.  To a third group, men are the  all important factors in their lives  and efforts to motivate must be related to this.  Some see no point in  doing anything until their husbands  can come from Cuba and look after them.  To these, it is pointed out that during  the husband's period of adjustment, he  will find it hard to carry the full  burden of support and that she can  serve him best by sharing that burden.  Other mothers in this group have no  husbands.  To them it is pointed out  that a man is more likely to become  interested if he knows he will not have  to carry the full burden of supporting  children who are not his own.  Early attention to any signs of  flagging interest has also been found  to be highly important.  Whenever a  mother is absent from class for two  successive days, she is visited by  her caseworker.  Cards, enclosed with the monthly  public assistance checks, are also  used to build up interest.  These frequently tell about, or carry direct  messages from, women who have completed their training and are earning  a good living.  Longer stories,  with  pictures of women working and of children in the day care program, are  often used in Program periodicals,  RE-CAP, which is issued in English and  OPORTUNIDADES issued in Spanish.  The  Spanish publication OPORTUNIDADES is  widely circulated among refugees and  has proved to be a very effective  morale builder for all phases of the  Cuban Refugee Program.  ADEQUATE DAY CARE SERVICES  Although work Experience and  Training projects for AFDC mothers  have always been set up to include  day care for the children while the  mothers are in training, very few of  these projects have given such careful attention to this problem as has  been given to it in the "Training for  Independence" project.  j  m&m^-^Ñ   Day Care Scene, While Mothers  Attend Training Classes.  10 							94400824 Bytes	4891	6432	1346055027	RGB	8	600	chc02180000790012001.tif		2013-06-11	2013-06-11	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/chc0218/id/124	124	125.jp2	/chc0218/image/125.jp2
Page 13																											chc0218000079	chc02180000790013001		Day care was a particularly crucial issue in the development of the  "Training for Independence" project  because in the Cuban culture it is expected that all women will devote  their lives to their children,,  Therefore, one of the most threatening aspects of the training proposal to many  of the mothers was that it would mean  leaving their children to the care of  others.  The day care program has three  components: care of children under two  years of age in their own homes by  housekeeper-trained Cuban women; care  of children two to four years of age  in foster day care homes, and care of  children four to six years of age in a  day care center.  The total program is  supervised by a social worker and all  placements are arranged on an individualized, casework basis which takes  into consideration any special needs  the child may have.  Housekeeper Service  The housekeepers are selected  from women who have completed housekeeper training in the project's hotel  course.  Following additional orientation by the Cuban Child Welfare staff,  each housekeeper pays a get-acquainted  visit to the mother whose child she  will be caring for.  Subsequently, she  goes to the mother's home each day and  remains until the mother returns from  her classes.  This relatively expensive method of caring for small children is felt to be justified, not only  because it gives the housekeeper needed income while she is gaining experience that will help her to get a full  time job later, but also because, by  the time the mothers complete their  training and are employed, most of the  infants will be old enough to be accepted by a foster home or day care  center.  A plan to reduce the cost of  the service by placing a housekeeper  in one home and having three or four  mothers, living within a four block  radius, bring their infants there, had  to be abandoned because not enough  trainees with small children lived in  such close proximity.  The idea is  valid, however, under proper circumstances.  Foster Day Care Homes  The foster day care mothers, who  take the two to four year olds into  their homes for care, have been selected by the social work staff primarily from women who had previously  given foster care to unaccompanied  Cuban children and who thus have had  considerable experience in working  with the Child Welfare staff. All of  their homes have been inspected and  licensed for foster care.  Each foster day care mother cares for 8 to 15  children and is assisted by a day  care aid - a Cuban woman who has  either had experience in pre-school  work in Cuba or has graduated from the  child care training program.  The foster day care mother receives a contract from the Program which covers  her cost (including liability insurance) of transporting the children to  and from the English Center, employing the day care aide (one aide is  considered necessary for each five  Children Come To Training Center  With Their Mothers.

ERROL  T.   BALLANFONTE,  Field   Representative,  Miami HARRY  B.   LYFORD,  Editor  FIRST CLASS IN 'TRAINING FOR INDEPENDENCE' PROJECT IS READY FOR RESETTLEMENT OPPORTUNITIES  Visitors to the school system's English Center are impressed by the enthusiastic chanting of the adult Cuban classes, repeating words and sentences after bilingual instructors.  There is stress of familiar  phrases and the every-day need of how to ask the right  questions in the proper way. Little scenes are enacted  with refugees posing as visitors to stores, asking  where to locate a product,and other refugees acting as  information clerks directing them to proper counters.  The TRAINING FOR INDEPENDENCE project for Cuban refugee  women is well under way.  Its first "graduation" class received certificates the other day.  Thirty-two women  -- heads of families in need of skills to make them self-  supporting -- finished a course in "commercial housekeeping," designed to train them in a saleable service.  The occasion had recognition in the Miami community,  where the women receive financial assistance from the U.S.  Cuban Refugee Program.  The Miami HERALD reported that  those finishing the course "will now find it easier to  locate jobs in American hotels and motels." Interviewing  one of them, the reporter learned that some of the women  had misgivings about starting the course.  "We complained the first week," the refugee confided.  "Then we found we were having a good time and now we are  sorry it is over.  We learned so much.  It is good to  train for a job and it is good to feel you are part of  something."  This recommendation of the training project from one  who took it supports the theory that launched it.  "Often we are told by possible sponsors that refugees  must know English and have a skill," explains John F.  Thomas, Director of the Cuban Refugee Program.  "We were  convinced that to meet the need for resettling more than  3,000 women in self-supporting situations we had to ask  them to take intensive English training and vocational  education."  "It's the special eagerness of the Cuban refugees to  learn that makes working with them such a joy," say  the instructors. "We all manage to get well acquainted  and have a good time while everybody makes progress."  With the cooperation of the Dade County (Miami) Board  of Public Instruction, this special training for women is  now supplementing the regular English and vocational  courses that have been available to all refugees registered at the Center.  Two courses besides housekeeping are popular -- the receptionist-clerk-office machine course, giving basic training for office duties, and power sewing machine, which  leads to openings in the garment industry.  More than 1,000 women have started TRAINING FOR INDEPENDENCE work and new classes continue  to be filled. As they enroll the Resettlement Agency with which they are registered is notified, and planning for opportunities in resettlement for them is begun.  "In the early months of the new year, the project's 'production line' will be making available qualified women refugees to prospective sponsors and employers all over the country," said  Mr. Thomas.  "We hope that the American people, through their voluntary agencies, will continue  to provide sponsorships."

The second is enrollment in vocational courses to prepare women for jobs that can be made available to them  in various parts of the country.  Both the English and vocational classes will be carried on in  an arrangement with the Dade County (Miami) Board of Public Instruction, funds provided through  the Cuban Refugee Program.  Vocational courses for hand sewing, sewing machine work, office  machine operation, clerical assistants, nursing aides, domestic service in hotels and motels,  and other duties will be scheduled later in the year.

Vocational classes have long been offered and attended by Cuban refugees in Miami, but the current  project is directed toward more than 3,000 women heads  of families who are in need of intensive English  courses, and then an opportunity to fit themselves for  a livelihood including, in many cases, support of  children.  With a nationwide effort to combat poverty much in  the news, the special efforts to assist these refugees  who have not yet become self-supporting is looked upon  as a practical experiment that may offer possibilities  for self-help encouragement among groups in the American population, or groups of other national origins.

Hopes are that some  130 mothers can take training knowing that satisfactory arrangements have been made for the care of their children  during the time they are absent from home to attend  classes. More than 175 children may be involved in the  child care plan, which is under the supervision of Mrs. Dorothy McCrary,  Director of the Child Welfare Cuban Services Program.

The content of the foster day  care program is planned and supervised  by a staff member of the Child Welfare  Agency whose training and experience  has been in pre-school education. This  assures that the children are not  merely entertained in a safe and pleasant environment, but have an experience which makes a positive contribution to their healthy growth and  development.  The foster mothers receive program content and general  supervision from the agency staff  member on a weekly basis.  They are  also trained to observe the children  carefully and report to the social  worker any problems that may indicate  a need for medical or social services.  Day Care Center  The day care center cares for a  larger number of children.  It operates much the same as the foster day  care program except that the program  content is adjusted to the older age  group and includes more use of English  and other activities to prepare the  children for entrance in school.  Unlike the purchase-for-service system  which is used for the foster day care  program, the day care center is run  directly by the Child Welfare agency.  The day care center is located  in YMCA which is operated and used exclusively by Cubans o  Since the adults  make little use of the building during  the day, there was no problem about  finding and equipping a suitable area  for the day care activities.  Career Opportunities  All personnel in the day care  program are Cubans.  For the foster  home mothers, the program offers an  opportunity to women who need to earn  a living and yet remain at home. Typical of the women selected is Mrs. MM".  Because her school age children are on  different school hour schedules, it is  necessary for her to be at home  throughout the day.  But it is also  necessary for Mrs. M to have an income  which will support herself and her  children because her husband, is a political prisoner in Cuba and it is unlikely that Mrs. ffMM will ever be able  to get any support from him.  Through  the foster day care program, Mrs. M  can meet both the economic and personal needs of her children and at the  same time perform a much needed service.  The child care aides are also  women who must support themselves and  their families, but they are women who  do not need to remain at home all day.  Typically these are older women whose  children no longer need day time care.  Through the day care program, they  have an opportunity to put into practice the knowledge of child care and  development which they learned in the  child care training program and, with  the inevitable expansion of day care  programs which must occur, nationwide,  if needy mothers are to be expected to  work, they are gaining experience in a  career which will support them throughout their working lives.  Mothers Share Gains  The benefits of the day care program, not only to the children but also  to the mothers, are apparent in many  ways. Without a doubt, the day care  program has proved the greatest factor  in motivating the mothers to succeed in  their work training program. As they  see their children becoming more self-  reliant, overcoming behavior problems,  and playing happily with other children,  the mothers1 concerns about their welfare are diminished. A mother is  proud and pleased when her child comes  home with a valentine or other present  for her that he has made himself or  sings a song he has learned at school.  Through the experiences of even  these very young children, mothers  learn much about modern methods of  child rearing that not only helps them  in "Americanizing" their home life but  14 							94026788 Bytes	4855	6454	567238353	RGB	8	600	chc02180000790016001.tif		2013-06-11	2013-06-11	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/chc0218/id/128	128	129.jp2	/chc0218/image/129.jp2
Page 17																											chc0218000079	chc02180000790017001		also in overcoming the poverty culture  which is common to any impoverished  group, whether Cuban or American. As  the children progress, the fatalistic,  present-oriented attitude of the parents - a major obstacle to rehabilitation of any dependent group - diminishes and the mothers begin to show  real enthusiasm for a program that requires a considerable output of effort  on their part, over many months, before they can reap any tangible gains.  When the mothers complete their  training, graduation ceremonies are  held for the children, as well as the  mothers, and for most of the children  the occasion does indeed mark a significant step toward maturity*.  The  mothers clearly recognize this. Often  they borrow cameras to bring to the  graduation ceremony and take pictures  of their children as they receive  their diplomas.  The picture becomes  a treasured possession, shown proudly  to anyone who expresses an interest  in the child.  One Mother!s Description of Program  Mrs. "N" was one of the women  who experienced great conflict about  placing her pre-school child in day  care.  The child's leg had been injured when he was seven months old. He  had had two operations and would have  to have a third at a future date. At  the time Mrs. "N" enrolled in the project, Manuel, then three, was still  wearing the cast that had been put on  after his last operation.  Because of  his serious health problem Mrs. "N"  had an exceptionally close relationship with him and she was very much  worried that foreign matter would get  into his cast or some other catastrophe would befall him if he was placed  with a group of other children under  the care of a stranger.  Describing the experience a year  later - she was then working as a  switchboard operator in a large hotel  she said that her initial concern  about placing Manuel in day care was  as nothing compared to her concern  over the discontinuance of the day  care service when her training was  completed.  Manuel was equally concerned.  For three days, he refused  to eat and kept asking "Mama, why  can't I go to school?" His old traits  of food phobias, temper tantrums, and  helplessness - which had disappeared  under the day care regime - began to  reappear.  Miami, in common with most communities, has very inadequate day care  facilities.  To get a child into one  of the few good facilities, one must  enter him two to three years before he  is due to attend.  Most women of  low  income rely on what is known as the  "dollar a day" facility.  This is usually a bedroom in a slum area whose  occupant, without benefit of day care  license, will keep about 15 children  whose mothers pay her a dollar a day  and leave a sandwich for the child's  noon meal.  The children simply sit or  sleep on the floor until their mothers  return. Restless or troublesome children are given tranquilizers.  Mrs. "N", however, was determined to find a good day care facility  for Manuel and refused to work until  she did so. After three months, she  was able to place him in a nursery  operated by a church that had become  interested in her welfare. At first,  the placement was tentative since the  nursery was fearful about accepting a  handicapped child. After receiving a  report on his adjustment in the project day care program, however,  the  nursery director agreed to accept him  on a trial basis for one week.  Much  to both his own and his mother's relief, Manuel "made good" and was accepted for continuing care.  Another mother, as determined as  Mrs. N that her child should not be  placed in sub-standard care when she  completed her training, is now paying  almost a third of her salary for the  child's care in a licensed facility.

Unquestionably the value of the "Training for Independence" project, particularly in terms of the welfare of the  children, is seriously diminished by  the failure of the community to maintain a fully adequate day care program.  Conversely, while the mothers  are in training, the day care program  makes a demonstrable contribution to  their ability to benefit from the  classes.  Some mothers make their own  arrangements for their children with  relatives or friends.  A study, however, shows far fewer  absences of mothers with children in  the Day Care program than those leaving children in the care of relatives  or friends.  There is also a great deal of  evidence in the attitudes and performance of the two groups that the mothers whose children are in organized  day care are far more committed and  interested in their courses than are  the mothers whose children are cared  for by neighbors, friends or relatives.  USE OF COMMUNITY RESOURCES  A third distinguishing feature  of the "Training for Independence"  project is the extent to which it  seeks out and obtains cooperative relationships with other organizations.  This is a logical extension of the  traditional approach used by the Cuban  Refugee Program.  From the outset,  this Program has relied extensively  upon churches, civic groups, and in-  dustries in carrying out its mission -  Resettlement.  Its tremendous success  in resettlement (over 174,000 Cubans  had been resettled by early 1968 and  live in every State of the Union) is  due entirely to the development of  strong cooperative relationships -  with the national Voluntary Resettlement Agencies and through them to the  churches and community groups and finally to the individuals who sponsor  and befriend the newly arrived Cuban  family.  Public Agencies  The two agencies that have cooperated most closely in developing and  carrying out the project have been the  Dade County Board of Public Instruction and the Florida Department of  Public Welfare.  The design of both the English  and vocational training classes was  primarily the work of staff of the  Board of Public Instruction and a number of staff members of the agency  work full time with Cuban mothers at  both the English Center and the vocational training school.  The social service aspects of  the program are primarily the work of  the State Department of Public Welfare.  Through Mrs. Fern Pence,  Director of the Department's Family  Service Bureau and Miss Frances Davis,  Director of its Child Welfare Bureau,  basic plans for gearing public assistance and child welfare services were  developed.  Major responsibility for  actually organizing and carrying out  the total social service program -  counselling with the mothers, organizing the day care program etc. - has  been assumed throughout by Mrs.  Dorothy McCrary, Director of the Cuban  unit of the State's Child Welfare  Bureau, with a small staff consisting  chiefly of Cuban social workers.  16 							94336936 Bytes	4847	6486	1486171623	RGB	8	600	chc02180000790018001.tif		2013-06-11	2013-06-11	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/chc0218/id/130	130	131.jp2	/chc0218/image/131.jp2

They proved as helpful in resettling  the newly trained Cuban mothers as  they had been in resettling the more  routine and more easily adjusted families.  Their workers have counselled  and encouraged these insecure women,  lessening their fears of moving to a  strange community. Although, because  of the Cuban women's own preferences  and the demand for them in the Miami  labor market, most of the trainees  have remained in the Miami area, some  200 had been resettled by early 1968.  The local church, which made a  place for the crippled Cuban boy in  its day care center, was not unique.  Most of the children who receive adequate day care after their mothers go  to work are in church sponsored facilities.  Donations of equipment and material by industries and other groups  have been numerous.  In fact, the advanced power-sewing machine class has  been able to outfit many Headstart  children in the area by using scrap  materials donated by garment factories  for their practice work.  Most cooperative of all, perhaps,  has been the Cuban community of Miami  in encouraging the women, in offering  jobs and helping them make good, and  in caring for the children.  One of  the most helpful foster home mothers  is a wealthy Cuban woman, who came to  this country with two servants at a  time when it was possible to transfer  resources here.  She has not only  opened her home to the children and  the staff who care for them, but both  she and her servants give a great deal  of personal attention to each child.  Facilities  Traditionally the Program has  sought out and learned to make do  with facilities that would otherwise  be useless.  Freedom Tower, which  houses the Cuban Refugee Center, is  an office building that had long been  vacant after the newspaper company  which built it moved to other quarters.  Freedom House, where Cubans  can live for a few weeks immediately  after they arrive, was once an Air  Force Officers Club quarters, but had  not been used for many years.  It is  not surprising therefore that when a  new activity is to be launched, the  Staff immediately think in terms  of  "what isn't being used?" In the case  of the training project, the answer  was an abandoned school building for  the training facility and a Cuban  community recreation center that was  being used only at night as the place  for the day care facility.  In its record with the training  project, as in its total program, the  Cuban Refugee Program offers proof  that limitations of staff,  of funds,  or of facilities need not be deterrents to carrying out a worthwhile  activity.  With determination, resourcefulness, and the ability to tap  the reservoir of good will and helpfulness that exists in every community,  a well-designed project can secure the  resources it needs.  To enhance these staff qualities,  Program management has insisted on,  and vigorously guarded, operational  flexibilities.  This posture enables  the staff to react quickly and intelligently to needs, eliminate obstacles  and, in general, overcome any timidity  in going forward to desired goals.

Once again, planeloads of refugees began to arrive each day and  once again hundreds of refugees requiring hundreds of services swarmed  into Freedom Tower.  But this time the problem families have not been sidetracked to live  indefinitely on their meager public  assistance checks.  All women with  children dependent upon them for support are immediately screened to determine whether enrollment in the project would be beneficial to them.  Since families arriving under the airlift program consist only of persons  who have relatives in this country,  the majority do not need the services  offered by the project.  However, a  considerable number will need this  training.  Therefore, almost every  planeload of refugees carries a few  women with children who have no one to  support them even temporarily.  The immediate enrollment of these  women in the project has unquestionably made their adjustment easier.  There is no period of aimless living  with nothing to look forward to except  the next public assistance check; a  period described by one of the trainees as "the time of despair".  The welcome given to all refugees  upon arrival is still warm in their  hearts.  (Immediately upon debarkation,  all the refugees enter a room where  they are welcomed, told about all  available services, and served refreshments by volunteers.  Those who go to  Freedom House for temporary care - and  most of those who are not met by relatives - are further welcomed with special gift packages prepared by volunteers, including school children in all  parts of the country and distributed by  the Red Cross.  Everyone receives $5  spending money immediately with no  questions asked).  Thus, in contrast to the AFDC  mother who has usually suffered numerous rebuffs before enrolling in a  training project and in contrast to  the earlier trainees in this project  who had also endured months, if not  years, of frustration previously,  today's enrollee enters the "Training  for Independence" project with a  genuine feeling that she is welcome  and that the project will indeed lead  her to a bright future.  Chronic Dependency Can Be Prevented  As a result, the project is no  longer dealing with problems of chronic  dependency. Although the basic nature  of the caseload is the same - unmarried  mothers, women with marital problems,  low educational levels, lack of work  experience - no backlog of dependency  cases has developed. Whereas in mid-  1964, when the project was launched  and when there had been no influx of  new arrivals for many months, there  were 3,800 female heads of families who  were dependent upon public assistance,  in January, 1968, after new arrivals  had been coming in at the rate of 200  a day for almost two years, only 341  female heads of families were receiving public assistance. A few have  prospects for resettlement or jobs or  have health or other problems which  made it unfeasible to enroll them immediately.  Some will no doubt be enrolled later; most will be found to  have other plans which makes enrollment unnecessary.  LOOKING AHEAD  With a smaller caseload, staff of  the project are now focusing their attention on how to improve it.  Supervision is given by the Director of the  Cuban Child Welfare unit, a graduate  social worker with long experience,  and her assistant.  Plans under this  new system, call for a great deal more  emphasis upon pre-enrollment counselling and for continuous study and evaluation of each case.  18 							94589872 Bytes	4866	6478	145810123	RGB	8	600	chc02180000790020001.tif		2013-06-11	2013-06-11	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/chc0218/id/132	132	133.jp2	/chc0218/image/133.jp2
Page 21																											chc0218000079	chc02180000790021001		Since health problems -- some valid, many questionable -- account for  most absences from the training classes,  a plan is now being considered for giving each woman a very thorough medical  examination before she is enrolled.  This will not only help staff to determine whether the mother's problems are  emotional or physical but will also uncover latent or existing medical problems which are not found under the present system of referring mothers for  health care only when they complain of  an acute illness.  Efforts will continue to be made  to have more homogeneous groupings of the  women in the training classes.  It is  found to be difficult for the trainees as  well as for the teachers when classes are  made up of women whose educational background ranges from no formal schooling to  an 8th or 9th grade education.  The child welfare staff finds it  much easier to work with mothers who  have not been left hopeless and adrift  for months or years prior to entering  the project.  The class teachers find  it inspiring to work with these women.  Employers who recruit from these  classes once usually do so repeatedly.  The attitude of the mothers is well  expressed by Mrs. N, the mother who  feared to place her crippled boy in  day care.  She recently wrote to the  Program:  "I send gratitude for the study  plan that made possible my attendance  at English Center.  I liked my teachers and the way that care of our  children was carried out.  The tenderness and affection shown my boy is  something I wonft soon forget".  Upon completion of training, day care  services are continued on an individual  case basis while the mother seeks employment, or until her first salary check is  received.

John F. Thomas Program Director, Washington, D, C.  Errol T, Ballanfonte Refugee Center Director  Eugenio Sánchez Torrente Editor  LO QUE DEBEMOS  SABER SOBRE EL  PROGRAMA  PALABRAS DEL DR. JACK MCKENZIE  El Dr. Jack McKenzie, Director de los Servicios Médicos  del Programa para Refugiados Cubanos, nos ha facilitado para  la publicidad las siguientes informaciones:  1« Los refugiados que confronten una verdadera emergencia  pueden acudir al Dispensario Médico sin necesidad de  turno.  2. En horas en que el Dispensario Médico del Centro no está  abierto, los cubanos refugiados en activo (actualmente  recibiendo ayuda médica), que tengan una emergencia, pueden ir a la sala de emergencia del hospital más cercano.  3. El Programa para Refugiados Cubanos no autorizará los  pagos por atención médica a los hospitales en casos menores que no requieran tratamientos considerados como  una verdadera emergencia. En este último caso el refugiado es responsable del pago de la cuenta.  PROTECCIÓN DONDEQUIERA QUE EL REFUGIADO VA  LOS CUBANOS REFUGIADOS AL SALIR DE MIAMI, para cuales-  quier estado del país, reciben una tarjeta dirigida a los  Gerentes de las Oficinas Locales del State Employment Service de toda la nación en la que se explica: "El portador ha  sido reubicado a esa localidad. Sírvase prestarle la ayuda  necesaria para conseguirle empleo adecuado. Deberán considerarse, cuando sea necesario, facilidades para tomar cursos de Inglés y vocacionales, a fin de mejorar las oportunidades de empleo para el interesado". Esta tarjeta le  sirve para presentarse al personal de la oficina estatal  del Servicio de Empleos en la localidad que el refugiado ha  escogido para radicarse. Cuando un cubano refugiado necesita ayuda para obtener empleo o quiere asistir a cursos  especiales para aprender profesiones u oficios debe visitar  la oficina local del State Employment Service. Todos los  servicios de estas oficinas están a su entera disposición y  son completamente gratis. Es bueno que los cubanos traten  de adquirir habilidad en el idioma Inglés para entender y  hacerse entender a la vez, pero si no lo han logrado, en el  momento en que necesita esta ayuda, debe acudir a estas dependencias con otra persona que le sirva de interprete.  Esto ultimo le permitirá resolver mejor su problema. Como  acabamos de ver el Programa para Refugiados Cubanos  sigue  atendiendo y orientando al refugiado, en sus momentos de  mayor urgencia, aún en los más apartados rincones del territorio americano.  SUGERENCIAS DEL DIRECTOR  EL SR. ERROL T. BALLANFONTE recomienda a los cubanos refugiados, tanto a los niños como a los jóvenes y adultos  que tengan siempre a mano sus certificados de nacimiento.  Esta sugerencia se basa en que hay ciertos trámites privados u oficiales que requieren la posesión de este documenta  Cita como ejemplo el caso de la Inter City Athletic Conference que demanda la presentación del certificado de nacimiento a todos aquellos jóvenes refugiados que deseen participar de sus actividades deportivas.  ANIVERSARIO DEL GRITO DE YARA  1868 - 1968: CENTENARIO  PARALELOS HISTÓRICOS. Un reportaje oral que adivinamos  en el Dr. Jorge Carro, uno de los participantes del curso  para Bibliotecarios que está teniendo lugar en Kansas State  Teacher's College de Emporia, patrocinado por el Programa  para Refugiados Cubanos.  Carro: De vez en cuando es bueno analizar la historia.  Si vamos a las páginas del diario de un refugiado de la  emigración cubana, de hace un siglo, podemos leer: "íPor  fin estoy en territorio de los Estados Unidos! tPor fin  puedo respirar libremente.1 'Bendita esta tierra de progreso  y libertad.'" José de Armas, The Cuban Revolution, New York,  1868, p.2. Y si acudimos a las páginas del Boletín No. 40  del Municipio de Guantánamo en el exilio, de Julio de 1968,  sección "Buzón" (Síntesis de cartas recibidas), nos encontramos con un párrafo como éste: "Antes que nada un saludo  afectuoso a todos los guantanameros, tanto en mi nombre como en el de todos los que nos encontramos residiendo en el  exilio, en estas acogedoras tierras de California" Gerardo  Arenado (Tito), Santa Ana, California. Y sigamos hurgando  el pasado. Juan Arnao en Páginas de la historia, New York,  1877, escribía: "Nueva York, Filadelfia y Nueva Orleans se  llenaron de familias (refugiadas)... y Cayo Hueso, Tampa,  Charleston y Baltimore dieron hospitalidad y ofrecieron  trabajo a la clase de artesanos..." Esto era, como podemos  ver, cuando tenía lugar en Cuba la llamada Guerra de los  Diez Anos. Ahora, en septiembre de 1968, nos admiramos  con informaciones como éstas: "Más de 53,752 cubanos refugiados se han ido a residir a Nueva York; En Filadelfia hay  unos 2,000; más de 4,000 en New Orleans, unos 700 en Cayo  Hueso; sobre 3,000 en Tampa; cerca de 50 en Charleston; 500  en Baltimore...y todos triunfan trabajando en labores manuales o profesionales", tomado de GDR del Departamento de  Salud, Educación y Bienestar Social. Por otra parte Gerardo Castellanos en Motivos de Cayo Hueso, La Habana, 1935,  refiriéndose al hecho cierto de que la distribución de los  cubanos refugiados en 1869 por el territorio americano no  afectaba fundamentalmente la unidad espiritual de la nación cubana, dijo: "Reuniones y comidas guardaban el mismo sabor que en la patria cercana. Los nativos aprendieron  nuestro idioma..."Para continuar enfatizando: "... en tal  orfandad, sin más armas defensivas que la virtud y el trabajo, para lograr la afirmación en el elemento nativo, que  generalmente teme y rechaza al inmigrante competidor, imponíase la cordialidad que los empalmara en homogénea colonia.  En la disgregación estaría la muerte..." Y finaliza diciendo: "Por eso, cuando Cuba fue libre, los cubanos no necesitaron muchas horas para amarrar bártulos y trasplantar  el campamento. Habían sido como las abejas. Laboraron honrada y tesoneramente". Hoy podemos afirmar lo mismo. Por  eso estamos nosotros por acá, por Kansas, estudiando y,  otros miles trabajando y estudiando, repartidos por todas  partes. Es todo cuanto quería decirles. Gracias. ACLARACIÓN: Como acabamos de ver, la historia se repite. Si bien  es cierto que en 1868 Cayo Hueso "ofrecía mejores condiciones para obreros que los demás lugares", hoy en 1968, suman  millares las ciudades y los pueblos, repartidos por toda la  Unión, que brindan mejores oportunidades que el Cayo Hueso  de hace 100 años. Nos remitimos a la prueba. Venga al Centro para Refugiados Cubanos y visite las Agencias Voluntarias (Católica, HIAS, Protestante y Rescate Internacional)  donde le darán amplios informes sobre las condiciones de  vida a todo lo largo y ancho de este país. 							105996364 Bytes	5210	6780	2965603903	RGB	8	600	chc02180000820002001.tif		2013-06-11	2013-06-11	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/chc0218/id/138	138	139.jp2	/chc0218/image/139.jp2

Las ilustraciones han sido hechas por el gran caricaturista SILVIO, quien, de esta  manera, coopera una vez más con nosotros en nuestro afán de hacer más fáciles y comprensibles las informaciones  al cubano refugiado.  G ¿Es cierto que los números de núcleos son  asignados en Cuba?  RESPUESTA: Los nombres de las personas  tentativamente aprobadas para salir de Cuba  son incluidos en la Lista Maestra Cubana, la  cual se origina en Cuba. El gobierno de Cuba  da a cada grupo familiar un número llamado  NUMERO DE NÚCLEO.  Sin el número de núcleo no es posible determinaren el Centro para Refugiados Cubanos,  si los nombres de las personas reclamadas  han sido recibidos en las listas enviadas a los  Estados Unidos de América.  El Centro para Refugiados Cubanos notifica  por correo a la persona, en los Estados Unidos,  identificada por sus familiares en Cuba como  su reclamante, tan pronto como llega de Cuba  el núcleo que le corresponde a su familia, relacionándose los nombres de las personas incluidas en este número de núcleo. Esta es la  primera de dos notificaciones que se envían al  reclamante. La segunda se manda después  que el caso ha sido procesado en los Estados  Unidos y los nombres enviados a Cuba. Esta  segunda notificación es para que el reclamante la guarde consigo. NO DEBE DEVOLVERLA AL CENTRO. La salida de Cuba por los  Vuelos de la Libertad es controlada por las  autoridades cubanas y ninguna persona o  autoridad, en los Estados Unidos, tiene ningún  medio de conocer, por adelantado, cuando el  gobierno cubano autorizará la salida.  □ ¿Donde se rectifican los errores que pueden  aparecer en las listas de reclamados?  RESPUESTA: Los errores que pueden aparecer  en las listas de reclamados deben rectificarse  en Cuba. Para llevar a efecto esa rectificación  los familiares, en Cuba, deben escribir a la  Embajada de Suiza, en la Habana e incluir  una copia de su certificado de nacimiento, o  su pasaporte, o cualquier otro documento  oficial que muestre el nombre completo,  correctamente, así como la fecha y el lugar  de su nacimiento.

Ya, además de  OPORTUNIDADES, hay otras publicaciones -éstas comerciales-  que dedican secciones y páginas completas para sumarse a  este movimiento de justicia para con los que están haciendo  grandes esfuerzos de superación fuera de Miami. En esta  foto tenemos a dos triunfadores en el campo de la educación. Se trata del Dr. Miguel Comas Leal y su esposa la  Sra. Mirta Comas, ambos graduados en Pacific University. El  primero acaba de ser nombrado profesor en Fortuna Senior  High School y la segunda comenzó a trabajar como maestra de  Español en Cudiback Elementary School, Fortuna, California.  Vinieron de visita por Miami y visitaron la Agencia Católica que dirige Hugh McLoone a quien dieron las gracias por  haberlos ayudado en su traslado a aquel lugar.  ESTE ES EL DR. ANTONIO GUARDIOLA que nos visitó hace  unas semanas y nos contó sus éxitos en el Norte. Vino  acompañado de su esposa la Dra. Aurora Hernández que partió  con él en el año 1964 para Kutztown, Pennsylvania, lugar  donde tomaron ambos un curso para hacerse maestros de Español. Graduados ya están de profesores en la Universidad de  Indiana de aquel estado. Su triunfo ha sido en grande. Visitaron Miami en calidad de turistas cubanos que no olvidan  su Patria. El Dr. Guardiola se asomó a nuestra VENTANA  ABIERTA, de Diario Las Americas y conversó, hace unas semanas, con nuestros lectores.

LUIS MARTINEZ FERNANDEZ, acompañado de su hijo  Luis de Jesús, estudiante de tercer año de premédica, en la  Universidad de Puerto Rico, recinto de Mayagüez, nos visitó  la semana pasada. El Dr. Luis Martínez es el director de  las páginas literarias del periódico EL DÍA y profesor de  la Universidad Católica de Puerto Rico. Se interesó en conocer detalles en relación con los diferentes programas y  proyectos culturales y educacionales que patrocina el Programa para Refugiados Cubanos. La extraordinaria labor  desplegada por el Dr. Martínez, primero en el Colegio Pon-  ceño de Varones y, ahora, en la Universidad Católica, lo  han hecho acreedor de innumerables honores por parte de las  autoridades educacionales de aquel lugar y de sus alumnos.  Agradecidos por su amable visita. El triunfo del padre y  el triunfo del hijo son logros óptimos de la Cuba desterrada.  VISITAS DISTINGUIDAS  LOS PRINCIPALES PROGRAMAS DE RADIO de Costa Rica estuvieron representados por este grupo selecto de Comentaristas, Periodistas y Locutores que nos visitó la semana pasada. Son ellos: Carlos F. Peña, Administrador de Radio  Monumental; Luis A. Corella, Vice-Presidente de Radio Columbia; José E. Garnier, Director de Revista de la Prensa;  Hernán Alvarado, Administrador General de la Cadena Musical; Levi Vega, Director de los programas de noticias del  Canal 3 de T.V.; Roger Barahona, Presidente de Radio Cadena  Nacional; Luis R.

La visita constituyó un motivo de  regocijo para nosotros tanto por la calidad intelectual y  profesional de los visitantes como por el interés mostrado  en nuestro Programa.  LA SRA. IRIS S. MARTINEZ es una activa Trabajadora Social encargada de recibir y orientar en Nueva York a los  cubanos refugiados que escogen esa populosa y gran ciudad  para residir. Sus oficinas son las de Church World Service  (Protestante) que en el Centro para Refugiados Cubanos dirige el Rev. Miguel Pszyk. En la foto, junto a la Sra.  Martínez, aparece su hija Cynthia que estudia en Saint Sergio High School de Park Avenue y el Sr. David Ortíz, de la  misma Agencia, en Miami. Muy hermosas palabras tuvo la  Sra. Iris S. Martínez para los cubanos refugiados. De Victor Hugo nos dijo: "El taller y el ideal son el doble laboratorio de donde sale la doble vida, la vida del cuerpo y  la vida de la inteligencia". Se estaba refiriendo a los  cubanos autodistribuidos por todo el país, cuyo tesón en el  trabajo aplaude, y cuyas preocupaciones por la libertad admira. Agradecidos por la visita cordial de la Sra. Martínez y su hija al Centro para Refugiados Cubanos de Miami.  EL SEÑOR ANTONIO ARIAS tiene bajo su responsabilidad el  programa "Opinión Publica" que se transmite cada noche a  las 10:00 por WFAB,La Fabulosa, de Miami. Vino hasta nuestras oficinas de Relaciones e Información Publica solicitando datos del Programa para Refugiados Cubanos. Agradecemos todas estas visitas, e invitamos, una vez más, a toda  la Prensa, nacional e internacional, e interesados en el  Programa, a que nos sigan visitando.  UN GRUPO NUTRIDO DE ESTUDIANTES de la Universidad Central de Venezuela estuvo varias horas en nuestras oficinas  conociendo la forma cómo funciona el Programa para Refugiados Cubanos en relación con la ayuda que presta a los niños  y jóvenes cubanos refugiados que desean realizar estudios  en este país. Durante la entrevista logramos captar este  momento en que aparecen discutiendo unos con otros acerca  de sus puntos de vista respecto a este tema.

BALLANFONTE,  Field   Representative, HARRY   B.   LYFORD,   Editor  CUBAN REFUGEE PROGRAM ISSUES NEW CALL FOR RESETTLEMENT HELP IN EVERY PARS OF THE U.S. AS  PRESIDENT OFFERS SANCTUARY TO ALL WHO SEEK FREEDOM IN ! FAMILY REUNION1 PROPOSALS BY CASTRO  Jobs for Cubans escaping from oppression! The call goes out again to the American people -- those who have  helped Cubans before; those who may now be moved for the first time to offer new lives to our displaced neighbors.  Emphasized again is the slogan of this publication -- SPONSOR CUBAN REFUGEES; FULFILL THEIR FAITH IN FREEDOM. Castro's "family reunion" proposal, quickly accepted by the U.S., offers new challenges in all parts of  this country.  You yourself, your neighbors, your church, your social and civic organizations all can play humanitarian  roles in the project launched by President Johnson October 3 with these words: "I declare to the people of  Cuba that those who seek refuge here will find it."  (See statement below.)  This promise calls for prompt action -- probably in your own community if relatives of Cubans already there  will be coming to join them.  Let local resettlement groups know of your interest and your eagerness to offer  jobs.  If no Cuban relatives will be coming to your area, let the Cuban Refugee Center, Miami, know of your offer for any Cuban who needs a sponsor and employment.  (See Employment Questionnaire Page 2.)  Bear in mind the four Voluntary Agencies coordinated at the Center for resettlement details: Catholic Relief Services, Church World Service, International Rescue Committee, and United HIAS.  Through these agencies  Cuban refugees can be sent to your area.  Write for printed matter, resettlement films -- other aids to promote  interest!  WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID ABOUT THE CUBANS —  (From President Lyndon B. Johnson's remarks October 3, 1965 on the signing of  the new immigration bill beneath the Statue of Liberty in New York harbor)  "...I declare to the people of Cuba that those who seek refuge here will find it.  The  dedication of America to our tradition as an asylum for the oppressed will be upheld.  "I have directed the Department of Statej Justice; and Health, Education, and Welfare to  make all necessary arrangements to permit those in Cuba who seek freedom to make an orderly  entry into the United States.  "Our first concern will be with those Cubans who have been separated from children, parents, and husbands and wives now in this country.  Our next concern is with those who are  imprisoned for political reasons.  "I will send to the Congress a request for supplemental funds of $12,600,000 to carry forth this commitment.  "I have asked the Department of State to seek through the Swiss Government the agreement of the Cuban Government in a request to the President of the International Red Cross Committee.  The request is for the assistance of the Committee in processing the movement of refugees from Cuba to Miami.  Miami will serve as port of  entry -- and a temporary stopping place for refugees as they resettle in other parts of the country.  "To all the voluntary agencies in the United States, I appeal for their continuation and expansion of their  magnificent work.  Their help is needed in the reception and resettlement of those who choose to leave Cuba.  The Federal Government will work closely with these agencies in their tasks of charity and brotherhood.  (For Conclusion, See Page 2)  Even before Castro indicated that Cubans who  desired to go to the U.S. are now free to do  so, refugees were continuing to stream out  of their homeland by small boat.  Here are  some of the 67 men, women and children who  pushed off from Cuba in two small boats and  drifted three days without food and water.  They were picked up by a Panamanian motor  vessel, which notified the U.S. Coast Guard.  All but two men were transferred to a Coast  Guard cutter.  The two elected to stay with  one of the escape boats which was towed to  Key West.  The second escape boat broke loose  and was sunk.  After interrogations by the  Immigration Service the refugees registered  at the Cuban Refugee Center.

The Sertoma Club for refugees has already begun, through  its Florida headquarters and other Florida Sertoma clubs, to spread  the word that jobs for newly-arriving exiles are a must.  If your  own clubs are not getting the word, please act yourself to inform  club officers of this new and pressing need.  Emphasize that the  Cuban Refugee Program imposes a national responsibility in view of  further escapes from a neighboring communist-gripped island, and  that the whole world is watching American response to the needs of  those fleeing from oppression to the safety of the free world.  Any organization can help.  You can be the volunteer prompter of  action, by individuals and groups, that will bring to exiled Cubans  and their families the freedom opportunities they seek.  Won't you  make telephone calls to organization leaders today?  WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID ABOUT THE CUBANS --  (Conclusion, From Page 1)  "I want the people of this land to know of the enormous contribution which the compassionate citizens of Florida have made to humanity and decency.  All states in this union can join with Florida in  extending the hand of helpfulness and humanity to our Cuban brothers.  "The lesson of our times is sharp and clear in this movement of  people from one land to another.  Once again, it stamps the mark of  failure on a regime when many of its citizens voluntarily choose to  leave the land of their birth for a more hopeful home.  The future  holds little hope for any government where the present holds no hope  for the people.  "And so we will welcome these Cuban people. For the tides of  history run strong, and in another day, they can return to their  homeland to find it cleansed of terror and free from fear..."

They were picked up by a motor vessel and transferred to a U.S. Coast Guard cutter.  He is  pictured at the Cuban Refugee Center with his  young wife, Luz, and son, Raul, aged 18 months.  He plans part time work, along with study, to  qualify himself for carrying on in his profession in this country.  DISCRIMINATION PROHIBITED -- Title VI of  the Civil Rights Act of 1964 states:  "No  person in the United States shall, on the  grounds of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in,  be denied the benefits of, or be subject  to discrimination under any program or  activity receiving Federal financial assistance."  Therefore, the Cuban Refugee  Program, like every program or activity  receiving financial assistance from the  Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, must be operated in compliance with  this law.  JOB OFFERS COME IN BY PHONE AND MAIL;  PLEASE HELP SWELL THE VOLUME  Jobs, jobs, jobs.  They are being offered newly-arriving Cuban refugees by telephone and in hastily-written letters from  various parts of the U.S.  "We need auto mechanics," say some.  "What about shoe repairmen?" ask others.  "Are there tobacco  industry technicians?" is another inquiry.  Factory workers of  all kinds are in demand.  Some refugees can have jobs as typesetting machine operators, if they have training and experience.  It is too early to come up with a listing of principal categories of skills among the newcomers.  But the Refugee Center  and the cooperating Resettlement Agencies are willing to consider all offers.  However, the Agencies, through long experience in this and other refugee programs, do not look with favor  on placements to household services, or unskilled agricutural  duties.  They prefer to move families to urban family living  accommodations, with nearby work locations.  PLEASE USE THE EMPLOYMENT QUESTIONNAIRE FORM AT THE LEFT.

"Send on all the parents of our unaccompanied children who reach the U.S. in this new refugee program," is the message received by Catholic Relief Services, Cuban Refugee Center, Miami,  from Roy J. McDonald, Colfax, Wash.  An owner of nursing homes in Colfax and other areas, and president this last year of the  American Nursing Home Association, Mr. McDonald in 1962 was a prime mover in a project that  brought to Colfax 60 Cuban children who had been sent by their parents to this country to  avoid communist indoctrination.  In cooperatin with Rev. Cornelius Stefani, Hungarian refugee  who became priest of the Colfax parish, Mr. McDonald built up a concern for Cubans and, with  Father Stefani, made two trips to Miami to arrange for the children, and some 30 adult refugees, to go to Colfax.  An old academy building was restored to serve as a boarding school.  Now from Colfax comes the further heartening message that parents of the Cuban children there will be welcome  and jobs will be awaiting them, there or elsewhere. Mr. McDonald last year in Miami Beach was presented a Refugee Center citation for his helpfulness to the Cuban Refugee Program and to Catholic Relief Services.  McDonald  "FEW AMERICANS WOULD HAVE IT OTHERWISEn  MIAMI HERALD Editorial (Excerpts)  "Offering sanctuary to victims of persecution in other  lands is traditional in the U.S.  The open door has been  busy since Fidel Castro and his communist handlers sneaked  into power in Cuba nearly seven years ago.  Now we are  about to receive thousands more fugitives from a captive  island 90 miles from our shores.  Few Americans would have  it otherwise, despite the burdens and dangers involved,  which are considerable...The new wave of exiles should be  moved swiftly to other cities to lighten the impact on  Miami's economy..."  DIRECTOR THOMAS  "TEST MUST BE MET AS GOOD AMERICANS"  MIAMI NEWS Editorial (Excerpts)  "Miami Mayor Robert King High says he has assurances from Washington that the newcomers will  be rapidly relocated in other cities around the  nation...More than a third of the Cuban refugees  now in the U.S. live in Dade County (Miami)...  While many Cubans here have jobs it is doubtful  if work can be found for many more in this area  ...The program is apt to be a test of patience  and charity for South Floridians, but it is a  test that must be met as good Americans."  IN VIET NAM  John F. Thomas, Director of the Cuban Refugee Program, is in Viet Nam on short-term assignment in the interests of the refugee situation in that country.  His orders for that responsibility came just before the Castro  announcement that Cubans were free to leave their homeland for the U.S.  His staff members in Washington and  Miami are carrying on for him in the new Cuban development.  REFUGEES WITH RELATIVES IN CUBA CAN BE HELPED TO FILL OUT THIS FORM AND MAIL TO THE CENTER  The following letter, signed by Errol T. Ballanfonte, Field Representative in charge of the Cuban Refugee  Center, explains the identification form concerning Cuban refugee relatives in Cuba.  It was sent with copies  of the form to refugees throughout the U.S. who in registering at the Center recorded relatives in Cuba.  "The recent decision by President Johnson to give refuge to Cubans who are permitted to come into the  United States included the statement:  '...our first concern will be with those Cubans who have been separated from children, parents and husbands and wives now in this country.'

They  express an attitude, a national concern is a better way to put it, for the oppressed people of  the world.  If you have any doubts about letting more Cuban refugees into our homeland, say these words  over to yourself.  When Fidel Castro made his offer to let refugees out of Cuba last week, the "catch" seemed  obvious.  Castro, I figured, would send the sick, the lame, the blind.  He'd send the political malcontents, the poor, the people apt to cost his shaky government money.  Mixed in with these would be  a few spies.  Okay.  What if he does? The record of the Cuban refugee in this country — particularly Miami — is so good  that it would be unthinkable to exclude a new wave of refugees just to cause Castro problems.  Some 180,000 refugees have registered here since Castro took over.  Of that number, at least 92,000 have  been resettled in other parts of the country.  Counting our Cuban colony here prior to Castro, we have today  perhaps 90,000 Cubans living in the Miami area.  THINK A BIT  Think about these people for a minute.  Have you ever seen one begging? Have you ever seen one who wasn't  willing to work?  Perhaps you have.  But I'll guarantee you that you won't see many who fit the shiftless beggar definition.  They'll work.  They'll save.  And they'll take care of their own family members.  It took New York several generations to absorb and care for the waves of Irish, Italian and Jewish immigrants.  Miami took care of its Cubans in the space of a few years.  Or did the Cubans take a little help and take care  of themselves?  In any event, the absorption of the Cubans here has been a miracle.  The people at the Cuban Refugee Center tell me that some 2,000 refugees were pouring in here each week before  Castro cut off plane service between here and Havana in October '62.  The initial refugees were political refugees in the truest sense.  Then came the landowners, the businessmen,  the elite of Cuban commerce.  After that came the professional men, the doctors, the lawyers, the architects.  AN OPPORTUNITY  By '63, however, the working people of Cuba were pouring in.  These were people who couldn't make a living  under communism.  America was more an economic opportunity than a political asylum for these people.  If and when the new wave of refugees is allowed to start, we'll probably be drawing from this working class  category.  For most of them, Miami will be just a stopping off place. A refugee can't get government assistance today  unless the refugee agrees to resettlement. And Cubans have learned gradually that they can get better jobs by  leaving Florida. As a matter of fact, a rather large number of Miami's Cuban colony has resettled voluntarily  to get better jobs and be close to family members.  Castro may think he's the sly one unloading unwanted people on this country.  But he really isn't so sly.  So far, I think we've gotten the cream of the crop in Cuba.  These are people who have made a contribution to  this country and their children will do so in the future.  We'll do well to lift our lamp beside the golden door.  CUBANS CAN HELP CUBANS, WITH COMMUNITY SUPPORT  Cubans helping Cubans has resulted successfully in Los Angeles, and other places.  Now is the time for refugees already  resettled everywhere to come to the aid of the refugees still  to come -- regarding jobs, housing and other needs.  Americans  can help inform your Cuban groups about the community's planning, and gain their assistance.  CUBANS HELPING CUBANS can be  effective, with all-community support!

She  feared that they would be sent to Russia because she and her husband were actively opposed to the Castro regime. She asked the  judge of the juvenile court to find homes for  them. The judge assumed jurisdiction and  placed her children in foster care. The mother  returned to Cuba to be with her husband and  to continue her work in the counterrevolutionary movement.  This incident marked the beginning of a  rapid influx of Cuban children, many of  whom would be unaccompanied by their parents and with no relatives here to care for  them. The children came from all classes of  Cuban society, although the majority were  from well-to-do, middle-class families. Most  of them were in their early teens, and nearly  two-thirds were boys.  Voluntary agencies did what they could  to provide care and shelter for these children,  but it soon became apparent that they could  not carry on without the help of the Federal  Government.  In January 1961, President John F.  Kennedy asked the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, Abraham Ribicoff, to  plan and administer a Federal program to  deal with the needs of Cuban refugees while  in the United States and to expedite their  return to their homeland when conditions  made it possible.  The Cuban Refugee Program—the most  comprehensive program ever devised in this  country to meet the needs of incoming  refugees—was the first to entail the distribution of Federal financial assistance for maintenance outside of a refugee center. Provisions for the unaccompanied children were  made part of the overall plan.  The Children's Bureau, through delegation, was made responsible for child welfare  services, including the care and protection of  these unaccompanied Cuban children. The  Florida State Department of Public Welfare  acted as agent for the U.S. Department of  Health, Education, and Welfare in planning  for these children and in the use of Federal  funds for their care. The Florida State Department of Public Welfare, in turn, contracted with HIAS and the Miami voluntary  children's agencies—the Catholic Welfare  Bureau of the Diocese of Miami, the Children's Service Bureau, and the Jewish Family  and Children's Service—for arranging for  the placement of the children.  By April 30, 1967, the Federal Government had been responsible for the foster care  of over 8,300 children.  Practical problems that would have discouraged those less convinced of the importance of what they were doing beset the agencies and organizations at ev^ry turn. But they  persisted—and difficulties were finally overcome. It is this story that is told in CUBA'S  CHILDREN IN EXILE: The Story of the  Unaccompanied Cuban Refugee Children's  Program.  ^&gt; oVaaaxva-^   (J »     \-**tXi.  •C**^Asi  KATHERINE B.

As the year wore on, more and  more children were sent to the United States,  some with little or no guarantee that the relatives or friends would care for them. Homeless teenage boys were noticed in Miami.  The dramatic case of the two children  brought to the Key West Juvenile Court was  symptomatic of the problem that was to  mushroom into immense proportions within  a very short time.  Early arrivals  Most of the unaccompanied Cuban children who arrived in this country during 1960  were Catholic. As their numbers increased,  the Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Miami  became concerned about these children and  charged Father (later Monsignor) Bryan 0.  Walsh, Executive Director of the Catholic  Welfare Bureau, Miami, with responsibility  for them. The Catholic Welfare Bureau was a  small, licensed child caring and adoption  agency, then caring for about 80 children.  Father Walsh brought the problem to the  Welfare Planning Council of Dade County,  Florida. The Welfare Planning Council  called a meeting of local public and voluntary  agencies in the fall of 1960, and a Cuban  Refugee Committee was established to work  with Mr. Tracy Voorhees, Special Represen  tative of President Dwight D. Eisenhower.  Among the resolutions adopted by the Welfare Planning Council was one recommending that the Federal Government participate  in developing a plan for the care of unaccompanied Cuban refugee children.  When Mr. James Baker, Principal of the  Ruston Academy, an American school in  Havana, and several members of the American Chamber of Commerce in Havana heard  about Father Walsh's interest in unaccompanied children from Cuba, they asked his  aid for some Cuban parents who wanted to  send their children to the United States but  who had no one to look after them here.  Father Walsh agreed to help, and plans were  worked out for the children.  The basic idea was that these children  would come to the United States on student  visas. Because of many delays, only 25 of  these student visas had been issued when  diplomatic relations between the United  States and Cuba were broken on January 3,  1961. However, children who had tourist  visas began arriving in Miami on December  26, 1960, with the request that they be cared  for by the Catholic Welfare Bureau.  When diplomatic relations were broken,  the number of children in Havana for whom  Mr. Baker and his staff were seeking care  from the Catholic Welfare Bureau had grown  to 510. Mr. Baker returned to the United  States on January 4, and he and Father  Walsh began direct discussions with the U.S.  Department of State and the Immigration  1 							93535888 Bytes	4915	6342	371843078	RGB	8	600	chc02180000800004001.tif		2013-06-18	2013-06-18	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/chc0218/id/151	151	152.jp2	/chc0218/image/152.jp2

Within a few days, permission was  given to bring in 225 children on waivers of  the student visas with the understanding  that more waivers would be granted if  needed. By the time the Federal Government  took over the program, visa waivers were being granted in blocks of 500.  Jewish and Protestant children in Cuba  were also being helped through arrangements  made for their care by the appropriate voluntary child welfare agencies. The public child  welfare agencies in Miami were asked to help  but lacked funds to participate.  By February 1, 1961, 174 children had  come to the United States. Fifty-three of  these children were being cared for by relatives and friends, 119 by the Catholic Welfare Bureau, and 2 by the Jewish Family and  Children's Service. In addition, the Catholic  Welfare Bureau was caring for 15 children  who had arrived earlier and had been living  alone in Miami.  At this point, the Catholic Welfare  Bureau was caring for as many children as it  could. Most of them were boys over 14. They  were placed in existing institutions, in a new  institution able to house 26 boys, and in a  facility   borrowed   from  the   Dade   County  Welfare Department. A group of 40 children  brought en masse from a Cuban institution  were sent to a religious order in New Jersey.  A few were sent to a Philadelphia agency.  Father Walsh was then confronted with  the problem of caring for 500 children between the ages of 5 and 18 who were expected  to arrive in Miami within 3 weeks. Fortunately, he was able to work out plans with  directors of six Catholic charities in various  parts of the country to provide care in institutions for these Cuban children. Although  foster care in large institutions was undesirable for many children, the necessity of finding beds became an overriding consideration.  The Federal program begins  While planning was going on at the national level for the overall Cuban Refugee  Program, the Children's Bureau was working  with the Florida State Department of Public  Welfare to assess the problem of unaccompanied Cuban refugee children and to determine a workable plan.  On February 3, 1961, President Kennedy  directed the Secretary of Health, Education,  and Welfare, Abraham Ribicoff, to "provide  financial aid for the care and protection of  £  .

The Children's Bureau was assigned  responsibility to "negotiate and subsequently  supervise a contract or agreement with the  State of Florida to provide through voluntary  or public agencies a program for the care of  unaccompanied Cuban children."  The Florida State Department of Public  Welfare on February 21, 1961, signed an  agreement to develop an emergency program  to provide temporary aid for Cuban refugees,  including care and protection of unaccompanied children. The agreement provided for  the use of Federal funds in carrying out the  plan.  The Florida State Department of Public  Welfare, acting as an agent of the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare,  awarded contracts effective March 1, 1961,  to three voluntary agencies in Miami and an  international agency headquartered in New  York City to provide foster care for unaccompanied Cuban refugee children. These agencies were:  The Catholic Welfare Bureau, Inc.  Miami, Florida  The Children's Service Bureau of Dade County,  Inc.  Miami, Florida  The Jewish Family and Children's Service, Inc.  Miami, Florida  The United HIAS Service  New York, New York  The Florida State Department of Public  Welfare contract with the voluntary agencies  provided for reimbursement with Federal  funds for the cost of providing foster care  for these Cuban refugee children. Reimbursement rates of $6.50 per day for each child in  group care and $5.50 per day for each child in  foster family care were established to cover  the agencies' direct care costs and administrative expenses.  Direct care costs were for food, shelter,  ..  ciNWff«ENCy CENTER  clothing,. and other essentials. In addition,  the voluntary agencies were reimbursed for  actual transportation costs and expenditures  incidental to travel incurred in relocating  children outside the Miami area and for the  actual cost of special services, such as psychiatric treatment or for serious illnesses requiring extensive treatment.  The Catholic Welfare Bureau and the  Children's Service Bureau, responsible respectively for Catholic and Protestant Cuban  children, not only received and placed children in Miami but also found child caring  agencies elsewhere to take Cuban children.  HIAS arranged for the out-of-Miami placements of Jewish Cuban children, and the  Jewish Family and Children's Service provided for those who were to be placed in  Miami. The voluntary agencies were responsible for the care of unaccompanied Cuban  children from the time they stepped off the  plane in Miami until foster care was no  longer needed.

Information included the whereabouts of each child and the  type of care provided until final discharge  from the program.  An unaccompanied Cuban refugee child  was defined in the contract as "a child in the  Miami impact area at the time service is  initiated, whose parent or relative cannot  provide care and supervision for him, who is  in need of foster care, and who meets the  definition of a refugee as defined by the Federal Government."  Child care facilities in States other than  Florida were needed. Since the Federal Government had assumed responsibility for the  care and protection of these Cuban children,  the usual guarantees against public dependency covered in State regulations regarding  the importation of children were not necessary. It was essential for the protection of  the children, however, that the agencies receiving them would provide an acceptable  quality of care. Therefore, only agencies  licensed or approved by the appropriate State  agency were used.  Legal custody and guardianship  Questions concerning the legal custody  and guardianship of Cuban children arose  early in the unaccompanied children's program. Because the separation from parents  was expected to be of very short duration  and because none of the children were expected to be placed for adoption, custody and  guardianship continued to reside with the  parents in Cuba.  Cuban missile crisis  The children continued to pour into the  United States until all commercial flights  from Cuba to the United States were suspended by the Castro government following  President Kennedy's public statement on  missiles in Cuba. This was in October 1962.  The peak of the Unaccompanied Cuban Refugee Children's Program was reached that  month: 4,100 children were receiving foster  care. Only a few children were able to leave  Cuba after commercial flights were suspended.  The result of this situation was that the  only commercial routes to the United States  left open were through Mexico and Spain.  Cuban refugees who escaped to these countries had to wait to be admitted to the United  States on visas. Because they arrived in  Mexico and Spain without funds and were  not allowed to seek employment while waiting  for action on their visas, many suffered severe  social and economic hardships.  In 1964, the Cuban Refugee Program,  in cooperation with the U.S. Departments of  State and Justice, devised a system that  brought Cuban parents of unaccompanied  children to the United States from Spain and  Mexico on a priority basis. As these parents  arrived, the main objective of the Cuban Refugee Program and the resettlement agencies  was to send the parents to the children rather  than to have the children return to Miami  for reunion.  Escape by sea  On September 28, 1965, Premier Castro  unexpectedly announced that any Cuban with  relatives in the United States who wished to  leave Cuba could do so after October 10.  When President Lyndon B. Johnson signed  the new immigration bill at the Statue of  Liberty on October 3, 1965, he stated that  "those who seek refuge here in America  will find it."  In early October, the Cuban government  designated Camarioca on the northern coast  of Matanzas province as an embarkation port  from which boats from the United States  could pick up refugees. Great loss of life was  averted through the tremendous effort of the  U.S. Coast Guard, which set up a line of  picket-ships covering the entire approach and  departure of the hundreds of unseaworthy  boats making the mad dash in rough seas to  and from Camarioca. Premier Castro closed  the port when the United States suggested an  orderly airlift.  4 							93065484 Bytes	4898	6332	522694577	RGB	8	600	chc02180000800007001.tif		2013-06-18	2013-06-18	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/chc0218/id/154	154	155.jp2	/chc0218/image/155.jp2
Page 8																											chc0218000080	chc02180000800008001		Many stories of heroism came out of the  small boat operation. One 16-year-old boy  made this trip from Miami to Cuba and returned with his mother and younger brother.  He proudly brought them to the Florida State  Department of Public Welfare office to meet  his former social worker who had placed him  in a foster home until arrangements were  made for him to live with an uncle. Other  equally valiant efforts of teenagers to rescue  their families ended in tragedy. About this  time, a group of Cuban boys tried to swim  from Cuban soil to safety at Guantanamo.  Eighteen made it and were flown to the  United States; the unsuccessful were ma-  chinegunned in the water.  As a result of negotiations carried on by  the Swiss Embassy in Havana, a Memorandum of Understanding between Cuba and the  United States was released by the White  House on November 6, 1965. It provided for  first priority for "immediate relatives," who  were defined as "parents of unmarried children under the age of 21, spouses, unmarried  children under the age of 21, and brothers  and sisters under the age of 21."  The United States chartered three boats  and brought 4,598 refugees to this country  during November 13-22 in "Operation Sea-  lift."  Airlift  The official airlift began on December 1,  1965, from Varadero Airport near Havana to  Miami's International Airport. During the  first month, a few parents of children living  in the United States arrived. There were complaints that priorities were not being observed. During the next months, the parents  of unaccompanied children began arriving in  greater numbers.  By April 30,1967, 62,861 Cuban refugees  had arrived by the airlift. Among these were  2,141 cases of one or both parents of 2,436  unaccompanied children under 21 years of  age. Of these children, 1,498 (from 1,203  families) were receiving either foster care  or financial assistance. The number of children in foster care under the Federal pro  gram was reduced from 1,448 children on  December 31, 1965, to 375 on April 30, 1967.  The number of minors receiving public assistance in Miami "guardian" homes was reduced from 894 to 419.  Planning for the unaccompanied child's  reunion with his parents began as soon as the  parents arrived in the United States. The  Cuban Refugee Program and the resettlement agencies developed detailed procedures  for family reunions, and these agencies continued their policy of trying to resettle the  family in the town where the child was already living.  There are moving examples of such reunions. A 17-year-old boy in foster care in  Miami had a part-time job after school. He  carefully saved his money. When his mother,  father, and little sister arrived from Cuba, 							93335920 Bytes	4906	6340	2678182632	RGB	8	600	chc02180000800008001.tif		2013-06-18	2013-06-18	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/chc0218/id/155	155	156.jp2	/chc0218/image/156.jp2

He even had linens and cooking  utensils. An 18-year-old girl was in her last  year of high school when her parents arrived.  Because her father was incurably ill and unable to work, she got a part-time job with the  neighborhood youth corps to supplement her  parents' assistance from the Cuban Refugee  Program. When she finished high school, she  went to work full-time and became the sole  support of her mother and father. The Cuban  children were excellent ambassadors. A town  in Washington was so impressed by the 35  children being cared for in that city that it  wired it would take all the parents of those  children.  When a minor unaccompanied child  arrived in Miami with the expectation of  joining a parent or relative elsewhere in the  country, the Florida State Department of  Public Welfare made the necessary clearances  with public welfare departments in other  States to assure that the child was expected  and would be cared for. After a night in a  foster home in Miami, the unaccompanied  child was taken to the airport by a caseworker, turned over to a stewardess, and was  off to join his parents whom he may not have  seen for several years.  Numbers of Cuban children cared for  In addition to the four voluntary agencies and the Florida State Department of  Public Welfare, at least 137 children's agencies participated in the Unaccompanied  Cuban Refugee Children's Program.

Estimates range from 13,000 to 15,-  000 children. Some of them were never in  agency care; a large, but unknown, number  who lived in the homes of relatives or friends  received financial assistance from the overall  Cuban Refugee Program.  There are Cuban children still in foster  care even though their parents have come to  the United States. Some of these parents have  separated from each other; some have obtained divorces. There are also the children  who did not wish to rejoin their parents after  such a long absence from them. And there  are still over 300 children in the United  States whose parents, from all indications,  may never leave Cuba.  Unaccompanied children are still arriving on the airlift. The Castro government will  not let any youth of military age (15-26  years) leave. Because some parents feel the  airlift will not enable their 14-year-old sons  to leave Cuba in time, they resort to moving  the children on commercial flights through  Spain. There are now about 150 children in  Spain for whom the voluntary agencies are  working to have them admitted to the United  States on visas.  For all of these children, the need for  care may stretch over a long period of time.  The Cuban children  The feeling of closeness that the Cuban  children seemed to have for their families  served them in good stead during their stay  in foster care. Though many miles separated  them from their parents, they still remained  a part of a closely knit family. The absent  parents, in most instances, kept close to their  children by phone and mail. In some cases,  parents continued their supervision of their  children from afar. At times, foster parents  found the children's dependence on their own  parents' guidance trying, particularly when  parents countermanded what the foster  parents were trying to accomplish with the  children.  Fortunately,  such incidents  were  few—and most of them worked out satisfactorily.  Relatively few of the children exhibited  signs of emotional stress. Most of them took  foster care in their stride. Workers anticipated all kinds of problems. For the most  part, they just did not happen.  There were, of course, some minor difficulties with the children. Many of these were  due to cultural differences. Diet was one of  the most common points of conflict arising  from the Cuban child's apparent dislike of  everything except meat, black beans, and  sugar. The foster parents' expecting them to  eat vegetables was the cause of many complaints to parents. One mother in Cuba wrote  anxiously to an institution for an explanation of her daughter's charge: "here they  feed us only spinaches." On the other hand, 							92360220 Bytes	4877	6311	695178866	RGB	8	600	chc02180000800010001.tif		2013-06-18	2013-06-18	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/chc0218/id/157	157	158.jp2	/chc0218/image/158.jp2

Among the cultural factors identified  early was the strong desire of these children  to please their parents and supervisors.  Frequent comments were made about their  politeness and conformity. One supervisor  felt, however, that with the arrivals of the  less privileged, "it was not so much a feeling  that they wanted to please, but that they had  to."  Adolescent Cubans, particularly boys,  who seemed less mature and less aggressive  '  '■^■■■: 'm lH|i  r  ^B^B^»  than American boys, appeared to accept  foster family care more readily than American boys of corresponding ages. The rate of  juvenile delinquency among Cuban youth  was negligible.  The children were sometimes described  as "their own best ambassadors." The Cuban  youngsters won friends easily. They were  well-behaved in public, good natured, law  abiding, and often very bright.  Children who were well adjusted in  Cuba adjusted well here. An exception was  young children who were not adequately prepared for separation from their parents. Most  of the older children understood that they  were here to escape Communist indoctrination and were confident that their family  would soon be reunited in the United States  if not in Cuba.  Many of the younger children did not  understand why they had to be separated  from their parents. Sometimes the parents  failed to explain to younger children for fear  of indiscreet disclosures by them to Cuban  officials. Others thought their children were  too young to understand. As the years passed  and the children had not been reunited with  their parents, some of the older children became confused, resentful, and often hostile  because of the prolonged separation.  The older Cuban child had a strong feeling of responsibility for younger brothers  and sisters. Every effort was made to keep  brothers and sisters together. In some few instances, particularly in foster family homes,  the older child's sense of responsibility for  the younger ones had negative as well as  positive results. But, in most instances, being  together was a real help in building the children's sense of security.  The matter of relationships between the  sexes represented another marked cultural  difference. The Cuban girl received the protection not only of her parents but of the  extended family; strict chaperonage until  marriage was an accepted fact of social life.  However, the Cuban girls made a good adjustment to the freedom of American dating  patterns. Very few of them became pregnant  out of wedlock. 							91621548 Bytes	4838	6311	701845061	RGB	8	600	chc02180000800011001.tif		2013-06-18	2013-06-18	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/chc0218/id/158	158	159.jp2	/chc0218/image/159.jp2
Page 12																											chc0218000080	chc02180000800012001		Some Americans were critical of the  Cubans' gregariousness, noisiness, and volubility. Some foster parents found these qualities difficult to accept and disruptive to the  household. Gradually the children took on  American ways and became more relaxed in  their new mode of life, and, in turn, the foster  parents learned to appreciate the spontaneity  and charm of the Cuban children.  While there is said to be less racial discrimination in Cuba than in this country, the  Cubans had sharper distinctions between  social classes. Children from "privileged"  families tended to ostracize the laborers', the  farmers', and the fishermen's sons and daughters. In the first days of the Unaccompanied  Cuban Refugee Children's Program, many  Cuban youth refused to perform manual  labor, especially in sight of other Cubans.  Gradually this attitude changed, particularly  after placement in other sections of the country.  The almost universal tendency of Cuban  mothers to overprotect their children was  recognized from the beginning of the program. The children were protected from  physical pain; for example, some from  affluent families had not received proper  dental care because of the pain involved, and  some were accustomed to taking a great deal  of medicine to avoid any kind of minor discomfort. It was not unusual for young Cuban  boys to take hormones, and their mothers in  Cuba would inquire as to whether the boys  were getting their medication.  Many of the youngsters came from  families with servants and had been waited  on all their lives. Some children were genuinely shocked when asked to take out the garbage or even to pick up their clothes. The  Cuban male had an exalted role in the household; helping with housework or child care  was considered unmanly.  The idea of a foster family was unknown  in Cuba. The Cuban family traditionally provided care for even distant relatives. The relatively small number of children who had  to look to strangers for care in Cuba were  provided for in institutions, usually under  religious auspices. Many of the parents of  the early arrivals had attended boarding  schools in the United States, and some of the  children, assuming they would be going to  something similar, found themselves in an  overcrowded shelter in Miami or later in a  congregate type children's institution elsewhere in the country.  Some teenagers at first resented living in  an American family. Although accustomed to  obeying adults in authority, they were slow  in recognizing the authority of their foster  parents. Often difficulties in communicating  because of language differences complicated  matters.  But children are quick to learn. In a surprisingly short time, the children were adjusting to the new way of life, learning to  communicate in English, taking part in  neighborhood, school, and community activities—and enjoying them.  The younger children, for the most part,  seemed to settle quickly in their foster parents' homes after the first few frightening  days. 							92250304 Bytes	4872	6310	389569083	RGB	8	600	chc02180000800012001.tif		2013-06-18	2013-06-18	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/chc0218/id/159	159	160.jp2	/chc0218/image/160.jp2

Foster mothers often  corresponded with the child's family. In some  instances, when the parents were finally able  to come to the United States, they were invited to stay with the foster family for a time.  Parents who followed their children to  this country usually resumed their care almost immediately. The vast majority of the  children cared for under the program have  been reunited with their parents.  When our program for these unaccompanied children will end, no one can predict.  One thing is certain. It will continue as long  as there are Cuban children who need it. Its  influence will last far beyond its ending.  Through these children, new links of understanding have been forged which will last far  into the future. This venture in good human  relationships has proved very human indeed.  10 							92701660 Bytes	4903	6301	2399063178	RGB	8	600	chc02180000800013001.tif		2013-06-18	2013-06-18	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/chc0218/id/160	160	161.jp2	/chc0218/image/161.jp2

Some  of the earliest refugees managed to bring  some resources with them.  As time passed, controls in Cuba tightened, and soon the emigres came with only  the clothes on their backs, a few changes of  undergarments, and no money. Still they  came—by commercial airlines when they  could obtain permission to leave, illegally by  small boats when they could not. And for the  first time in its history, the United States  found itself a country of first asylum.  By late 1960, it was clear that many of  the more than 30,000 refugees who were in  the Miami area were in desperate economic  straits. State and local officials, the public  schools, churches, and voluntary organizations had done a splendid job of welcoming  and aiding the refugees, but the growing  numbers had exceeded their capacity for  effective help. The Welfare Planning Council of Dade County, Florida, called a meeting  of local public and voluntary agencies in the  fall of 1960, and a Cuban Refugee Committee  was established to work with Mr. Tracy  Voorhees, Special Representative of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The resolutions  adopted by the Welfare Planning Council  recommended that the Federal Government  develop a plan to provide services for Cubap.  refugees.  In November 1960, President Eisenhower allocated $1 million out of the contingency fund of the mutual security program  for the establishment and maintenance of a  refugee center in Miami as the hub of resettlement efforts.  Recognizing that the problem was one  affecting not only Florida but the entire Nation, President John F. Kennedy in January  1961 directed Secretary of Health, Education,  and Welfare, Abraham Ribicoff, to undertake  a study of the situation and to develop a program of assistance. President Kennedy specified that Secretary Ribicoff was "to make use  of private services to the refugees to the  greatest extent possible" and "coordinate activities in this field with the Secretaries of  State, Defense, Labor, and Agriculture and  with the heads of other relevant agencies."  The program as it was developed provided:  1. Financial assistance, supplemented  by surplus commodities, to provide  food, clothing, and shelter to needy  refugees registered at the Miami  Cuban Refugee Center and who lived  in Florida or who resettled outside  Florida with the help of voluntary  agencies.  2. Financial assistance in relocating refugees to homes and jobs elsewhere in  the United States.  3. Health services and long-term hospitalization.  4. Assistance to the public schools of  Dade County, Florida, in providing  instruction to the refugee children as  well as English instruction and vocational training to adults.  5. Loans to refugee students in college  and funds for English and refresher  11 							93322836 Bytes	4924	6316	4127491979	RGB	8	600	chc02180000800014001.tif		2013-06-18	2013-06-18	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/chc0218/id/161	161	162.jp2	/chc0218/image/162.jp2

Administration and coordination of the  program was first assigned to the Commissioner of Social Security of the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.  When the Department organized a Welfare  Administration in January 1963, these responsibilities were assigned to the Commissioner of Welfare. Both the Children's  Bureau and the Cuban Refugee Program became a part of the Welfare Administration.  On August 15, 1967, the functions of the  Welfare Administration were transferred to  the newly established Social and Rehabilitation Service within the U.S. Department of  Health, Education, and Welfare.  The Cuban Refugee Program operated  the Cuban Refugee Center in Miami, where  refugees registered to become eligible for  Federally supported aid and services. Other  agencies of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare which served the refugees  were:  tion and now with the Social and Rehabilitation Service) handled the resettlement of  Cubans in other parts of the country and  overseas. These four agencies were the National Catholic Welfare Conference, the  International Rescue Committee, the Church  World Service, and the United HIAS Service.  The U.S. Employment Service in the Department of Labor handled job placements of  the refugees outside the Miami area.  The Immigration and Naturalization  Service of the U.S. Department of Justice  certified the status of the refugees.  As of April 30, 1967, 243,123 Cuban  refugees had registered at the Cuban Refugee  Center in Miami. Of these, 146,841 have been  resettled in 2,200 communities in all 50  States, the District of Columbia, Guam,  Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.  From the beginning, the Cuban refugees  were considered not as intruders but as  friends. Efforts in their behalf were regarded  not as burdens but as opportunities for service to fellow Americans, to be given with  understanding and generosity. Every effort  was made to leave the refugees free to choose  their own destiny and the place in which to  work it out.  The Public Health Service, which  screened the refugees for contagious  diseases and gave consultation with respect to other health problems.  The Office of Education, which assisted  in the development of the education  programs and administered the loan  program for Cuban college students who  would otherwise have had to interrupt  their studies.  The Florida State Department of Public  Welfare, acting as an agent of the Federal  Government, administered the distribution of  surplus commodities and financial assistance  and welfare services for Cubans.

On several occasions in the past, the  Bureau has faced the task of transplanting  uprooted children from other countries.  The Bureau first became actively concerned with refugee children's programs  early in World War II.  The Children's Bureau was a leader in  the organization, shortly after the fall of  France in May 1940, of the U.S. Committee  for the Care of European Refugee Children,  a nonprofit corporation for the purpose of  coordinating all the resources in the United  States for the care of Europe's young victims  of war.

Page 16																											chc0218000080	chc02180000800016001		Committee, 4,200 children were cared for  through the cooperative efforts of various  international, national, and local governmental and voluntary agencies. At the beginning of this program, the Children's Bureau  had responsibility for setting standards for  the care of these children and for approval  of the 233 local voluntary children's agencies  in 37 States that offered to participate in the  program.  From England alone came 861 boys and  girls, mostly between 5 and 16 years. They  were admitted to the United States in 1940  on regular temporary immigration visas. The  U.S. Committee gave assurance that no child  would become a public charge, that the children would be under continuous supervision  of the child care agencies designated by the  Children's Bureau, and that a bond of $50  would be posted as safeguard against future  emergencies. Transportation costs were paid  by the children's parents. Some children went  to the homes of friends or persons having  some business or professional relationship  with their parents; others were placed in  homes selected by the designated agencies  from among the many applicants who responded to a public appeal.  The British children were, by statute,  under the guardianship of the Crown and  were to remain here only for the duration of  the war. Most returned to England when the  war ended. Evacuation to the United States  was halted by the British Government in September 1940 after an ocean liner carrying  77 children was torpedoed.  The U.S. Committee received as quota  immigrants 454 children who had lost or had  become separated from their parents and  relatives in the trek across Europe to escape  the conquering armies in the 1940's. These  children were placed with relatives in the  United States or in foster family or adoptive  homes under the supervision of local child  care agencies.  Under the President's Directive Program of 1945, issued to facilitate the entry  of eligible displaced persons and refugees in  Europe, 1,387 children entered the United  States. The U.S. Committee submitted a blanket affidavit and assurance that a child under  18 would be in proper custody, under the  supervision of an approved agency, and not  permitted to become a public dependent. Children had to qualify for quota visas, but they  received preferential treatment.  The Displaced Persons Act in 1948 permitted the U.S. Committee to bring in 1,462  German, Austrian, Italian, and Greek children under blanket assurances. These children were under 16 years of age and had  been orphaned by death or the disappearance  of both parents.  The U.S. Committee was released from  its responsibility when children were reunited with parents or adopted, boys joined  the Army, girls married, they reached 21, or  those 18 to 21 could prove self-support.  Having fulfilled its original purpose, the  U.S. Committee was dissolved in April 1953.  Responsibility for each child remaining under  care was turned over to the cooperating national sectarian agency in accordance with  procedures accepted by the U.S. Immigration  and Naturalization Service. The master card  file with pertinent information on each child  was turned over to the Children's Bureau for  preservation in the U.S. Archives.  The work of the U.S. Committee for the  Care of European Refugee Children was originally financed through unsolicited contributions, through public appeals for funds, and  through funds of various national organizations. As the program developed, the national  voluntary agencies, representing the leading  religious groups, gradually assumed financial  responsibility for the children. The Federal  Government had no financial responsibility  for these groups of refugee children served  by the U.S. Committee.  The Refugee Relief Act of 1953, as  amended, permitted 4,000 orphans to be admitted to this country on special nonquota  immigrant visas. These children were orphans because of the death or disappearance  of both parents or if the only remaining parent was unable or unwilling to provide care  and irrevocably released the child for emigration and adoption.  After the failure of the Hungarian revolution in November 1956, the United States  experienced  the  fastest  mass  immigration  13 							91970896 Bytes	4858	6309	1079049811	RGB	8	600	chc02180000800016001.tif		2013-06-18	2013-06-18	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/chc0218/id/163	163	164.jp2	/chc0218/image/164.jp2

The first of the Hungarian  escapees reached the Joyce Kilmer Reception  Center in New Brunswick, New Jersey, on  November 23. Over 30,000 of their fellow-  countrymen followed them in the next 5  months. Two-thirds of them were under 30,  and nearly a third between the ages of 15  and 19. Of the latter, a large portion were  unaccompanied by an adult. This was especially true of the 19-year-olds, but it was also  true of some 800 to 1,000 adolescents under  18. Of the 5,300 children under 15, all but a  scattered few 13- and 14-year-olds were with  at least one parent.  Voluntary resettlement agencies working  abroad were requested by the U.S. Government to select and apportion among themselves those who were to come to this country  and to resettle those admitted. Few of the  refugees stayed within the Joyce Kilmer  Reception Center more than 2 or 3 weeks;  most of them were on their way to communities for final resettlement within 10 days.  While the President's Committee for  Hungarian Refugees offered coordinating and  expediting services to the sponsoring resettlement agencies, no standards of placement  were required or recommended by the Federal Government for the foster home placement of unaccompanied minors. This was in  marked contrast with the protections set up  by the earlier U.S. Committee for the Care  of European Refugee Children, which asked  the Children's Bureau to set standards for  child care and to approve the child care  agencies participating in the program. Children's Bureau staff, however, did provide  considerable consultation to the resettlement  agencies at the Joyce Kilmer Reception  Center. Only one of the resettlement agencies  made it a policy to inquire through a social  agency about the quality of care a relative could offer to an unaccompanied teenager. In general, State welfare departments  were not aware that unaccompanied children  were being sent into the States, nor did the  sponsoring agencies seem to be aware of the  various States' requirements concerning the  importation of children.  Similarities and differences in the  characteristics of the European refugee  children and the Cuban refugee  children  Like the English children, the Cubans  came to the United States for a temporary  period to escape hazards in their own country expecting to be reunited with their families in their homeland within a short time.  The English children came from the economically and educationally advantaged strata  of society, as did the Cuban children in the  beginning. The Cubans, the continental orphans, and the Hungarian refugees were  alike in that they spoke different languages  and came from different cultures. The continental orphans and the Hungarians came  here to make permanent homes. A majority  of both Cuban and Hungarian refugee children were teenage boys.  The English children were predominantly Protestant. The continental children  and the Hungarians represented the various  faiths in substantial numbers. The great majority of Cubans (over 90 percent) were  Catholic.  The age range of the English children  (mostly 5-16 years) and the Cuban children  (mostly 6-18 years) was roughly comparable.  One marked difference was that the English and continental children, whose expenses  were paid by the voluntary agencies, could  remain in care until age 21. The Federal  reimbursement for the care of a Cuban refugee child ceased automatically when the  child became 19 years of age.  rt u.  S.
