Miami: aerial view of downtown		Aerial view of the city of Miami showing the Ingraham Building, Alfred I. duPont Building, Security Building and the Dade County Courthouse. The Ingraham Building (1927; architects Schultze & Weaver) was originally the home of the Model Land Company, the real estate division of Henry Flagler's Florida East Coast Railroad. The duPont (1939; architects Marsh and Saxelbye) was the first skyscraper constructed in Miami after the city's economic recovery from the Great Depression. The Security Building (1926; architect Robert Greenfield) was famous for its French Second Empire-style copper-faced mansard roof, pierced by porthole windows and terminating in a domed, octagonal cupola. The Dade County Courthouse (1928; architects Ten Eyck Brown and Geiger) was the tallest building south of Baltimore when built.

Allison Hospital		Aerial view of Allison Hospital on Allison Island, 250 W 63rd Street, Miami Beach.	This three-story building was built in 1924 by August Geiger in the "Spanish Style" and it opened on January 1, 1926. It was commissioned by Indianapolis Motor Speedway founder Jim Allison (James Ashbury Allison, 1872-1928), a friend of Carl G. Fisher, who constructed it as a sort of hospital for the rich. Allison Hospital was unsuccessful, however. The Franciscans purchased it and renamed it St. Francis Hospital in 1928. Later, the hospital became a part of the Miami Heart Institute. It was demolished in 2001.
