Page 2																										CHINESE BOOKS AND LIBRARIES ·  By WALTER T. SWINGLE, Ohairman Library Oommittee, D. S. Department 01 Agriculture,  Washington, D. O.  Printing from blocks is said to have been  invented in China in 592 A. D. However,  although printing may have been invented  as early as this, printed books did not  compete with manuscripts until the middle  of the tenth century, when the printing of  the Nine Classics was completed. Possibly  periods when old precedents could be safely  broken favored the rise of revolutionary  new inventions. It is worthy of note that  the first invention of printing as well as  its final successful application took place  during unsettled periods of Chinese his ·  tory.  From the middle of the tenth century  block printing developed very rapidly, re­sulting  in a wide diffusion of books and  the decline of the copyist's trade. No doubt  the rapid dissemination of learning this en ·  tailed had much to do with the great intel­lectual  progress made in China during the  Sung dynasty, from 960- 1280 A. D., which  has been called the " protracted Augustan  age of Chinese literature." This was con ·  temporaneous with the darkest period of  the Middle Ages of Europe, when western  learning fell to its lowest ebb. Even the  conquest of China by the illiterate Mon ·  gols did not lead to the extinction of learn ·  ing. During the purely Chinese Ming dy ·  nasty, 1368- 1644 A. D., the writing and  printing of books llourished anew, while  the early Manchu emperors cultivated lit­erature  with zeal and during the reigns  of the enlightened Manchu emperors  K'ang Hsi ( 1662- 1723) and Ch'ien Lung  ( 1736- 1796) a series of great literary and  encyclopedic works that would do credit to  any country were published under imperial  patronage.  The nature of the Chinese printed Ian ·  guage is not nearly so favorable to. the use  of movable type as the vastly simpler al-  ' Paper read before the American Library Asso­ciation,  r ouisvi1le Conference. 1917. Reprinted  from the Proceedings.  phabetic tongues of the west. Still, movable  types, molded of clay, were invented in  the eleventh centur~. Even metal types  were made in Korea a half century before  they were " invented" in Europe.  Disregarding the manuscript works' of  the great T'ang dynasty ( 618- 907 A. D.),  which are dcubtless tenfold more numerous  and more important than the contempora­neous  literary works of the whole western  world, the Chinese printed books up to the  middle of the fifteehth century have no  counterpart at all in Europe. They ex­isted  in countless thousands of volumes.  In H06, the Imperial Ming Library can ·  tained printed works to' the extent of over  300,000 books, and more than twice as many  manuscripts, and already many printed  works of the Sung dynasty had been lost  during wars.  It is probably no exaggeration to say  that the number of printed books extant in  China at the time of the " discovery" of  printing in Europe exceeded those printed  in Europe during the first century after  Gutenberg. Printing became very wide-.  spread in China, and in addition to innum ·  erable privates presses, the provinces, dis­tricts  and even townships had their offi ·  cial presses. Undoubtedly more books were  printed in China than in all the rest of  the world up to the middle of the seven ·  teenth or the beginning of the eighteenth  century'.  It is thus evident that there exists in  China a vast accumulation of printed books  that have been plllng up for well- nigh a  thousand years. The pertinent question  now is, what value, if any, do these Chinese  works have? In answer to this query it  must be said, first of all, that not only are  1Even now one of the largest printing presses in  the world is to be found in China. The Commer­cial  Press at Shanghai as a part of its work prints  for the new schools of China elementary textbooks  which are often issued in editions of several  millions. 							asm01880000010002001											2009-05-18	2009-05-18	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/wtswingle/id/1	1	2.pdfpage	/wtswingle/image/2.pdfpage
Page 3																										the Chinese literary standards very high,  but there is a strong prejudice against  frivolous works of any character. The great  bulk of Chinese works, aside from the  Confucian classics, are historical 01' liter­ary,  the latter being mostly essays, short  poems or critiques. There exists also a  vast Buddhistio literature and very many  Taoist works. Novels are not even classed  as literature, although famous ones exist  and some of them have been translated into  European languages. There are also many  famous dramas, but these, too, are excluded  from literature proper by Chinese bibliog­raphers.  The historical records of the Chinese are  of vast' bulk. Their study by western  scholars cannot fail to yield results of  great value to the whole world. In close  connection with the historical records  proper we should consider the great num­ber  of geographic treatises and especially  the so- called gazetteers. These latter are  official publications issued by the Empire,  as well as by every province, district and  township and treat not only geography and  topography proper, but are often volumin­ous  works of general information, of very  direct interest today. No other country in  the world has anything to compare with  this branch of Chinese literature, either  In extent or historical value.  During the past year the writer has been  studying the citrous fruits of China. In con­nection  with this work there have been  translated chapters bearing 011 citrous  fruits from all the Chinese topographic  works available in the Library of Con­gress  and in the John Crerar Library at  Chicago. These translations have proved  the great value of the Chinese gazetteers  in modern agricultural research. With­out  doubt a great amount of valuable in­formation  as to mines, mineral resources  and local industrial products, etc., lies  waiting in these same rich storehouses of  information.  The classified encyclopedias of China,  though not so overwhelmingly superior  to those of the western countries as are the  gazetteers, are nevertheless so ancient, so  2  numerous and so voluminous as fairly to  stagger the imagination. For 750 years at  least China has had excellently edited, well  arranged and well printed encyclopedic  works of reference covering well- nigh the  whole range of human knowledge. Em­perors  vied with one another in encourag'  ing works of this character, and as a result  no people in the world have so complete a  series of encyclopedic works covering so  long a period.  One of these works, the " Yung 10 ta  tien" completed in 1409, aimed to contain  all human knOWledge then available iIi  China. The equivalent of 8,000 years'  man labor was expended on it and it  filled some 23,000 folio volumes. It proved  to be too bulky to print and was pre­served  in manuscript until 1900, when it  was burned during the Boxer ins1lfrec­tion  in Peking- a catastrophe second only  to the burning of the Alexandrian Library.  Another only less gigantic encyclopedia  is the " T'u shu chi ch'eng," printed in 1728,  in 5,026 volumes, from large movable cop­per  type. This is the largest printed book  in the world and is still today invaluable  in the study of any phase of Chinese sci­ence,  political economy or history, and II  constantly quoted by all slnologists.  Scores uPon scores of smaller encyclopedic  works, some dating back 600 years or more,  and some of the nineteenth century, are of  the utmost value to the students of things  Chinese.  China has always been proud of her  scholars, who have for ages outranked war­riors.  Over twelve hundred years ago an  examination system was devised that  placed the highest administrative offices  of the Empire within reach of the poorest  peasant's son it only he had sufficient abil ·  ity. This and the absence of any heredi­tary  nobility gave China the first efficient  civil service and the first enlightened and  pacific government. The arts and sciences  were cultivated so assiduously under this  favoring condition as to make the whole  world a heavy debtor to the great Middle  Kingdom.  As was to be expected from a nation of 							asm01880000010003001											2009-05-18	2009-05-18	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/wtswingle/id/2	2	3.pdfpage	/wtswingle/image/3.pdfpage
Page 4																										llcholars, we find in China an unrivaled  series of historical records of all state mat­ters,  and also the earliest comprehensive  biographical and bibliographical works  known. Besides this, we find every effort  made to preserve the writings of famous  scholars, usually in the form of collected  works, so that as a result there awaits the  student of almost every phase of human  activity a wealth of authentic documentary  material that has as yet been almost en­tirely  neglected.  China has been for millenniums a labora­tory  wherein political, economic, agricul­tural,  artistic and industrial experimenta­tion  has been carried on under unusually  favorable circumstances. A wealth of rna ·  terial awaits the investigator competent to  utilize these priceless records. Such inves­tigation  should be done soon, before the  Chinese become so westernized as to lose  the power of interpreting the records of  their own past. We are living in an age  that bids fair to witness the complete  transformation of the only remaining an­cient  civilization.  In China there are very few great libra­ries.  The wide diffusion of learning and  the complete decentralization of the print­Ing  and publishing industries, and most of  all the clan type of family organization,  have favored the creation of large private  or family libraries scattered all over China.  No adequate survey of the library resources  of China has ever been made, but there can  be no doubt that they are of enormous ex ·  tent.  The Chinese Imperial Court has always  maintained a large library, and sometimes  several at the various capitals, and there  has recently been established in Peking a  national library which a catalog pub­lished  in 1912 shows to be rich in rare old  Chinese books.  Japan is rich in old Chinese works treas­ured  in the private and public libraries dur­ing  the many centuries when Chinese learn­ing  was held in the highest reverence.  Doubtless the Japanese libraries rank  second only to those of China in their con­tent  of Chinese books.  In Ji, urope tnere are a few good Chinese  libraries. The oldest and best is that of  Paris, which includes a collection of an­cient  Chinese manuscripts unsurpassed  even in China. The collection at the Brit­ish  Museum ranks second. There are also  large collections at Berlin, Petrograd,  Cambridge and Leiden.  In America, the Library of Congress was  the first to secure a notable Chinese collec­tion  which now numbers close to 45,000  volumes, Chinese style. It is by far the  largest in the new world and probably  ranks second or third among the Chinese  libraries outside of China and Japan. The  collection is not only pre- eminent in geo­graphical  works and gazetteers, but als( j  in treatises on agricultural, botanical and  related subjects. It is very rich in bio­graphical  and bibliographical literature and  has a large and rapidly growing collection  of works on Chinese art and archaeology  It includes also a large number of ChinesEi  Collectanea which often contain reprints  of works no longer obtainable in the orig­inal.  The second largest Chinese collection in  America is that of the Newberry Library  in Chicago, comprising over 600 works in  about 18,000 volumes. The John Crerar  Library in Chicago also has a Chinese col ·  lection, including about 600 works In about  12,000 volumes. The two Chicago collec ·  tions so complement each other without  duplication as to constitute together a  very large and complete Chinese library of  some 30,000 volumes, rivaling or even ex­celling  that of the Library of Congress in  many fields.  The next largest Chinese library In  America is the collection donated to the  University of California, by Prof. S. C.  Kiang. It is rich in belles- lettres, contain­ing  many rare works, and comprises about  1,600 works in 13,600 volumes. Unfor­tunately  about one- fourth of the works  are more or less imperfect, as the Kiang  family library suffered greatly during the  Boxer Insurrection.  The New York Public Library contains  3 							asm01880000010004001											2009-05-18	2009-05-18	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/wtswingle/id/3	3	4.pdfpage	/wtswingle/image/4.pdfpage
Page 5																										a valuable Chinese library collected by  Dr. James Legge, the famous translator of  the Chinese classics. This special collec­tion  is very rich in the Chinese classics  and their commentaries, and contains val­uable  manuscript concordances pr, epared  by Dr. Legge in the course of his monu­mental  translations. The library of Co­lumbia  University is now cataloging its  small but select collection of Chinese  books, which it hopes to expand into a  good Chinese reference library in the near  future. The Metropolitan Museum of New  York City has a good collection of works  on Chinese art; and the libraries of Har­vard  and Yale have some very valuable Chi­nese  works, but none of these collections  are as yet complete enough to be of more  than very limited service to the student  of Chinese books.  The Library of Congress has originated  and carried through a plan of classifying  Chinese books in accordance with Ch'ien  Lung's " Imperial catalog," using modern  library notations for the various classes.  Then, too, the works reprinted in the col­lectallea,  amounting to nearly 10,000 in all,  have been entered in the catalog in the  place they would occupy In the classifica­tion  if they were separate works. No other  Chinese library has so many collectanea  rendered accessible in this way. The re­sult  is a systematic shelf list of all the  Chinese works and reprints in the library,  some 12,000 in all. A photostat reproduc­tion  of the Chinese titles has been made  up in the form of a compact small folio  volume about an inch and a half thick, in­cluding  the outline of the classification  and forming a valuable guide to the col­lection.  The hundred thousand or so volumes of  Chinese works now in American libraries  ar- e only a small part of what should be  secured in order to give any adequate Idea  of tpe stupendous intellectual activity of  the greatest and oldest nation of the  Orient. Revolutions, political reorganiza-tion,  and the progress of western educa­tion  alike threaten the literary treasures  of China. If not purchased and stored  in our fireproof and wormproof libraries  many of them will be lost forever. The  quantity of Chinese books now being  thrown on the market is so large that no  single library can hope to buy more than  a tithe of what Is offered. It would seem  wise to follow here the old adage divide et  impera. Each purchasing library, after se­curing  such general works as needed for  its own special requirements, could spe­cialize  on some one field of Chinese liter­ature  and become the leader in that  branch. By a system of Inter- library loans,  based on a union catalog, it would be pos­sible  to pool the resources of the whole  country and thus accompllsh by united  effort what singly would be Impossible.  It should be remembered that so many Chi­nese  students are attending our leading  educational institutions that it Is easy to  secure expert help in the cataloging of  Chinese books now that a workable system  has been devised by the Library of Con­gress  to classify the Chinese works merely  by looking up the titles In the " Imperial  catalog."  Now, when the Chinese problem looms  large, would seem to be a good time to  learn something at first hand about China', s  history, her present needs, and her prob­able  future development. Besides the com­mercial  traveler and the missionary, we  need another class In Chinese affairs- the  scientifically trained scholar. We need a  band of such men who shall make acces­sible  for us the wonderful storehouses of  Chinese learning available In the printed  records. The effect of adequate investiga­tions  would be to arouse general Interest  In the political, social, moral, religious and  agricultural experiences of the most sta ·  ble nation on earth. It would become ap­parent  that we have as much to learn  from China as China has to learn from us. 							asm01880000010005001											2009-05-18	2009-05-18	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/wtswingle/id/4	4	5.pdfpage	/wtswingle/image/5.pdfpage

Chinese books and libraries		Swingle, Walter T. (Walter Tennyson), 1871-1952		This article reviews the history of printing in China highlighting the vast quantity of literary works and historical records. The highlighted historical materials include many geographic treatises and gazetteers that have importance for agricultural research.  The review mentions that in contrast to the United States, the majority of Chinese literature is in large private libraries.

Page 2																										CHII ESE HISTORICAL SOURCES  THE Qinese have the longest and most continuous historical  Tecorc1s of any existing nation. Possibly the ancient Egyptians  might once have rivalled them, · but certainly no other people,  ancient or modern. From the sixth century before Christ until the  present time, historical records of unsurpassed completeness tell  the story of the greatest civilization of Asia.  01ina might very properly be called the paradise of the his­torian,  since for ages the leadership of the empire has been in:  the hands of men deeply grounded in the history of their country..  Confucius ( born B. c. 551) edited the Book of History ( Shu:  Ching), one of the five classics, covering the period from the twenty­fourth  to the eighth centuries B. C. l and himself wrote the Spring  and Autumn Annals ( Ch'un Ch'iu) , another of the five classics,  which details the principal events of his native state, Lu, from 722  to 484 B. C.  Ssu- ma Ch'ien ( born B. C. 145), the father of Chinese history  in the modern sense, wrote the Historical Record ( Shih Chi) cov­ering  the history of China from the earliest recorded times down  to 122 B. C., a period of more than three thousand years. 2 This  work has been the model for all subsequent official histories of the  Chinese dynasties', of which there are twenty- four, including the  Historical Record of Ssu- ma Ch'ien. The Dynastic Histories,  properly so called, begin with the Book of the Former Han by  1 The Book of History has been translated into English three times. The  first translation, by W. H. Medhurst, was published in Shanghai in 1846; the  second, by Dr. James Legge, was published by the Clarendon Press, Oxford,  in 1878. These two translations give also the original text in Chinese char­acters.  The third translation, by Walter G. Old, was completed in 1878. It was  reprinted later by John Lane ( New York) and Murray ( London).  There is also a French translation entitled Le ChO't-! liJ1{ J, etc., by Father  Gaubil, revised and corrected by De Guignes, and published in Paris in 1720.  Dr. Legge's translation contains in the prolegomena a translation of the  Annals of the Bamboo Books, an ancient record covering the period from the  oldest times down to B. c. 299.  2 The Shih Chi of Ssu- ma Ch'ien has been translated by the famous sinol­ogist  E. Chavannes, under the title Les Menloires Historiq1tliS de Se- ma Ts'ien,  tradnits et annotes par Edonard Chavannes, and published at Paris by  Ernest Leroux.

The last of the twenty- four official Dynastic Histories to be  issued was the Ming History ( Ming Shih) by Chang Ting- yii  covering the period from 1368 to 1643 A. D., and submitted to the  emperor in 1742, just a century after the fall of the Ming dynasty.  Five years later, in 1747, the Twenty- Four Dynastic Histories of  China were issued in an uniform series of which Professor Herbert  Giles in his History of Chinese Literature says they" show a record  such as can be produced by no other country in the world".  Several other uniform series of the Dynastic Histories were  issued before this. During the Ming dynasty the Twenty- One  Dynastic Histories were published and still may be purchased in  China.  The Twenty- Four Dynastic Histories have been reprinted in  photographic facsimile by the Commercial Press, at Shanghai,  and so are obtainable without difficulty. This reprint is bound  in 711 volumes of the Chinese style.  The Dynastic Histories are very. voluminous and are rather  historical material than · histories in the Western sense. They con­tain,  in addition to a vast number of documents, biographies of  famous men and even notices of famous books published during  each dynasty. 3  It is a noteworthy proof of the stability of the civilization of  the Chinese and their high regard for historical accuracy that  official censors have for ages commented freely on every action  of the emperor and of the great governing boards of the central  government without any fear of punishment. These censors'  3 A good idea of the character and arrangement of the matter contained in a  dynastic history is given by Bretschneider's account of the Yiian Shih or official  record of the Mongol dynasty in his Mediaeval Researches. This work, like  Yule's famous edition of Marco Polo's travels ( see full citations at the end of  this article), gives a vivid picture of life in China at the end of the thirteenth and  beginning of the fourtl! enth centuries. It should be noted that in many ways the  contacts of Europeans with China were closer during the Yiian dynasty than at  any time before or since. Regular trade routes existed between Europe and  C'ina frequented not only by merchants but by adventurers, missionaries, scholars,  ,,, 11 envoys as well. The Mongol empire covered all eastern, central, and northern  Asia and extended far into Europe; the emperors were always ready to take into  their service talented Westerners such as Marco Polo. As a result of all this the  Great Khans of Cathay loomed large in the minds of contemporary Europeans and  their fame persisted long after the downfall of the Yiian dynasty, as witness the  efforts of Columbus shortly after reaching the New \; Yorld to send envoys to the  Great Khan a full century and a quarter after the accession of the Ming emperors  - in China! 	asm0188000002						asm01880000020003001											2009-05-18	2009-05-18	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/wtswingle/id/9	9	10.pdfpage	/wtswingle/image/10.pdfpage
Page 4																										Chinese Historical Sources  records furnish a very necessary commentary on the official actIvI­ties,  and are religiously preserved for use when the dynastic his­tory  is written.  Still more interesting and significant is the fact that only after  a dynasty falls is the official history compiled. Shortly after the  fall of the Manchu ( Ch'ing) dynasty ten years ago, Chao Erh­hsiin,  former viceroy of Manchuria, was appointed official his­toriographer  of the Ch'ing dynasty. He is to- day, with a few  chief assistants and about sixty good scholars, going over the cen­sors'  records and archives as well as the printed reports of the  Manchu dynasty in order to prepare the Ch'ing Shih or Manchu  Dynastic History. It was my privilege, by invitation of Chao Erh­hsiin,  to see at Peking in October, 1918, the scholars at work on  this great . history. Hundreds of volumes of the censors' records  that formerly at the end of each year were carried off in state to  the old Manchu capital at Mukden had been brought back to  Peking and were piled on long tables. The volumes when opened  often showed strips of paper covering up some or all of the lines  or columns of characters. These strips were pasted down at the  two ends only and could be lifted up, revealing the characters  written underneath. I wa~ told that such discreetly concealed pas­sages  contained adverse criticism of the emperor or powerful  personages and were in this manner concealed from the chance  gaze of anyone accidentally seeing an open page of the book.  The last great Dynastic History to be finished, the Ming Shih,  was ordered compiled in 1679, thirty- six years after the fall of  the Ming dynasty. Fifty- eight scholars were appointed to com­pile  it. It was not finished and laid before the emperor until sixty­three  years later, in 1742. It is probable that the Dynastic History  of the Manchu dynasty now being compiled will be finished more  promptly. A t any rate it is likel, y to be the last of its kind. It  is devoutly to be hoped that the censors' records will be preserved  for posterity.' The censors have ceased to function under the  republic. The fear of the verdict of the censors and of the  dynastic history doubtless kept many a Chinese monarch fro11)  unjust and ill- considered acts.  Even the most cursory perusal of. Chinese state documents and  imperial edicts will show how powerful the pressure was to force  conformity to the supposed lessons of history. The great reformer  an~ innovator, Wang An- shih ( 1021- 1086 A.

Page 5																										W. T. Swingle  published perverfed commentaries on ancient history in order  more easily to gain credence for his doctrines.  Besides the Dynastic Histories, Chinese bibliographers recog­nize  fourteen other main classes and many subclasses ot his­torical  works. One of the most important of these classes is that  of the Annals, of wh~ ch the Spring and Autumn Classic of Con­fucius  is a model. The most comprehensive and best known of  these works is the Mirror of History, by Ssu- ma Kuang, who  lived from 1019 to 1086 A. D., during the Sung dynasty. He pub­lished  five works in all, of a very voluminous character, the main  work covering Chinese history from the beginning of the fourth  century B. C. to the middle of the tenth century A. D. The great  critic and philosopher Chu Hsi and his pupils rearranged and  condensed these works to fifty- nine books under the title Tung  Chien Kang M~ u) and published it in 1172 A. D. Many subse­quent  editions and supplements of this work, which is still con­sidered  the standard history of China, have been published. 4  Minor. historical works are almost innumerable in China and  it is no exaggeration to say that a strong historical. sense pervades  all branches of Chinese literature. As a striking example of this  may be taken the official gazetteers that have attained in China  a development unknown in other countries. China as a whole,  and every province, every prefecture, and almost every dis­trict,  has an official gazetteer. There are eighteen provinces in  China proper, abot1t 300 prefectures, and some 1700 districts.  The provincial and prefectural gazetteers are often very volumin­ous  works, and even the smallest official gazetteers, the Hsien Chih,  or district annals, often contain ten to twenty or mor'e books,  frequently bound in as many volumes.

Such gazetteers are usually rewritten every fifty or  one hundred years and some have been revised as many as ten  or twelve times. ( The gazetteer of Kiangyin district, Kiang Yin  Hsien Chih, was first published in II94 A. D., and the fifteenth  revision was issued in 1840. At least one, and possibly more addi­tional  revisions have been issued since.) These works, published  locally, are of the greatest value in any detailed work on the his­tory  of any phase of Chinese civilization.  Besides the official gazetteers of administrative regions of  various ranks, there are numerous unofficial gazetteers of moun­tains,  islands, lakes, etc. I estimate that in all probably about  2500 different regions have been covered by gazetteers and that  over IO, OOO different revisions have been published during the  past five hundred years, probably in at least 100,000 volume::..  Few people have any adequate idea · of the great volume of  Chinese printed books. Printing began in the sixth century A. D.,  but printed books did not supersede manuscripts until about the  middle of the tenth century, about five hundred years before  Gutenburg set up his printing- press. For five hundred years all  the printed books in the world, and these were many and valu­able,  were issued in China. For three centuries, from 1450 A. D.  to 1750 A. D., the books printed in China probably exceeded in  number those issued by all the rest of the world taken together,  and doubtless up to 1850 or even later more books were printed in  China than in any other country in the world.  Very many works, some of them of the highest value, have  been lost in China, and the rapid changes now in progress there  make it probable that the next few decades will witness the los~  of a large part of these books unless Western scholars awake to  a realization of their value and by exhibiting intelligent interest  in the great literary monuments of Chinese greatness bring the  new leaders of China, the students with Western education, to  appreciate more than they now do the priceless heritage of their  country's past.  The very number, variety, and bulk of the Chinese' historical  records, as well as their inaccessibility and the difficulties in  abstracting or translating them, have operated to prevent up to  now the writing of good histories of China in foreign languages.

The Newberry Library of Chicago contains a large and  well- selected collection of Chinese books on history, religion,  belles- lettres, etc. An equally large complementary collection of  Chinese books on science, industries, arts, etc:, is in the John  Crerar Library of the same city. Both collections were purchased  in China by Dr. Berthold Laufer, of the Field Museum of Chicagp.  A still larger collection is found in the Library of Congress,  where, thanks to generous donations by the Chinese government,  and to systematic purchases made by Dr. Herbert Putnam dur­ing  the last ten years, the collection is now in many fields the  best outside of the Orient and in some few probably better thaI'  any outside of China. As a whole the collection is easily one  of the two or three best to be found outside of the Orient. His­torical  works are richly represented and are being continually  added. The collection of Dynastic Histories, of Annals, and of  minor histories is very good, and the biographical works are with­out  a rival in Western cou, ntries. The collection of gazetteers is  so large that it would be noteworthy even in China, and probably  exceeds any single collection to be found outside of China.  The Library of Congress collection is particularly rich in his­torical  works and encyc10pediasprinted during the second half  of the Ming dynasty. These are of great interest because they  give the Chinese records of the advent of Europeans by the sea  route, initiated by the arrival · of the Portuguese off the coast of  South China in 1517.  Besides the great collections of Chinese books in the Library of  Congress at Washington and in the Newberry and John Crerar  libraries of Chicago, there is a large Chinese library in the Univer­sity  ofJCalifornia at Berkeley, and afair- sized one in Columbia Uni­versity,  New York City. The New York Public Library has James  Legge's Chinese library, and the American Museum of Natural  History in the same city has a small but select collection. Yale  University has a collection of Chinese works filed with the Far­Eastern  books, and the University of Pennsylvania a small col­lection  of Chinese works, but not as yet adequately indexed. The  Museum of Fine Arts at Boston has a very well- indexed collec­tion  of Chinese works on the fine arts.

China has been a great experimental laboratory in  governmental and sociological methods. Well- read Chinese  scholars can usually cite from the rich store of Chinese history  the results of carefully conducted and well- recorded trials of most  of our modern political and sociological prescriptions.  It should be said that the help of the old scholars steeped in  the lore of ancient China is indispensable to a correct understand­ing  of Chinese literature, which, because of the wealth of historical  and mythological allusions, is often difficult for a Western scholar  to read. The abolition of the old- style examination system in 1906  cut off the supply of these old scholars, so it is to be hoped that  vVestern investigators will, before it is too late, arrange to- co- oper­ate  with their Chinese colleagues in an attempt to render available  to the whole world the vast stores of human experience now  lockeq up in the literature and traditions of China.  There can be no doubt that the \ Vest has as much to learn from  China as it has to give to China. By the accident of position Amer­ica  is China's next- door neighbor- the Pacific Ocean is no longer a  barrier but rather a gateway to China. All competent observers  agree that our relations with the Far East are bound to become  increasingly important in Ehe near future. Should not then the  scholars of this country instead of being far behind their colleagues  of Europe in their knowledge of China and her neighbors, take  their proper place as the leaders in the world history of the future,  which can no longer ignore any country or any race?

SWINGLE, Physiologist in Charge, and MAUDE KELLERMAN, Botanical  Assistant, Crop Physiology and Breeding Investigations, Bureau of Plant Industry  INTRODUCTION  Missionaries and pioneer explorers of equatorial Africa long ago re­ported  the finding of wild oranges and wild lemons. If the fruits were  green, they resembled small limes and lemons; if ripe, their sweet and  agreeable flavor caused them to be classed as oranges.  These fruits are from 2 to 3 em. in diameter and are borne, two to five  or more in a cluster, in the axils of the leaves. Because of this pecuI-FIG.  1.- Citropsis Schwein/ l. rthii: A branch showing 3- foliate and s- foliate leaves, leafttke petioles, and  rachis segments; also paired and single spines In the axils of the leaves.

The petioles and  the segments of the rachis are so broadly winged that in some species  they look not unlike leaflets. ( See fig. 1.)  As early as 1870 Schweinfurth, the veteran African explorer, had col­lected  leafy twigs of one of these plants, but no flowers or fruits, in the  Journal of Agricultural Research,  Dept. of Agriculture, Washington, D.

In 1880 Soyaux collected specimens  of another species in Gabun ( French Congo). In 1882 Pogge collected  material at Lulua in Congo proper, and in 1890 Preuss found still another  very distinct species on the shores of Elephant Lake in Kamerun. Early  in 1895 Prof. Adolph Engler described four new species of Limonia to  include these plants.! In November of the same year he segregated these  Mrican species of Limonia as a new section, Citropsis, in contradistinction  to the true Limonias of the Asiatic mainland. 2  Since then several additional species have been described from tropical  Mrica, and it is now clear that these plants occur not uncommonly  throughout central Mrica from the Ivory Coast in the west to Uganda  in the east.  In connection with a study of the plants related to Citrus, these African  species of the Citropsis section of Limonia have been carefully examined.  The material of this section in the principal European collections of  Mrican plants has been studied and a number of representative speci­mens  secured, through the generosity of M. Emile de Wildeman, of  Brussels, and M. Auguste Chevalier, of Paris. Mr. B. T. Dawe, formerly  Forest Administrator of Uganda, who had discovered a new species  ( Limonia ugandensis Baker) in the forests bordering the north shore of  Victoria Nyanza, sent to the Department of Agriculture at Washington  in 19IO both good herbarium specimens and viable seed.  As a result of these investigations, which have been in progress some  three years, it is now clear that these plants have been wrongly placed  in the Asiatic genus Limonia. Instead of constituting a section of this  genus, they are in reality only remotely related to the type species from  Asia ( Limonia acidissima L.) and are, on the other hand, closely and  - clearly related to Citrus.  The Limonia acidissima ( Hesperethusa crenulata ( Roxb.) Roem.) of  India has small, globose fruits only 12 mm. or less in diameter, becoming  : a purple- black, bitterish berry when ripe. Each of the four cells of the  fruit contains a single seed surrounded with mucilage. There are no  pulp vesicles. The fruits are, thus, of an entirely different structure  from Citropsis and are like those of many Asiatic genera, such as Lavanga,  Triphasia, Severinia, etc., which constitute a natural group.  Besides the very important differences in the structure of the fruit,  Limonia acidissima differs from Citropsis in having free- spreading stamens  with slender filaments. None of the other Asiatic species usually referred  to Limonia are any more closely related to Citropsis than is Limonia  acidissima.  1 Engler. A. Diagnosen neuer Arten. In Notizbl. K. Bot.

Page 4																										Feb. 16, 1914 Citropsis, an African Genus Allied to Citrus 421  That the Mrican species of Limonia constituting the section Citropsis  are related to Citrus rather than to the Asiatic species of Limonia is a  conclusion, based at first on a study of herbarium and living material,  that has since been confirmed in gratifying manner by the results of  experiments in grafting, which show that the Mrican species belonging  to the section Citropsis can be budded easily and grow well on all the  commonly cultivated species of Citrus.  TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF CITROPSIS  It seems necessary to establish a new genus to include these Mrican  cherry oranges. This is best done by raising to generic rank the section  Citropsis of Engler.!  Citropsis ( Engler) Swing. and M. K.  The genus Citropsis resembles Citrus in the general structure and appearance of  the flowers and fruit, as well as in the texture, venation, and general type of the  leaves. It differs from Citrus in having 4- or rarely 5- merous ovaries, with only a  single ovule in each cell; fruits with sessile pulp vesicles which are broad at the bases  where they are embedded in the endocarp; the stamens only twice as numerous as  the petals; large compound leaves; and spines usually occurring in pairs. The leaves  are odd pinnate, 5- or rarely 7- foliate, trifoliate, or sometimes unifoliate, subcoriaceous,  pellucid punctate. The spines are paired or single in the axils of the leaves. The  flowers occur in few- or many- flowered axillary clusters and are perfect, 4- or rarely 5­merous.  The stamens are twice as numerous as the petals, free but flattened, and  arranged to form a staminal tube surrounding the pistil much as in Citrus. The disk  subtends and is slightly larger than the base of the ovary. The ovaries are 4- rarely  s- celled with one ovule in each cell. The style is long and deciduous; the stigma  is large, subglobose, more or less 4- rarely s- lobed. The fruit is globular or sub­globular,  small ( 2 to 3 em. in diameter), with a fleshy skin like that of a lime, dotted  with oil glands. The pulp is vesicular, either sweet and edible or waxy. The pulp  vesicles are not stalked as in Citrus, but are broad at the base where they are embedded  in the endocarpic lining of the cells and taper gradually toward the pointed tips. In  some species they are full of juice, in some they contain a waxy substance, and in  some they dry up as the fruit develops. The seeds are large, 10 by 6 by 4 mm., with  a hard, parchmentlike testa having a foramen at the tip. The cotyledons remain  hypogeous in germination. The first two foliage leaves are opposite, as in Citrus. 2  ( See fig. 2.)  1 eUropals, gen. nov.

All of this material comes from the same general locality, Johann  Albrechtshohe being only 3 or 4 km. distant from Barombi Station. All  eight of these specimens show a great resemblance and undoubtedly  belong to a single species. Unfortunately all were collected in the autumn  and show only flowers and very young fruits.  A number of other specimens have been referred to Citropsis Preussii  in the Dahlem Herbarium, but some of them certainly do not belong here,  and for the present the only material certainly referable to this species is  that collected in the immediate vicinity of Elephanten See in Kamerun.  The excellent specimens with flowers and  young fruit and numerous leaves permit a  very good idea to be gained of this species.  The leaves are 3- to 5- foliate, with broadly  winged petiole and rachis. ( See fig. 3.)  The leaflets are very large, 100 to 160 by  45 to 115 mm., broadly oval or oblong,  abruptly narrowed above into a short ob- ,:~ t,  tuse tip, and broadly cuneate at the base, ': .?  with very short petiolules. Petioles usually  69 to 80 by 25 to 35 mm., elongate, ellipti­cal,  rather acute at tip and base, but some­times  shorter and broader or even obcordate  30 to 40 by 25 mm. The segments of the  rachis are elongate elliptical, 50 to 70 by  15 to 25 mm. Spines usually single, 16 to 28 mm. long, rarely wanting.  Flowers 15 to 18 mm. long in the bud, 20 to 25 mm. in diameter when  open, in dense many- flowered clusters borne in the axils of the leaves,  very short pediceled ( 3 to 5 mm.), usually 4- merous, ovaries 12 to 15 mm.  long, with a long, slender style broadening at the base and merging  gradually into the ovary. Only young fruits are known as yet. These  are short- stalked or nearly sessile, slightly apiculate.  Citropsis Preussii is readily distinguished from its congeners by the  broadly oval or oblong leaflets, and by the short- stalked flowers with  very long styles broadened at the base and not sharply delimited from  the tip of the pointed ovaries. Citropsis mirabilis resembles this species  in the shape of the leaves, winged petioles, and rachis, but differs in the  longer stalked flowers, which have a shorter more slender style which is  not broadened at the base and consequently is more sharply delimited  from the tip of the more rounded ovary.

In 1895 Engler published Citropsis Schweinfurthii, which was based on  a single unbranched twig without flowers or fruit collected by Schwein­furth  ( No. 3656) in April, 1870, in the" Galleriewaldungen" at Dando  ( altitude 700 to 800 m.; lat. 4° 18' N., long. 28° 22' E.), about 260 km.  northeast of Albert Nyanza. The twig was originally some 33 em. long,  with 12 internodes. The basal internode, with a trifoliate leaf, was sent  to Kew Herbarium in February, 1878, where it is now preserved. The  rest of the specimen is in Prof. Schweinfurth's herbarium in the Dahlem  Museum and is the type upon which Prof. Engler based the species.  In the original description of the species the leaves are said to be trifo­liate,  but in this specimen one of them, the fifth from the tip of the twig,  is pinnately 5- foliate with a well- developed, broadly winged rachis  between the first and second pair of leaflets. One of the lateral leaflets  of the terminal pair is missing, but the shape and position of the terminal  leaflet show clearly that it was present during the life of the plant and  was probably lost after the specimen was dried, as has happened to seven  or eight leaflets belonging to other leaves of this same specimen.  The discovery of this pinnate leaf on the type specimen is of impor­tance  in justifying the reference to this species of a number of pinnate­leaved  specimens from the eastern part of equatorial Mrica.  A fruiting specimen was collected at a ferry of the Huri River about  60 km. WNW. of Albert Nyanza in latitude 2° 55' N. ( altitude 900 meters)  by Dr. F.

Natural size.  broadly winged segments of the rachis for leaflets sprouted out of each  other. 1 His specimen is preserved in the Dahlem Herbarium and has  been referred to Limonia Schweinfurthii by Engler. 2  The original label has a note by Stuhlmann to the effect that the fruit  is orangelike, light yellow in color, shows two seeds, and has a sweet pulp  without acid. A sketch on the label shows a 4- celled fruit with two seeds.  Most of the leaves are pinnately 5- foliate, though the specimen is in bad  condition and many leaflets have been lost. Both the leaves and spines  are much like those of Schweinfurth's original specimen from Uando,  and it is very probable that both belong to the same species.  Misled by the statement in the original description of this species that  the leaves are trifoliate, Baker described a new species, Limonia ugan­densis,  in 1907, which he says differs from Limonia Schweinfurthii ( known  to him only from the description) in having 5- foliate instead of 3- foliate  leaves.  The type of Limonia ugandensis was collected by Mr. A. G. Bagshawe  ( No. 1007) on April 25, 1906, at Toro, in the Mpanga Forest, to the  east of Albert Nyanza, in western  Uganda, at an altitude of 1,550  meters. The type specimen shows  flower buds and has single spines and  mostly 5- foliate leaves, but appar­ently  a few 3- foliate leaves also.  The petioles and segments of the  rachis are broadly winged and vary  from narrowly elliptical to obovate in  outline. Because of the absence of  mature flowers the description of the  stamens is erroneous in giving the filament as about equaling the anther  in length. In a fully open flower the filaments would undoubtedly be  much lon~ er. A specimen of this species which was collected by Mr.  A. G. Bagshawe ( No. 1365) at Ngusi River, Albert Edward Nyanza, at  an altitude of 970 meters, shows good fruits ( see fig. 5).  Aside from the usually but not universally broader winged petiole and  rachis segments these specimens can scarcely be distinguished from  Citropsis Schweinfurthii, and unless the flower and fruit characters prove  to be different, Limonia ugandensis will doubtless have to be considered  to be a synonym of C. Schweinfurthii.  Besides the specimens from Uganda' hitherto referred  ugandensis Baker, there are two specimens in the Dahlem  )  I" In dem dichten Unterholz fiel uns vor allem ein kleiner Busch mitdornigenAesten auf.

Brussels, ' 905-' 907 ·  collected by J. Milbraed in 1908, which seem to be referable to Citropsis  Schweinfurthii. One specimen ( No. 2394) is from Fort Beni, in extreme  western Uganda, on the Semliki River, about half way between Albert  Nyanza and Albert Edward Nyanza. This specimen consists of a single  twig with s- foliate leaves, single spines, and two young fruits. The other  ( No. 2280) is from Kikufu, near Irumu, in the Huri River valley, only a few  kilometers south of the ferry where Stuhlmann crossed the Huri and  collected his No. 2641. This second specimen of Milbraed consists of  two twigs with mostly s- foliate leaves, but one of them has a trifoliate  leaf almost exactly like those of Schweinfurth's original specimen from  Uando.  Limonia Poggei Engler, which the writers have referred doubtfully to  Citropsis Schweinfurthii, was based on a single specimen collected by Pogge  ( No. 668) June I, 1882, at Lulua, latitude 6° S., on the Lulua River, an  affiuent of the Kasai River. The type specimen preserved in the Dahlem  Herbarium shows a single twig with II or 12 internodes, but with only  one s- foliat~ leaf remaining attached. There is also one loose leaf and  a single fruit. Pogge's original label notes that the fruit is yellow. An  examination of the fruit preserved with the type specimen at Dahlem  shows it to possess distinct pulp vesicles. There is nothing in the  specimen or in the description to distinguish it from Citropsis Schwein­furthii,  and as it occurs at a considerable altitude, 660 meters, and only  500 km. west from the nearest of the great Mrican lakes, while Uando,  the type locality, was some 250 km. west, its geographic range is not  such as to render its inclusion in the species improbable.  H is interesting to note that all the reported localities of Citropsis  Schweinfurthii are above 660 meters altitude, the highest reported being  I, SSO meters at Toro, Mpanga Forest, Uganda.  There is, however, a specimen in the herbarium of the Museum  , d'Histoire Naturelle at Paris, collected by Thollon ( No. 1049) in June,  1888, in French Congo on the Niari River between BOUI\ flnza and  Komba, that can scarcely be distinguished by its leaf characters from  Citropsis Schweinfurthii. Bounanza is only 250 km. from the Atlantic  Ocean and at an altitude of only 130 meters. Thollon states on his  original label that this plant occurs in all the woods from Komba to  Bounanza. If this material proves to be Citropsis Schweinfurthii, it will  give this species the greatest range both in distance and in altitude of  any yet known in the genus Citropsis.  There is a specimen 1 in the herbarium of the botanic garden at  Brussels, collected by Messrs. Em. and M. Laurent below Ibaka, on the  Sankuru River, Congo, on November 24, 1903, and also a specimen in  the National Herbarium at Washington, D. C., collected by Messrs.  Laurent below Bolombo, on the Sankuru River, on January 2, 1904.

Both of these specimens, as well as one in the herbarium at Brussels,  collected in Congo by Messrs. Laurent in 1903- 4, but without exact  locality or date, have trifoliate leaves, long, slender leaflets, with the  terminal one disproportionately long, being 110 to 165 by 30 to 45, while  the adjacent lateral leaflets are 65 to 90 by 25 to 45; thus the terminal  leaflet is from two- fifths to one- third longer than the lateral. The only  species to which these specimens can be referred at present is Citropsis  Schweinfurthii, but in the absence of flowers and fruits and because of  the rather unusual appearance of the leaves such reference must be  merely provisional.  Citropsis Schweinfurthii is a spiny shrub or small tree with 3- to 5­foliate  leaves. The flowers are borne in clusters of 4 to 10 in the axils  of the leaves. ( See fig. 6.)  They are 4- or rarely 5­parted  with strap- shaped  petals, a short, thick style,  6 to 9 mm. long, scarcely  narrower than the stigma  but rather sharply set off  from the rounded tip of the  ovary, and broad flattened  filaments with a subulate  apex where the anther is  attached. The leaves are  pinnately 5- foliate or tri­foliate.  The petioles are  broadly winged, 40 to 75  by 18 to 35 mm., narrowly  obovate or elliptical, usu­ally  tounded at the tip  and bluntly pointed at the  base. The segments of the  rachis are 35 to 65 by 15 to 25 mm., usually elliptical, bluntly pointed at  both ends but more rounded ( sometimes rather broadly rounded) at the  tip. The leaflets, 55 to 125 by 15 to 50 mm., are broadly lanceolate,  narrowed from the middle to the long, ' cuneate base and into an acute  or subacute tip, ' with strongly marked serrations. ( See fig. 7.) The ter­minalleaflet  is often much larger than the adjacent lateral leaflets, some­times  one- third longer, usually from one- fourth to one- eighth longer. The  spines, 12 to 30 mm. long, are usually paired in the axils of the leaves.  Citropsis Schweinfurthii differs from all its congeners in having a short,  thick style ( shorter than any other species except C. gabunensis, which  has very small flowers, with a slender style) and slender, broadly  lanceolate leaflets, narrowing from the middle into a long, cuneate  acute base. 	asm0188000003						asm01880000030010001											2009-05-19	2009-05-19	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/wtswingle/id/28	28	29.pdfpage	/wtswingle/image/29.pdfpage

LAURENT ( No. ?), November 28,  1903, Bombaie ( Brussels Herbarium).  Citropsis gabunensis, one of the first four species of Limonia, described  from Mrica by Engler in 1895, was based on specimens collected by  H. Soyaux ( No. 105) at Sibanga Farm in the Munda region near Libre­ville,  French Congo ( Gabun), on July 25, 1880. Three sheets of this  number are preserved in the Dahlem Herbarium, and on them the  species is based. The type specimen had a single fruit; the paratypes  are sterile. The herbaria of Dahlem, Brussels, Paris, and Kew contain  numerous other specimens of this species from northern French Congo  and Spanish Guinea. This material represents a wide range of foliar  characters and shows all stages of flower and fruit development. All  these specimens seem to belong to a single species which is very distinct  from any of the others.  The type specimen of Limonia Lacourtiana was collected by L. Gentil  ( No. 93), May, 1893, and is preserved along with Gentil's original label  in the herbarium of the botanic garden at Brussels. The leaves are all  s- foliate, and in one case a terminal leaflet has a winged petiole. The  leaflets are broadly oval, more or less abruptly narrowed at the base,  and caudate at the tip. The young fruits are borne in clusters in the  axils of the leaves on pedicels 10 to 12 mm. long. In all of these char­acters  this specimen is indistinguishable from Citropsis gabunensis.  A young fruit from this type specimen now preserved in the National  Herbarium at Washington, D. C., seems to be seedless, but shows  numerous pulp vesicles which contain a whitish granular wax. 2 The  original label of M. Gentil says" fruits delicieux," but as the fruits in  the type specimen are very small and immature it is obvious that his  statement must apply to some other plant, doubtless not belonging to  this species. Most of the fruits of the typical Citropsis gabunensis  examined contain large seeds, often nearly filling the small fruit and  leaving very little space for the pulp vesicles, which are crowded and  often nearly obliterated by the seeds.  Whether the vesicles of a young seedless fruit of the typical Citropsis  gabunensis would show the presence of wax remains to be investigated.  In the absence of knowledge on this point it seems inadvisable to recog­nize  Limonia Lacourtiana as a species distinct from Citropsis gabunensis,  though future research may possibly prove it to be a good species.  1 This is the type specimen of Limonia Lacourtiana.  • Recently, through the kindness of M. Auguste Chevalier and of Rev. J. Gillet, of Kisantu, Congo,  abundant material has been received of a species of Citropsis apparently distinctfrom anyhitlIerto described,  tlIe fruits of which are often seedless and contain abundant pulp vesicles filled witlI a wax, which, when  extracted, makes a yellow, fragrant mass much like beeswax in character. 	asm0188000003						asm01880000030012001											2009-05-19	2009-05-19	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/wtswingle/id/30	30	31.pdfpage	/wtswingle/image/31.pdfpage
Page 13																										432 Journal of Agricultural Research Vol. I, NO. 5  Citropsis gabunensis differs from all its congeners in having very small  flowers, with hairy filaments, caudate leaflets, and a nearly dry fruit.  The flower buds are only 5 to 6 mm. long and the fully expanded flowers  are only 10 to 12 mm. in diameter. The filaments are hairy. The pistil  is very short ( 3) 1 to 4 mm.) and shows a well- marked, clavate ovary,  narrowed gradually toward the base and rounded at the tip, which is  clearly delimited from the slender style which ends in the subglobose  4- lobed stigma. ( See fig. 4.) The pedicels are very long ( sometimes  8 to 12 mm.), often twice as long as the pistil, and appear as branches  of a slender peduncle &gt; 1 to 2 em. long.  No other species of Citropsis shows so much variation in the size of  the leaves and in the number of leaflets. They may be unifoliate,  greatly resembling orange leaves, or they may have 5 to 7 leaflets.  Very frequently the leaves are 5- foliate, with the terminal leaflet borne  at the end of a winged segment of the rachis. Such stalked terminal  leaflets are often seen in trifoliate leaves ( see fig. 3) but almost never in  5- foliate leaves of other species of Citropsis. The leaflets are caudate­unlike  any of the other species.  Those of compound leaves are from 40 to 115 by 18 to 60 mm.,  mostly 50 to 100 by 25 to 45. The leaflets of unifoliate leaves are 90 to  150 by 40 to 70 mm. The winged petioles are 15 to 35 by 3 to 15 mm.,  varying from linear to narrowly obcordate, especially in unifoliate  leaves. They are usually broadly rounded at the tip and narrowed  gradually toward the base. The rachis segments vary from 20 to 45  by 4 to 10 mm. and usually have the same shape as the winged petioles.

The petioles are  usually elongate elliptical, 60 to 70 by 20 to 30 mm., rather acute at  both ends, rarely broadly rounded at the tip.

The specimen in the Willdenow Herbarium at Dahlem, of which a  photograph was kindly sent to the writers by Prof. Urban, now shows a  single twig, 21 em. long and 2;{ to 4;{ mm. in diameter, with 10 or II  internodes which are mostly 2 to 2;{ em. long, slightly angular, with  prominent leaf scars. Only two single spines are preserved, one 8 by I  mm., the other 14 by I~ mm. Two petioles are on the sheet: One, still  attached, obovate in outline, 52 by 32 mm. tapering gradually into the  sharp base 4 to 5 mm. long; the other broadly rounded at tip, 60 by 37 mm.  with prominent veins, running nearly at right angles to the midrib, the mar­gin  very shallowly undulate crenate. It is evident that the Isert specimen  at Dahlem was more complete when Sprengel published Willdenow's  description, as the leaves are said to be oblong and the peduncle many­flowered.  Probably only a single terminal leaflet was originally present.  The many- flowered peduncle seems also to have fallen off since Willde­now's  time, as none can now be seen on the photograph.  To this species has been doubtfully referred a specimen from Togo­land  collected by E. Baumann ( No. 552), on May 16, 1895, on the Koli  River near Kame, probably not very remote from the locality where  Isert's type was collected. The Baumann specimen has 3- to 5- foliate  leaves, with petioles varying somewhat in size and shape, 35 by 13,  60 by 25, 32 by 50, 40 by 18, or 30 by 20 mm. Curiously enough, the  terminal portion of the twig, including the last five or six internodes,  has lost its leaves except one obovate petiole. It has three single spines  and in general resembles in a striking manner Isert's specimen, upon  which Willdenow based his species. Another curious coincidence is in  the presence of the terminal leaflet of an originally trifoliate leaf from  which the two lateral leaflets have fallen. It was probably from such  an apparently unifoliate leaf originally present on Isert's specimen that  1 Isert found this plant in the mountains some 50 to 7S km. north of Accra and says of it: U Ie vis une  nouvelle espece de citroniers, avec des feuilles articulees."

Page 15																										434 Journal ot Agricultural Research Vol. I. NO. 5  Willdenow described the leaves as oblong. This Baumann specimen  shows an axillary inflorescence comprising some 6 to 8 flowers with  slender ovaries ( 10 to II mm.) and very slender styles somewhat like  Citropsis mirabilis. The leaves of the Baumann specimen have more  broadly winged petioles than the C. mirabilis, and doubtless because of  this it was referred in th€ Dahlem collection to C. Preussii, from which it  differs in the distinctly shorter, more slender style, the narrow smaller  leaflets, and the broadly rounded tips of the winged petioles and seg­ments  of the rachis. The flowers in the Baumann specimen are more  densely clustered and shorter pediceled than in C. mirabilis.  It is to be hoped that more complete material collected by Isert may  be found in the Copenhagen Herbarium which will permit the affinities  of this species, the first of the group to be discovered, to be determined  with exactitude.  Besides the foregoing, there remain two more Mrican species of  Limonia which undoubtedly belong to Citropsis, but which can not as  yet be satisfactorily placed because of insufficient material. These are  Limonia Poggei, var. latialata De Wild., doubtless distinct from L. Poggei,  and Limonia Demeusei De Wild. Both have been described and beauti­fully  figured. 1  In addition to the material cited, specimens are to be found in the  various European herbaria and in the National Herbarium at Washing­ton,  D. C., which it has been impossible to place, owing to the lack of  flowers or fruits. This additional material represents collections, prin­cipally  from Congo, by Auguste Chevalier, Em. and M. Laurent, Demeuse,  L. Gentil, and others.  POSSIBLE USES OF THE AFRICAN CHERRY ORANGES  The bringing to light of a new genus belonging to the true- orange group  opens up a new field for the plant breeder, especially as some of the  species are said to bear delicious fruits in abundance.  The unusually large compound leaves- Dften with five leaflets, each  one of them larger than any ordinary orange leaf- give several of the  species of Citropsis a distinct advantage over any other member of the  true orange group. Large leaves are an outward and visible sign of an  active assimilating system, and it must not be forgotten that over three­fourths  of the dry substance of a plant is made up of starch, sugar, oil,  flavoring matter, and other substances manufactured in the leaves, and a  species with large leaves is equipped with the first essential for rapid  growth and for developing sweet fruits of high flavor. .  l" Wildeman. tmile de. ttudessurla Flore du Bas- et du Moyen- Congo.

Page 16																										Feb. 16, 1914 Citropsis, an African Genus Allied to Citrus  GRAFTING OF CITROPSIS  435  Experiments conducted under the directions of the authors in the  greenhouses of the Department of Agriculture at Washington, D. C., show  that Citropsis Schweinjurthii can be grafted readily and that it will grow  rapidly and vigorously on sweet orange, sour orange, grapefruit, and  lemon stocks. It can also be grafted on the tabog ( Chaetospermum gluti­nosa)  and the wood- apple ( Feronia elephantum) , two stocks on which  species of Citrus graft readily. However, it does not grow as vigorously  on these stocks as on Citrus. The very rapid growth of Citropsis when  grafted on Citrus ( see PI. XLIX) is an added and striking proof of the close  affinity of these two genera. Additional experiments in budding and  grafting on other genera related to Citrus are now under way.  In view of the considerable botanical differences between Citrus and  Citropsis, it is probable that the latter will show immunity to diseases and  adaptations to soil and climatic conditions not possessed by the 5tocks  upon which citrous fruits are commonly grafted. Experiments conducted  by the authors have already indicated that Citropsis Schweinjurthii is well  adapted to poor, sandy soils (" high pine lands" ) in Florida. Every new  stock well adapted to Citrus gives the grower and the pathologist a new  tool in the work of perfecting the culture of citrous fruits and in prevent­ing  the ravages of diseases by using stocks which are immune. The  scarcity of material of the African cherry oranges has hitherto prevented  any extensive experiments in the use of this new stock, but grapefruit  and oranges have both been budded successfully on Citi'opsis stocks in  the greenhouse at Washington and out of doors in Florida.  HYBRIDIZATION OF CITROPSIS  The fact that there are a number of closely allied yet distinct species  of Citropsis native to the forests of tropical Africa is an advantage to the  plant breeder in furnishing material for the improvement of the African  cherry oranges by hybridization. Whether the waxy- fruited species will  yield edible hybrids when crossed with the juicy- fruited species can only  be told by experiment.  So far, the scarcity of flowers of the African cherry oranges has pre­vented  any decisive test as to whether they can be crossed with species  of Citrus or not. This much can be said, that flowers of the common  lime, Citnls aurantijolia ( Christm.) Swing., pollinated with Citropsis  Schweinjurthii set fruit and produced seed. Only a few seed were se­cured  and none of them gave rise to a hybrid, but this is not uncommon  in Citrus. The fact that the pollen of Citropsis was able to cause the  development of seeds is a very hopeful sign that hybrids will be secured  from pollinations in the course of the breeding experiments now being  carried on by using the pollen of Citropsis on as many species of Citrus  as possible. 	asm0188000003		asm01880000030016001															2009-05-19	2009-05-19	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/wtswingle/id/34	34	35.pdfpage	/wtswingle/image/35.pdfpage
Page 17																										Journal oj Agricultural Research Vol. I, No. 5  That hybrids of the common citrous fruits with the African cherry  oranges would be promising table fruits is rendered probable by the fact  that both Citrus and Citropsis have species which in a wild state yield  fruits beautiful to tqe eye, fragrant, and delicious to the taste.  Because of their beautiful foliage, their very fragrant, large white  flowers, much resembling those of the orange or lime, and their abundant,  though small, fruits, borne in tufts like cherries, the African cherry  oranges are of unusual promise for ornamentals and for hedge plants in  subtropical regions.  The fact that the true relationships of so large and, so striking a group  of plants, ranging clear across equatorial Africa, could remain misunder­stood  by botanists for so long a time, is another proof of the rich harvest  of new material which awaits the attention of the plant breeder as soon  as a critical taxonomic study of the wild relatives of our principal cul­tivated  plants makes it available for his use.

Citropsis, a new tropical African genus allied to citrus		Swingle, Walter T. (Walter Tennyson), 1871-1952; Kellerman, Maude		Swingle describes the new genus Citropsis, also known as the African cherry orange, whose fruit resembles lemons and oranges. The plant is common throughout central Africa from the Ivory Coast to Uganda. Citropsis is a member of the family Rutaceae and is closely related to Citrus. As a plant breeder, Swingle is interested in finding Citropsis species that will provide delicious fruit and be resistant to disease. He reviews experiments grafting Citropisis to Citrus and hybridization work with Citropsis.	Reprint:  Swingle, Walter T. and Maude Kellerman. 1914. Journal of Agricultural Research. 1(5): 419-436.

SWINGLE,  PHYSIOLOGIST IN CIIARGE OF CROP PHYSIOLOGY AND  BREEDING INVESTIGATIONS.  WASHINGTON: GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFiCE: 1900  B. P. 1.- 531.  THE LIMITATION OF THE SATSUMA ORANGE TO  TRIFOLIATE- ORANGE STOCK. a  INTRODUCTION.  The Satsuma orange is a variety which has come to be widely  grown in the warmer parts of the Gulf States. Without entering  into a discussion as to the merits and demerits of this variety, it is  proposed in this circular to call attention to the fact that unlike most  commonly grown varieties it succeeds only when grafted on Trifoliate­orange  stock and is a complete failure on the sour- orange stock upon  which almost all other citrus fruits can be grown successfully.  In view of the fact that large experimental and even commercial  plantings of the Satsuma orange are being made in nearly all of the  Gulf States and that Satsuma trees are being oiTered for sale on sour­orange  stock, it is considered advisable to call attention to the certain  failure which will result from planting Satsuma oranges budded on  sour stock. . Fortunately a simple method has been discovered for  identifying with certainty Trifoliate stock, which makes it easy to  guard against the fradulent substitution of sour- orange or any other  stock for the Trifoliate.  HISTORY OF THE TRIFOLIATE ORANGE IN THIS COUNTRY.  Growers of citrus fruits in this country have long been accustomed  to use the sour orange and the sweet orange as stocks, while in recent  years the rough lemon and to a lesser extent the grapefruit have come  into use. These show widely dillerent adaptation to soil conditions,  as well as greatly varying powers of disease resistance.  Among the stocks which have come into prominence during the  past few dec:: tdes is the hardy Trifoliate orange of China and Japan.  a During the last few years there have been extensive plantings of the Satsuma  orange in the warmer parts of the Gulf States. Without entering into a discussion  as to the value of this variety and the prospects for growing and marketing it success­fully  on a commercial scale, Mr. Swingle wishes to call attention in the present cir­cular  to the unusually sharp limitations of this variety to a single stock- the Trifoliate  orange. It is believed to be desirable to warn all who desire to test the variety against  purchasing trees budded on the sour orange, a stock remarkably well adapted to almost  all other kinds of citrus fruits, but which Mr. Swingle finds to fail entirely for this  particular variety.  A simple method for distinguishing the Trifoliate orange from all other stocks is  pointed out, rendering it easy to protect purchasers of Satsuma oranges against the  substitution of sour- orange for Trifoliate stock.- B. T. GALLOWAY, Chief of Bureau.  ~~ 3  LIMITATION OF SATSUMA ORANGE. 5  This was introduced into this country by the Department of Agri­culture  in 1869 and was at first little more than a botanical curiosity.  It was soon found to be an excellent hedge plant in the South, and  even as far north as \ Vashington, D. C., and for many' years it was  grown for this purpose. The fact that it is able to withstand without  injury temperatures as low as zero Fahrenheit, or even lower, makes  it suitable for culture over nearly half the area of the United States.  Those forms of the Trifoliate orange which have fully developed  flowers are handsome ornamentals, especially when they blossom in  the spring and again when laden with fragrant yellow fruit in the  autumn. Unfortunately many of the Trifoliate orange trees grown  in this country do not develop their flowers perfectly, or, at least, not  all of their flowers, the petals being stunted and shortened by gland­like  growths on the edges near the base. The flowers are shown  natural size in Plat" e 1. A fruiting branch is shown in figure 1, and  fruits in cross section and in longitudinal section in figures 2 and 3.  FIG. 2.- Cross section of a fruit of the  Trifoliate orange.  ( Natural size.)  FIG. 3.- Longitndinal section of a  frui t of the Trifoliate orange.  ( Natural size.)  It would be very easy, however, to breed up a large- flowered race of  the Trifoliate orange that could be propagated very rapidly and  cheaply from the superabundant seeds that fill the fruits.  The Trifoliate orange has been used for ages in China and Japan as  a stock upon which to bud the cultivated citrus fruits, and about the  middle of the last century it was brought to notice in England as a  stock for the kumquat. This latter species itself was, however,  only a curiosity, and apparently very few experiments were made in  Europe with the Trifoliate orange as a stock for oranges, lemons, and  other common citrus fruits.  About a quarter of a century ago the Trifoliate orange began to be  used in this country as a stock for the Satsuma orange, as well as for  other citrus fruits. It was found that all grow well on this stock, and  that it had a tendency to force early and profuse bearing, at the  same time dwarfing the tree somewhat.  [ Cir. 46]  6 LIMITATION OF SATSUMA ORANGE.  Although the Trifoliate is naturally a small tree and of slow  growth, when used as a stock its growth is so stimulated that its  diameter always continues greater than that of the scion. This  disparity in size, while not sufficient to make the union a poor one,  makes it easy in walking through a grove of citrus fruits budded on  , this stock to detect the point of union of the scion with the stock  because of the abrupt increase in diameter of the latter. a  The Trifoliate- orange stock has one disadvantage in comparison  with sour- orange, sweet- orange, and other commonly used stocks­it  does not sprout readily from the root if the top is killed by a  severe frost. For this reason varieties grafted on Trifoliate roots and  grown where there is danger of occasional severe fr6ezes should always  be earthed up a few inches above the point of insertion of the bud, so  that in case the top is killed by a severe freeze the budded variety can  be reproduced by sprouts issuing from that part of the trunk which  is protected by the earth. If this precaution is neglected there is  danger of orange trees grafted on Trifoliate stock being killed out­right,  root b and branch, by an unusually severe winter.  THE KUMQUAT SUCCEEDS BEST ON TRIFOLIATE- ORANGE STOCK.  There are very few varieties of citrus fruits that do not succeed on  the Trifoliate stock, provided, always, the soil is adapted to the stock.  Some varieties succeed better on this stock than on any other. Per­haps  the most striking example of this is the kumquat, which is the  hardiest of the evergreen citrus fruits. On Trifoliate stock it bears  heavy crops of fruit while stili a mere bush.  On the other hand, the kumquat is not adapted for budding on sour��orange  stock, and such buds often fail to grow, or even die, after they  have started to push, something very rare among citrus fruits. c  THE SATSUMA ORANGE A FAILURE ON SOUR- ORANGE STOCK.  Another variety of citrus fruits that behaves very differently on  the various stocks is the Satsuma, a very early orange of the mandarin  class introduced from Japan, where it is known as the Unshiu. This  variety, which is the earliest and at the same time one of the hardiest  a This form of union wherein the stock slightly outgrows the scion has been noticed  also in the case of the loquat grafted on the quince growing at Eustis, Fla. In this  case, also, the variety so grafted began to bear when still very young and has borne  abundant crops since. It is interesting to note that in both of these cases we have a  large- leaved evergreen plant grafted on a small- leaved deciduous and not very closely  related species. The contrary union, where the scion outgrows decidedly the stock,  is apparently not satisfactory, the scion being likely to break off and being usually  short lived, even when it escapes being broken off.  b The Trifoliate root, strictly speaking, is not killed outright, but as it produces no  sprouts it soon dies from starvation.  c For these facts the writer is indebted to 1Ir.

LIMITATION OF SATSUMA ORANGE. 7  of the oranges, a grows very well on sweet- orange stock- better, in  fact, than on the Trifoliate orange on most soils- but the fruit is of  decidedly inferior quality on the former stock, being coarse, dry, and  insipid, besides ripening later than on the Trifoliate stock.  On the sour orange the Satsuma is a complete failure, the growth  being so slow and stunted that it never becomes more than a dwarfed  bush. The fruit that is borne by this stunted top is of very inferior  quality. There is every evidence of a considerable degree of incom­patibility  between the Satsuma and the sour orange. It is no exag­geration  to say that he who plants a Satsuma orange tree grafted on  sour stock might better bury a five- dollar bill and burn the tree,  which, if planted, will linger along for years, only to be finally dug up  as worthless. Inquiry among growers of Satsuma oranges in Florida,  Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, and northern Mexico has  failed to elicit a single instance of successful growth and satisfactory  fruiting of this variety budded on sour- orange stock. The writer  was stationed for five years in Florida investigating citrus fruits in  all parts of the State, and during that time he never saw a vigorous  Satsuma tree or any good crops of early- ripening fine- flavored Sat­suma  oranges borne on trees budded on sour- orange stock.  THE SATSUMA ORANGE BEST ADApTED TO TRIFOLIATE- ORANGE  STOCK.  On the other hand, the Satsuma budded on the Trifoliate orange  produces fruits which ripen early and are of excellent quality, smooth  skinned, firm, and juicy. The trees budded on this stock are smaller  than those budded on sweet- orange stock, but they bear earlier and  fruit more profusely. They also ripen their fruits earlier in the  season and are decidedly hardier.  The Satsuma orange is the only one of the commonly grown citrus  fruits ( besides the kumquat) which shows such marked differences  in growth and character of fruit when budded on different stocks.  Since the Satsuma orange can succeed on but one stock, the Tri­foliate  orange, it can be grown with hope of commercial success only  on soils to which the Trifoliate stock is adapted, namely, on fairly  rich, somewhat moist soils, preferably sandy soils with a clay subsoil.  It is almost impossible to successfully grow orange trees budded  upon Trifoliate stock on light, sandy soils such as make up the bulk  of the soil of southern Florida and parts of southern Texas.  a Growth ceases at an early period in autumn, and, when once the last growth has  hardened, the tree can endure a considerable spell of very warm weather without being  forced into growth. This high degree of winter dormancy is what renders the Satsuma  so well adapted for culture in the variable climate of the Gulf States. As to the quality  of. the fruit of the Satsuma, there are wide differences of opinion. This is due ill large  part to its greatly varying quality, depending on the stock upon which it is budded  and on the soil and climate of the locality where it is grown.

( Drawn  by Dr. Theo.  lIolm.)  In 1887, Prof. Otto Penzig, director of the botanic  garden at Genoa, Italy, published a very interesting  account of citrus fruits for the Department of Agri­culture,  Industry, and Commerce  of the Italian Government. In the  course of his investigations of the  anatomy of the principal types  of citrus fruits, he discovered a  striking difference in the structure  of the pith of the Trifoliate orange  as compared with that of other  citrus fruits. b  If a section be made lengthwise  of a stem or twig of the Trifoliate  orange, the pith is found to con-tain  rows of cells arranged so as to  form more or less imperfect partitions some­what  like the partitions in the pith of the wal­nut.  Such a section of the Trifoliate orange  showing the cross plates of thick- walled cells  in the pith is shown in figure 4 to be contrasted  with figure 5, showing the absence of any such  plates in the pith of the sour orange. A few of the thick- walled  cells which make up the imperfect longitudinal cross partitions of the  Trifoliate orange are shown under higher magnification in figure 6.  In case the soil is not adapted to the Trifoliate orange, there is  little hope of growing the Satsuma orange successfully unless some  new stock not as yet known is found adapted to this  variety and able to grow on light soils. As a last  resort, grapefruit, citrange, a or some other stock could  be tested, but it is useless to set out trees of this variety  grafted on sour- orange stocks.  a The citrange is a hardy citrus fruit originated by the Department of Agriculture  by crossing the common orange and the Trifoliate orange. Citranges grow more vigor­ously  than either parent, and some varieties can be reproduced practically unchanged  from the numerous seeds. Because of their vigor and their being half orange, cit­ranges  can be expected to thrive in soils too light for the straight Trifoliate. As the  Satsuma orange grows rapidly on sweet- orange stock and fruits well on Trifoliate  stock, it would probably succeed on the citrange, a hybrid of these two stocks.  b Penzig, O.

[ Oir. 46]  LIMITATION OF SATSUMA ORANGE. 9  A longitudinal section of the pith of the sour orange is shown in  figure 5. It will be noted that there is an entire absence of Cross  partitions, and there are no thick walls to be seen. All of the ordi­nary  types of citrus fruits, including  the sour orange and all that are  ever used as stocks in this country,  have pith of this character without  any trace of cross partitions built up  out of thick- walled Gells.  These peculiar cells are of such a  striking character as to make it easy,  by using a low- power microscope, to  distinguish between Trifoliate and  sour orange stocks- in fact, to dis­tinguish  Trifoliate- orange from any  other citrus stock- with absolute cer­tainty.  To make such an examina­tion  it is of course necessary to take FIG. 6.- A small group of thick- walled cells  from the pith of the Trifoliale orange.

In the case of nursery stock this Holm.)  can even be done, if desired, without killing the plant, since a cut  extending half way through- necessary to take out the pith- will  soon heal up.  WARNING AGAINST THE PURCHASE OF SATSUMA ORANGES ON  SOUR- ORANGE STOCKS.  In spite of the fact that Satsuma oranges budded on sour- orang~  stock are known to be a total failure, some nurserymen have budded  them largely on this stock and are even offering them for sale on  the ground that the Trifoliate stock does Dot succeed on light, sandy  soil, whereas sour- orange stock does succeed in such situations. All  this is perfectly true, but no mention is made of the additional and  very important qualification that the Satsuma orange budded Oll  sour- orange stoek is perfectly worthless from a commercial point of  view on any soil.  In view of these facts, this occasion is taken to urge intending  purchasers of Satsuma oranges to insist that they be budded on  Trifoliate- orange stock. In no case should they be accepted on  sour- orange stock. If the experiment is to be made of growing  Satsuma oranges in a region where the soil is light, especially in  southern Florida and southern Texas, it may be worth while to experi­ment  with the Satsnma on certain other stocks, such as grapefruit  or seedling citrange, but there is little hope for financial success in  growing Satsuma oranges in such situations.  [ Clr. 46)  10 LIMITATION OF SATSUMA ORANGE.  In order to make it possible for orange growers to be sure that  they are getting plants grafted on Trifoliate- orange stock, the De­partment  of Agriculture will undertake temporarily to determine,  free of charge, whether or not nursery stock of citrus fruits is grafted  on Trifoliate- orange stock. It is hoped that this method will be  adopted by state horticultural inspectors and by state experiment  stations, as well as by growers themselves. It is the purpose of this  temporary offer of the Department to maJm known the possibility  of distinguishing readily whether or not the stock used is the Tri­foliate  orange.  SUMMARY.  It is not the purpose of this circular to discuss the merits or demerits  of the Satsuma orange or to attempt to define the regions in which  it can be grown with reasonable hope of success.  The Satsuma orange is almost a complete failure on sour- orange  stock on any soil and in any climate, and succeeds well only when  budded on Trifoliate- orange stock. It can . be grown, but less suc­cessfully,  on sweet- orange, grapefruit, and perhaps rough- lemon  stocks.  The Satsuma orange, being limited to the Trifoliate- orange stock,  can be grown with reasonable hope of success only on soils to which  this stock is well adapted, namely, fairly rich, fairly heavy soils,  preferably with a clay subsoil.  Purchasers of Satsuma orange trees should insist that they be  grafted on Trifoliate- orange stock, ano to protect purchasers against  substitution of trees grafted on sour- orange stock the Department  of Agriculture will undertake for the present to determine whether  or not the stock is Trifoliate orange. .  Do not buy Satsuma oranges budded on sour- orange stock! If you  suspect substitution, send a sample to the Department of Agriculture  for determination.

SWINGLE  With four plates  THE PRESENT paper adds one new genus and several new species to  the Orange subfamily AURANTIOIDEAE of which I am preparing a synop­sis  to be published shortly. This paper supplements the one that I  published in this JOURNAL last April.'  Some seventy- five years ago ( about 1862) a curious plant was dis­covered  by J. E. Teysmann, a well known botanical collector, growing  near the seashore at Rembang on the north shore of the island of Java.  In 1864 this plant was published as a new species by F. A. W. Miquel  and placed doubtfully in the genus Paramignya ( P. ? littoralis). The  discoverers of the plant, J. E. Teysmann and S. Binnendijk, published  also in 1864 additional notes based on Teysmann's observations.  Herbarium specimens of the type material were sent to the ational  Herbarium ( Rijks Herbarium) at Leiden, Holland, and to the Botanical  Garden at Buitenzorg in Java. This plant then disappeared from notice  for nearly half a century. In 1912 Valeton published a lithographic plate  of this species based on the original type material deposited in the  herbarium at Buitenzorg. The plant was rediscovered at about this  time in Annam, French Indo- China, at Nha- trang and a few years later  to the north at Tourane near the seashore.  Thanks to the loan of Miquel's type specimen from the Rijks Herba­rium  at Leiden and excellent material from Indo- China found in several  ' Swingle, Walter T., Clymenia and Burkillanthus, new genera also three new  species of Pleiospermium ( in Jour.

As a result of these studies, I find that this little known plant, vari­ously  classed in the genera Paramigyna, Limonia, Atalantia and Pleio­spermium  by leading taxonomic botanists familiar with the genera of  Rutaceae, cannot be placed in any of these genera, but is the type of a  new genus for which I propose the name Limnocitrus. 2  Limnocitrus, gen. nov.

Limnocitrus  has a cup- shaped disk, and a relatively very large calyx expanded by the  petals which are thickened toward the base and reflexed at the tips in  anthesis. The ovary is most unusual in having numerous ( 12- 20)  longitudinal furrows with narrow ridges between, bearing numerous long,  white bristles ( Plate 1, figures 2, 6).  The fruits, which resemble small oranges, have the locules filled with  long slender pulp- vesicles that taper to an acute apex and are more or  less bluntly contracted where they are attached to the dorsal walls of  the locules ( Plate 1, figures 4, 5). The characters shown by these pulp­vesicles  clearly distinguish Limnocitrus from the other related genera  which I place in the subtribe Citrinae of the tribe Citreae .. Limnocitrus  and the genera most clearly related to it, Severinia, Pleiospermium,  Burkillanthus and Hesperethusa, constitute a group which I have called  Primitive Citrus Fruit Trees. 1  The pu: p- vesicles of Limnocitrus are somewhat intermediate in char­acter  between those of Pleiospermium and those of the True Citrus Fruit  Trees such as Citrus and closely related genera. The fruits of Limno­citrus  were described by A. Guillaumin ( in Bull. Soc. Bot. France, 60:  442. 1913), in translation as follows: " The fruits, as a matter of fact,  resemble small oranges about 4 em. in diameter, with 5 locules almost  completely occupied by the 2 very large seeds surrounded by succulent  hairs as in the genus Citrus and in Atalantia citroides."  Although Limnocitrus is apparently a connecting link between The  Primitive Citrus Fruit Trees, such as Pleiospermium, and the True  Citrus Fruit Trees such as Microcitrus, it must be kept in mind that  Limnocitrus shows striking characters in the ovary with its numerous  longitudinal furrows separating low ridges which carry lines of long,  white bristly hairs - characters not found in any other genus of the  tribe Citreae or even in any of the whole subfamily AURANTIOIDEAE.

Limnocitrus littoralis is a striking plant because of its thick, veiny  leaves, rigid, straight thorns, abundant clusters of greenish white flowers  and fruits that look like small oranges. It is called kim do um by the  natives at Nha- trang, Annam, and doubtless because of this is not diffi­cult  to find in this locality.  Because of its habitat, in tidal marshes subject to recurrent inunda­tions  at spring tides, this plant is almost certain to possess a rather high  tolerance to salinity in the soil moisture. Citrus can be grafted on  Merope angulata,' another salt- tolerant Citrus relative, but so far has  made only unsatisfactory growth on this stock. However, Limnocitrus  littoralis is undoubtedly much more closely related to Citrus than is  " Swingle, Walter T., Merope angulata, a salt- tolerant plant related to Citrus,  from the Malay Archipelago ( in Jour.

E. Australia is salt- and boron- tolerant and supports Citrus  well when used as a rootstock.  As Limnocitrus is easily obtainable, it should be introduced into cul­ture  and tested as a root stock for Citrus.  THE GENUS WENZELIA  Some 25 years ago Dr. E. D. Merrill founded a new genus, Wenzelia,  on a single new species, W. brevipes, discovered in Leyte, one of the  southern islands of the Philippines. In 1928 Ty6zabur6 Tanaka trans­ferred  Citrus paludosa Lauterbach and C. dolichophylla Lauterbach &  K. Schumann, to the genus Wenzelia. In 1938 I also transferred Citrus  grandifiora Lauterbach to Wenzelia. Unfortunately these three species,  all native to New Guinea, were, and still are, only imperfectly known  and it may prove difficult to secure additional and better material of  them from this vast and still only very inadequately explored island.  It is a great pleasure to be able to add to this genus no fewer than five  new species, all of them better known than any of the old species except  Merrill's type species, Wenzelia brevipes. I discovered three of the five  new species in herbarium specimens sent to me for study by Dr. Merrill  from the rapidly growing collections of the Arnold Arboretum. Dr.  1errill also called to my attention the curious tree discovered by Dr.  A. C. Smith in the Fiji Archipelago that proved to be another new  species of Wenzelia. The type specimen has been lent to me by the  New York Botanical Garden.  Finally I am naming, with some hesitation, a new variety of Wenzelia  brevipes, found on Alabat Island in the Philippines. Thanks to these  new discoveries Wenzelia is now the largest genus in the southeastern  part of the range of the Orange subfamily, from the southern islands of  the Philippines to New Guinea, the Solomons and Fiji Archipelago.  It also appears that among the six well- known species of Wenzelia  there are two well- marked groups of species characterized by two very  different types of seeds. One group, typified by the type species of the  genus, Wenzelia brevipes, has only a few large thick seeds; the other  group, not known until I discovered two new species from New Guinea  and one from the Solomons, has many seeds ( sometimes as many as 30  in a single fruit) which are flattened and often more or less curved or  lSwingle, Walter T., Eremocitrus, a new genus of hardy drouth- resistant  Citrus fruits from Australia ( in Jour.

These flat- seeded species of Wenzelia are  obviously related to the curious Monanthocitrus cornuta, native to south­western  New Guinea. This latter plant belongs to a monotypic genus;  it has leaves much like those of Wenzelia, but much smaller flowers, and  very thin, saucer- shaped seeds covered with small red- brown spots and  having thin fimbriate margins. Until the thin- seeded species of Wenzelia  were discovered, Monanthocitrus was one of the most isolated genera of  the whole tribe Citreae.  The six genera of the Orange subfamily, restricted to the southeastern  or Monsoon area are Clymenia ( Bismarck Archipelago), Monantho­citrus  ( New Guinea), and Eremocitrus ( N. E. Australia), all three  monotypic genera, Oxanthera with four species ( New Caledonia), Micro­citrus  with six species ( N. E. Australia and New Guinea) and Wenzelia  with nine species ( S. Philippines to New Guinea, Solomons and Fiji  Archipelago). Wenzelia is not only the largest of these six genera, but  also the most widely distributed. All of these genera of exclusively  southeastern distribution, belong to the tribe Citreae whi&lt;;: h contains 28  genera of which only five genera, Luvunga ( 12 sp.), Paramignya ( 15  sp.), Citropsis ( 11 sp.), Atalantia ( 10 sp.) and Citrus ( 16 sp.) are  larger than Wenzelia.  A striking proof of the rapid advance of our knowledge of the Citrus  relatives is furnished by the fact that not a single one of the nine species  that now constitute the genus Wenzelia had been described up to 1901!  The second species was published in 1910, the third in 1915 ( when the  genus Wenzelia was established), a fourth in 1918 and the other five  are only now described in this paper.  It is very probable that still more species of Wenzelia will be found  as New Guinea, Celebes, the Moluccas and the Bismarck Archipelago are  more thoroughly explored.  I give without further delay descriptions of the five new species and  one new variety of Wenzelia.  Wenzelia Archboldiana, sp. nov. PLATE 2, FIGURES 1- 5.

Clemens no. 1057,  Dec. 3, 1935, branch with very young fruit ( Herb. Berlin- Dahlem;  photograph in Herb. National Arboretum).  Wenzelia Archboldiana has leaves and flowers much like W. melanesica  from the Solomon Islands some 2000 kilometers to the east, but has very  different oblate- spheroid fruits while those of W. melanesica are slender  and taper to a sharp apex. On the contrary, W. Archboldiana is decid­edly  different in all its characters of leaf, flowers and fruits from W.  platysperma which is native to the same part of New Guinea. All three  species just named are alike in having flattened, thin- margined seeds.  The two fruits of the type specimen of Wenzelia Archboldiana show  several, often 5- 8, fusiform cracks, 8- 12 mm. long and 3- 5 mm. wide at  their broadest, in the outer pericarp, radiating from the axis at the base  and at the tip of the fruit ( Plate 2, figure 1). Most of these cracks run  along the center of the locule wall but some cracks, usually smaller,  radiate along the boundary of two adjacent carpels.  This striking new species has been named in honor of Mr. Richard  Archbold who has organized and led three great collecting and exploring  expeditions to ew Guinea and, by employing expert collectors like  L. J. Brass, has brought back many thousands of herbarium specimens  representing the remarkably interesting plants of New Guinea.  Wenzelia melanesica, sp. nov. PLATES 2, FIGS. 6- 8; 3, FIGs. 1- 3.

Smith' discovered this plant on Kambara Island and gives  the native name mali- mali, apparently a reduplication of the name mali  commonly used in Polynesia for the orange, perhaps because the fruits  of Wenzelia have, when ripe, the color and odor of Citrus. Dr. Smith  has given me much help in the study of this species.  This species is the easternmost large- seeded Citrus relative that occurs  on the islands of the Pacific. Its seeds are so large that it is improbable  that they would have been carried to Fiji by birds especially since the  fruits contain no pulp and little if any mucilaginous matter. It is highly  probable that the mali mali reached the Fiji Archipelago from the center  of origin ( probably New Guinea) of the genus Wenzelia by slowly  spreading eastward over dry land, a migration that would probably have  required millions of years to accomplish.  Dr. Edward C. Zimmerman of the Bishop Museum at Honolulu, who  made possible the identification of this plant, obtained flower buds by  " shooting" the dangerous surf on the atoll surrounding Naiau island.

The trees on aiau  island were taller ( 5- 7 m.) than those reported from Kambara island  ,( 3 m.) but the leaves of the Naiau plants were all smaller ( 6- 10 X  2.5- 5 cm.) than the larger ones from Kambara ( A.

National Arboretum).  This species is known to me only from the rather scanty type speci­men,  but it is so evidently distinct from all the other known species that  I have no hesitation in making it a new species.  It is somewhat of a connecting link between the two subgenera Euwen­zelia  and Papualimo but apparently falls in Euwenzelia as the seeds lack  the paper- thin more or less torn membrane along the free margins of  the seeds found in the species of the section Papualimo.  The fruits of W. tenuifolia are circular in cross section and show five  more or less triangular peripheral ribs at the distal ends of the radial  locule walls, which fill the spaces between the strongly bulged dorsal  locule walls. In striking contrast to this species, W. Archboldiana has  fruits which are bluntly star- shaped in cross section because of the  absence of any tissues filling the inter- locular furrows.  The collector's label on the type specimen is a carbon copy ( the  original label was doubtless used for another specimen of the plant).  The altitude given on the label of the type specimen apparently reads  " altitude c. 11000 feet" but may possibly be " c. 4000 feet." If the  altitude is 4000 feet ( 1220 meters) it would be far above the upper  limit for the Aurantioid plants in New Guinea ( about 300 meters, 914  ft.). If the altitude is 11000 feet ( 3353 meters) it would equal the  highest altitude as yet reported for any Rutaceous plants from New  Guinea.'  As all the other species of Wenzelia grow at low altitudes in tropical  regions it will be of interest to learn more about the distribution of  Wenzelia tenuifolia. Perhaps its curious unusually thin leaves may be  adapted for growth in very humid locations such as occur in the cloud  belts of mountains.  1LAUTERBACH, c., Die Rutaceen Papuasiens ( Bot. ] ahrb. · 55: 221- 223. 1918)  gives the Atwantioideae as having an altitudinal limit of about 300 meters in  New Guinea, but reports that several genera of the Toddalioideae and Xanthoxy­leae  are found growing in cloud and fog belts of the mountains at 800- 1500  meters altitude and that 3 species of Acronychia occur at altitudes from 2700 to  3300 meters. 	asm0188000005																	2009-05-19	2009-05-19	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/wtswingle/id/55	55	56.pdfpage	/wtswingle/image/56.pdfpage

This variety is known only from the type collection. It is possible  that this extremely narrow- leaved form may be found to intergrade  with the species but as yet such intergradations are not in evidence.  It is the most northern form known.  TWO SUBGE ERA IN WENZELIA  The seven species of Wenzelia that are well known, fall into two  groups having very different seeds.  1. EUWENZELIA, subgen. nov.

Page 18																										1940] SWINGLE, RUTACEAE - AURANTIOIDEAE 17  and W. kambarae in the easternmost Lau Islands of the Fiji Archipelago,  about 12,500 kilometers distant!  These three species probably represent ancient ancestral types of  the genus Wenzelia, while the fiat- seeded species found in New Guinea'  and the Solomon Islands doubtless rapidly evolved there into the  subgenus Papualimo.  A NEW SPECIES OF PARAMIGNYA  Paramignya is the second largest genus of the tribe CITREAE and the  largest in the subtribe TRIPHASIINAE. It is closely allied to Luvunga,  another large genus with 12 species. Both of these genera include woody  lianas that climb to the tops of tall forest trees, hanging on to them by  means of their stout retrorse and often recurved spines that are borne  singly in the axils of the leaves. Paramignya has I- foliolate leaves with  pulvinate petioles that enable them to turn to face the light. Luvunga  has 3- foliolate leaves borne on long straight petioles pulvinate at the  base. Both genera are native to southeastern Asia and the East Indian  Archipelago from Sumatra and the Philippines to New Guinea.  The 12 typical species of Paramignya constitute a remarkably uni­form  group and are evidently closely related to each other. Among the  many very interesting plants collected in the island of Hainan by Ameri­can  and Chinese botanists and collectors is a species of Paramignya of  which abundant herbarium specimens are available for study. This  species proves to be a new one.  Paramignya confertifolia, sp. nov. PLATE 4, FIGURES 1, 2.

This interesting species is found abundantly in the Island of Hainan  clambering over shrubs and small trees. It has been identified wrongly  with P. scandens Craib but in reality is much more nearly related to  two new species recently described from Siam by Craib: P. Surasiana  and P. rectispinosa. Both of these last named species and P. conferti­folia  from Hainan agree in having a very short ovary scarcely more than  1 mm. long with a style 4- 5 times as long. The other species of Para­mignya  native in southeastern Asia have much larger ovaries, usually  several mm. tall and the style is only 3 or 4 times as long as the ovary.  The Philippine species, P. longipedunculata Merr., also has a very  short ovary ( about 1.5 mm.) with a very long style ( about 15 mm.)  which is nearly as wide as the ovary and not clearly delimited from it.  However, this Philippine species differs widely in many other characters  from P. confertifolia and is not closely related to it.  The fruits of this species are very peculiar; as they ripen they become  exceedingly irregular in shape, rough and wrinkled. Upon sectioning,  the pericarp is found to be of unusual thickness and to be filled with a  multitude of large and small oil glands. No other species of the Orange  subfamily yet discovered has so striking a development of oil glands in  a soft and spongy pericarp.  A NEW SPECIES OF ATALANTIA  Professor E. D.

Page 23																										22 JOURNAL OF THE ARNOLD ARBORETUM [ VOL. XXI  show a clear- cut inner layer of stalkless subglobose pulp- vesicles lining  the walls of the locule but rather large and variable- sized oil- glands (?)  that are not in a definite layer lining the walls but scattered between  the much smaller oil- glands of the pericarp and the inner wall of the  locule. Study of the fruits of this species at all stages of development  may show that these structures have a merely superficial resemblance  and no true homology with the primitive pulp- vesicles of Severinia  buxifolia and other typical species of Severinia. The typical species  of Atalantia have sessile, broad- based, conical pulp- vesicles growing out  from the dorsal locule walls and, with the seeds, filling the locules com­pletely.  However, Atalantia ceylanica ( Am.) Oliver, the type- species  of the subgenus Rissoa, shows in the mature fruit very few pulp- vesicles,  perhaps because the very large seeds almost completely fill the locules.  This species like Atalantia hainanensis, has a cup- shaped disk fitting  closely around the base of the ovary. Atalantia Guillaumini Swingle,  an anomalous species of which only the very large subglobose, fully  mature fruits are known, does not seem tb have any pulp- vesicles among  the very large seeds.  Study of more complete material of A. Guillaumini and A. hainanensis  may show them both to be aberrant species of Severinia rather than of  Atalantia.

SWINGLE  TWO PLATES  In the tropical regions of the Eastern hemisphere there occurs  a small but very well- marked group of citrous plants having  large fruits with a woody or leathery pericarp, and five or  more locules with numerous seeds embedded in a transparent  glutinous jelly. These so- called hard- shelled citrous fruits com­prise  at present six genera and nine species, and range from the  Philippines west to Liberia in western Africa, and from India  and Indo- China to Java and other Malayan Islands.

These  six genera constitute a natural group inside the tribe Citreae.  This group I propose to recognize as a subtribe Balsamocit1' inae,  1 These genera and species I have described in popular form in L. H.  Bailey's Standard Cyclopedia of Horticulture.

The genera of the Balsarrw­citrinae  are very different from each other and have many dis­tinct  characters of taxonomic importance. In other words they  seem like the widely scattered survivors of a once larger group.  Subtribe BALSAMOCITRINAE Swingle  The genera of this subtribe fall into three divisions or super­genera:  ( 1) Aegle, Balscvlnocitrus, and Aeglopsis, with very  hard- shelled fruits having many locules and trifoliolate or rarely  unifoliolate leaves; ( 2) Feronia and Feroniella, with very hard­shelled  fruits with five locules coalescing into a single cavity,  and pinnate leaves; ( 3) Chaetospermum, with a leathery rinded  8- to lO- celled fruit and trifoliolate leaves.  Recently a new member of the Balsamocitrinae has come to  light in the Malay Peninsula. It is apparently most closely  related to Chaetospermum but differs widely from it as will be  seen from the account given below.  During the winter of 1917- 18 Professor C. F. Baker sent to  me at Washington a fine specimen of the fruit of Murraya  caloxylon Ridl., 5 from a tree growing in the botanic gardens  at Singapore. It was at once apparent that this fruit did not  belong to a plant of the genus Murraya ( Chalcas) but apper­tained  instead to the group mentioned above. As I did not have  a flowering specimen, I hesitated to publish on this plant because  it had so many aberrant characters that it seemed possible the  flower might show unexpected characters.  Upon reaching Manila in July, 1918, I was agreeably sur­prised  to find that Professor E. D. Merrill, acting director of  the Bureau of Science, had secured from Mr. 1. H. Burkill,  director of the Singapore Botanic Gardens, a beautiful flowering  specimen collected in March, 1918, and also fresh fruits from  the same tree. One of these fruits had been kept in the refrig­erator  and was still fresh enough to be studied.  In the meantime Professor C. F. Baker, dean of the College  of Agriculture of the University of the Philippines, had brought  seeds from Singapore and planted them in the college nurseries  at Los Banos, Laguna Province, Luzon. These seedlings enabled  me to observe the germination characters.  Thanks to all this material, as well as my notes on the type  material of the species ( H. C. Robinson 5548) which, through the  courtesy of Mr. E. G. Baker, I was able to study in the British  • Ridley, H. N., New. or rare Malayan plants, Series IV, Journ. Straits  Branch Roy. As. Soc. 50 ( 1908) 111- 114.  XIII, C, 6 Swingle: Merillia, a new Rutaceous Genus 337  Museum, at South Kensington, in 1911, I now feel able to discuss  this remarkable species, in many ways unique among the plants  closely related to Citrus, In the first place all the known mem­bers  of the tribe Cit1" eae have either unifoliolate leaves or else  pinnate leaves with strictly opposite leaflets. The other genera  of the subfamily Citratae, such as Chalcas ( Murraya) , Clausena,  Glycosmis, and Micromelum, have pinnate leaves with alternately  arranged leaflets but never with a winged rachis. Up to now  a single leaf, even if hnmature, would serve to distinguish  any of these genera from the true Citreae. The Singapore  plant has pinnate leaves with alternate leaflets and a narrowly  but clearly winged rachis. All the pinnate- leaved members of  the subfamily Citmtae have a clearly marked petiole below the  first pair of leaflets. The flowering specimen of MU1' raya cal­oxylon,  collected in the Singapore Botanic Gardens in March,  1918, shows sessile or subsessile leaves, the lowest leaflets being  very small, nearly opposite, and attached near to or at the very  base of the rachis. The fruits are even more remarkable, being  like Chaetospe1' mum in having a leathery rind, but differing  widely in the irregularly lacunose pericarp and in having the  walls of the locules solid, The seeds at first glance seem to  be hairy like those of Chaetospermum and Aegle, but closer  examination of what appear to be hairs shows that they are  thin, elongated.. somewhat fimbriate paleae. The seeds also show  an ariloid ridge at one edge, unlike the seeds of the other mem­bers  of this subtribe.  Many other characters of less importance serve to mark off  this plant as perhaps the most remarkably aberrant of the  citrous fruits,  I take pleasure in naming this remarkable new genus in  honor of Professor E. D, Merrill, who has done so much valu­able  work on the flora of the Philippines, the Malayan region,  and southern China.

The original description is as follows:  Murraya calaxylan, n. sp.  A tree of considerable size the branches covered with a pale flaky bark.  Leaves 8 inches or more long with 13 leaflets, rachis flattened and winged  narrow, leaflets 3- 3~ inches long or less by a inch wide, alternate oblan­.  ceolate obtusely acuminate with a triangular base, minutely petiolate  inequilateral thin bright deep green. Flowers pale yellowish green sev­eral  together in small panicles, in the upper axils of a branch, about  an inch long. Sepals connate ovate acute ~ o inch long. Petals and  stamens not seen. Ovary stalked, hairy, style rather stout hairy, stigma  capitulate. Fruit oblong rounded at both ends, 4 inches long and three  inches in diameter, the pericarp dotted and warty greenish eventually  becoming yellow, half an inch thick, lemon yellow inside, full of long  resin cells narrowed at the mouth and dilated below, cells 5, with rather  thick tough walls, pulp of transparent flattened sticky fibers olive green  in colour and tasteless. Seeds numerous about 5 in a section ovate  flattened half an inch long 11 inch thick, olive grey.  Southern Siam: Patani ( Penney); Upper Perak: Kenering at 500 feet  - elevation ( Robinson 5548).  This tree' known as the Katinga is famous in the Malay peninsula  lor its beautiful wood. Thjs handsome wood is of light yellow color,  XIII, C, 6 Swingle: Merillia, a new Rutaceous Genus 339  ornamented with dark brown streaks and strains, fairly hard in, texture  and taking a good polish. Mr. F. Penney obtained a considerable quantity  of the wood from Siamese territory North of Province Wellesley, from  which he had made furniture, boxes, etc., which was very highly valued  on account of its beauty. He obtained also leaves and fruit of the  tree. For the flowers I am indebted to Mr. H. C. Robinson, who met  with it in Upper Perak.  It differs from other species of the genus in the greater size of the  leaves, the conspicuously stalked ovary, and the remarkable fruit which  resembles a citron. The rind has a bitter terpentiney flavour, and the  comparatively scanty pulp is quite tasteless. The fruit is so entirely  different from that of any other species of the genus that the plant  might almost be separated generically.  In the introduction to the fourth series of New or Rare  Malayan Plants 6 the following paragraph occurs:  The well known furniture wood Katinga from the Siamese borders  has long been prized and I obtained leaves and a fruit some years ago  from Mr. F. G. Penney, who had a fine collection of furniture made from  its wood. A number of young plants were raised in the Botanic Gardens,  and I lately obtained specimens shewing parts of the flower from Mr.  H. C. Robinson. It proves to be a Murraya allied to the well known  Kamuning wood, so much valued for the handles and sheaths of Krises.  As Ridley did not have good flowering specimens or fresh  fruits the original description should be supplemented in · some  particulars and emended in others. The following notes were  made from the flowering specimen and fruit collected in March,  1918, from the tree cultivated in the Singapore Botanic Gardens.  The leaves of fruiting twigs are sessile, pinnate, with 6 to 8  alternate leaflets. The petiole is very short or wanting, the  rachis 10 to 15 cm long, narrowly winged, the wing increasing  in width gradually up to the point of attachment of the leaflets,  then suddenly diminishing. The leaflets are very unequal in size  and shape, the basal ones- sometimes a pair nearly opposite­being  very small, 5 to 10 mm in diameter, and very broad, often  suborbicular. The lateral leaflets increase rapidly in size up  to the penultimate, and at the same time become narrower and  more pointed, becoming also somewhat inequilateraI. The penul­tilnate  leaflet is 70 to 80 by 20 to 30 mm, rhomboid- Ianceolate,  subacuminate at the apex but with the very tip bluntly rounded;  the base is cuneate. The terminal leaflet is like the penultimate  in shape but symmetrical, 80 to 100 by 30 to 35 mm. The  margins of the leaflets are wavy, sometimes slightly serrate.  The very young leaves, like the young twigs, are minutely  pubescent, but the older leaflets become nearly glabrous. The  • Ridley, H. N., op. cit., p. ~ 11.  340 The Philippine Journal of Science 1918  oil dots are small but very numerous. Inflorescences 1- or 2­flowered,  axillary, pedicels slender with a few minute bracts.  The flower buds are very large, 35 to 45 by 10 to 12 mm, greenish­white.  The petals are 35 to 40 by 5 to 10 mm, bluntly pointed  at the apex and narrowed gradually to the base. Stamens 10,  . unequal, filaments long, slender, free. Pistil 20 to 25 mm long,  slightly hairy, with a clavate ovary narrowing abruptly into  the cylindric style 12 to 15 mm long, which ends in a capitate  stigma. Ovary 5- or 6- celled, narrowing gradually toward the  base. Fresh fruits subglobose, when dry often slightly oval,  70 to 80 mm in diameter, nearly smooth, gray- green with a  leathery pericarp 10 to 12 mm thick with irregular branched  lacunae filled with a resinous gum; loculae 5 or 6, with carti­laginous  solid walls 3 to 4 mm thick, the locules filled with a  transparent jellylike gum surrounding the seeds. Seeds 8 to  10 in a locule, lenticular, 9 to 10 by 7 to 8 by 3.5 to 4 mm,  gray- green in color, abundantly provided with very thin, elon­gated,  hairlike, slightly fimbriate paleae 6 to 10 mm long, 0.25  to 2 mm wide. Near the hilum on the angle of the seed is a  light yellowish- gray ariloid ridge 5 to 7 mm long and 1 to 2  mm high; because of the numerous hairlike fimbriate paleae  the seeds almost completely fill the space, the interstices alone  being filled with transparent jellylike gum. In the fresh fruits  the paleae of the seeds being embedded in the transparent gum  are very inconspicuous, but become increasingly conspicuous as  the fruit dries.  On germination the cotyledons remain buried, the first pair  of foliage leaves are opposite, entire, broadly lanceolate, the  next few foliage leaves are pinnate with more and more leaflets.  The leaflets - often have sharply serrate margins.  The specimens studied at Manila, collected in March, 1918,  as well as the fruits sent to Washington and the seeds planted  at Los Banos, all come from a tree in the Singapore Botanic  Gardens. It is probable that it was grown from seeds taken  from the fruit sent to the former director, H. N. Ridley, " some  years" before 1908, collected by F. G. Penney in southern Siam,  especially as Ridley states in his original description of the  species that he then had seedlings in the botanic garden. If  planted, say in 1904, the tree would have been old enough to  bear fruit in 1917 when Professor Baker collected fruits.  POSSIBLE ECONOMIC USES OF THE KATINGA  If the katinga proves to be rather closely related to Chaeto­spermum  it is not improbable that, like Chaetospermum gluti-  XIII, C, 6 Swingle: Merillia, a new Rutaceous Genus 341  nosum ( Blanco) Swingle, it may be used as a stock upon which  to graft the commonly cultivated species of Citrus. Mr. Ridley  has called attention to the beauty of the wood of the katinga  and Mr. F. G. Penney secured enough of this wood in southern  Siam to make a much- admired set of furniture. The flowers are  very large and it is possible that this species would be worthy  of cultivation as an ornamental plant. At any rate it deserves  a place in every tropical and subtropical botanic garden and  arboretum.

A lemon- lime hybrid _  Summary _  Literature cited _  Page  15  17  18  HYBRIDS OF THE TANGELO GROUP  In the course of breeding new types of citrus fruits numerous  reciprocal crosses have been made, most of the varieties commonly  grown being utilized as parents as well as some little- known citrus  and related species. The more important of these citrus hybrids  have been described in short papers from time to time, these de­scriptions  dealing chiefly with the citranges ( 5, 10)/ limequats ( 5,  ( i, 9, 11), citrangequats ( 9), and tangelos ( 5,7,8).  The citranges are hybrids of the deciduous trifoliate oranges  ( Poncirus trifoliata ( L.) Raf.), hardy as . far north as ' Washington,  D. C., and Philadelphia, Pa., and the common sweet orange ( Oitrus  sinensis ( L.) Osbeck). The citrange is the hardiest edible citrus  fruit; but although often beautiful, the different varieties are , ery  sour, have a bitter aftertaste, and are used only sparingly for" ade."  The citranges make excellent stocks for the commonly cultivated  citrus fruits and are used chiefly for this purpose.  The limequats are hybrids of the West Indian lime ( Oitrus auran­tifolia  ( Christm.) Swingle) and the kumquat, two species, F01' tu­nella  japonica ( Thunb.) Swingle and F. marga)' rita ( Lour.) Swingle,.  being used in these hybrids. The limequats bear fruits much like  ordinary limes in size, shape, color, and flavor, but the tree is much  hardier than the lime and can be grown in far colder climates,  nearly up to the northern limit of citrus culture.  The citrangequats, as the name indicates, are hybrids of the cit­range  and the kumquat, and they bear small acid fruits som~ what  like limes but of inferior quality. The citrangequat tree, however  is much hardier than the West Indian lime or even the limequat, but  1 Italic numbers in parentheses refer to Literature Cited, p. 18.  63490°- 31-- 1 1 	asm0188000007																	2009-05-19	2009-05-19	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/wtswingle/id/74	74	75.pdfpage	/wtswingle/image/75.pdfpage
Page 4																										2 CIRCULAR 181, U. S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE  is not quite so hardy as the citrange. Some of the citrangequats  are being used for stock, to which purpose they seem to be fairly  well adapted.  Of all these hybrids, the tangelos have attracted the most favorable  , attention because they yield a whole new series of orangelike fruits,  many of them more beautifully colored than any orange and of  exquisite flavor and aroma. But unfortunately they are often too  soft to stand up well under long- distance shipment if packed in the  usual way.  PREVIOUS TANGELO HYBRIDS  The tangelo, a hybrid between the tangerine ( Oitrus nobilis deli­ciosa  ( Ten.) Swingle) and the grapefruit ( 0. grandis ( L.) Osbeck),  was one of the first of the early crosses to be selected for propaga­tion.  Two varieties, the Sampson and the Thornton, have been  previously described ( 5,7,14,15), and trees 0'£ these varieties have  been obtainable through the nursery trade, especially in Florida, since  about 1915. The first crosses givmg rise to these new fruits were  made in 1897 at Eustis, Fla., by the senior writer, and in 1898 ad­ditional  crosses were made by H. J. Webber. The severe freeze of  1899 acted as a check on the active developJ; l1ent of these and other  new hybrids, and it was five years or mo're before specimen trees  yielded fruit for testing. A few small commercial groves in  Florida are now planted to tangelos, chiefly of the Sampson variety,  but the marketing is mainly confined to a private- order trade with  fancy- fruit dealers or with individuals who appreciate the unique  piquancy of these new fruits.  As pointed out in previous publications, the Sampson and Thorn­ton  varieties are handicapped as commercial fruits by certain charac­teristics  that haYe restricted their planting. While thrifty in  growth and prolific, the fruit needs special care in handling in  order to reach the market in salable condition. The modern pack­ing  house subjects citrus fruits to a rather involved process of  cleaning and polishing before they are graded, sized, and packed;  therefore a good shipping fruit must have a fairly tough rind and  solid flesh. The Sampson tangelo is so thin skinned that it is easily  bruised; moreover, it is very susceptible to sun scald and has a  tendency, especially when grown on rough lemon stock, toward the  drying out of one or more segments, often confused with sun scald.  This variety is also very susceptible to citrus scab ( 16, 17); conse­quently  it is difficult in some seasons to produce even a fair percentage  of unblemished fruit. It turns yellow months before it is ripe, and  colors to an attractive deep- orange tint several weeks before it is  fully mature; in consequence it is often picked and shipped when  mnch too acid for consumption. It is not at its best until February  or March.  The juice of the Sampson tangelo has such a characteristic" tana "  that it is in growing demand for making" tangelo- ade." In prep~ r­~  ng t~ is " ade" it ~ s ~ ot ?- ecessary to. use all t~ ngelo juice, be. cause the  JUIce Imparts a dIstmctIve quahty If added m the proportIOn of 25  per cent, or even less, to orange or grapefruit juice or to a mixture  of these juices. This use of tangelo juice has afforded a profitable  outlet for second- grade fruit and has helped to encourage the plant­ing  of this variety, especially in Dade County, Fla. 	asm0188000007																	2009-05-19	2009-05-19	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/wtswingle/id/75	75	76.pdfpage	/wtswingle/image/76.pdfpage
Page 5																										NEW CITRUS HYBRIDS 3  The Thornton tangelo matures much earlier than the Sampson,  often being sweet and delicious in December, although holding well  into March or even later. In appearance it is somewhat coarse, with  a roughened or pebbly rind; but its chief handicap is that when ripe  it becomes so soft and puffy that it suffers injury when subjected to  the regular packing- house treatment, and it therefore needs hand  grading and packing t, o stand long- distance ship t. Notwith­standing  these handicaps, both varieties have enthusiastic adherents,  and both will doubtless continue in cultivation, on a limited scale  at least. 2  Like many of the citrus hybrids, the Sampson tangelo comes true  from seed with striking regularity. Hundreds of seedlings have been  grown without revealing vegetative diversity, and in a group of 42  seedlings brought to fruiting at Little River, Fla., all showed re­markable  adherence to type in growth and fruit characteristics.  This uniformity is due to the fact that this hybrid is sterile in the  sense that the seed is developed from the tissues of the mother plant,  and consequently reproduces the variety without change ( 6).  In vegetative propagation the Sampson, as well as most other  tangelo varieties, differs from the parental fruits. Cuttings of the  tangerine and the grapefruit may be rooted, but with considerable  difficulty, only a small percentage striking root even when given  favorable conditions. Leafy twig cuttings of the tangelo, however,  may be rooted without difficulty and with only moderate loss if care  is taken to maintain proper conditions of humidity and temperature,  such as is afforded by a humid greenhouse chamb&' with bottom  heat or by the solar propagation frame especially devised by the  writers for the propagation of citrus cuttings ( 113). The greater  readiness with which citrus hybrids may be rooted from cuttings as  compared with the parental varieties has been already noted in the  case of the Thomasville citrangequat ( 9).  As t, he publications in which the original tangelos ( Sampson and  Thornton) were first described have been out of print for a long  time, a description of these varieties in the light of recent experience  is here given.  S~ MPSON T~ NGELO  ( C. P.

S. Department  of Agriculture, tests of the tangelos ( Sampson and Thornton varieties) as sources of  vitamin B were made in 1928. In these tests the tangelo was compared with the parental  fruits, tangerine and grapefruit. Charts showing the weight curves of rats fed the des­ignated  fruits as a source of vitamin B were prepared but as yet are unpublished. The  follOWing summary may be given at this time. with the approval of Breese Jones and E. 1\ 1.  Nelon, who carried out these vitamin tests: Both charts are in agreement in showing tan­gerine  juice to be a better source of vitamin B than the juice of the other fruits fed, and  also in that tangelo juice is approximatelY {' qual in vitamin B potency to grapefruit juice.  Therefore, with respect to vitarrrin B production the tangelo has inherited the charac­teristics  of the grapefruit.

THORNTON TAKGELO  ( C. P. B. 1282; pI. 1)  The original records of the group of hybrids giving rise to the  Thornton tangelo were lost, so that the pollen parent is not definitely  known. As many of the sister hybrids show unmistakable tangerine  characteristics, however, it is safe to say that this fruit is a tangelo  with grapefruit the known seed parent. For some years after it  first fruited its original hybrid number was also unknown, but identi­cal  fruit under C. P. B. 1282 has been produced for several years  at Little River, Mount Dora, and Eustis, Fla., leaving little doubt  as to its proper place in the series of hybrids made by the senior  writer in 1899.  Tecll1licaZ description.- Fruit the size of a small grapefruit, 3lA, to 3%, inches  in transverse diameter by 2% to 3lA, inches in height, flattened at blossom end  and tapering slightly toward stem end, calyx set in slight depression, having  shallow radiating grooves in the rind; color similar to common orange ( Ridg­way,  orange buff to deep chrome); rind soft and thick ( three- sixteenths to  one- fourth inch), somewhat wrinkled and pebbly, the roughness in part due  to deepl~' indented large and numerous oil cells, free peeling, of kid- glove  character and puffy when ripe; segments 10 t{) 12, separating easily and hav­ing  considerable adhering membrane or rag, open core with pithy central  column; pulp very soft and melting, juicy, translucent, of mild flavor, sweet,  somewhat lacking in acidity, especially when fully ripe, slight aroma; color  of pulp, pale orange ( Rid" gway, orange buff to deep chrome); seeds varying  from 10 to 25 per fruit, long and slender, resembling orange seeds but greenish  in cross section. Tree evergreen, thrifty and productive, about as tender as  grapefruit; leaves unifoliate, rather large and long- pointed, resembling common,  sweet orange rather than either parent.  The season of this fruit is from December to March.  The Thornton tangelo grown in the intensely hot, irrigated  Coachella Valley at the Umted States Experiment Date Garden at  Indio, Calif., has shown itself to be very well adapted to this severe  climate. Although the fruit is smaller than that grown in Florida,  it is of excellent quality.  WILLIAMS TANGELO  ( C. P. B. 1397; PI. 1)  The Sampson tangelo resulted from a cross in which pollen of the  Dancy tangerine was used to pollinate an ordinary grapefruit. The  grapefruit so cross- pollinated contained a large number of seeds, 76  j. n all, which gave a total of 106 seedlings ( several seeds sending out 	asm0188000007																	2009-05-19	2009-05-19	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/wtswingle/id/77	77	78.pdfpage	/wtswingle/image/78.pdfpage

Page 9																										A NEW SERIES OF TANGELOS  A new series of crosses was made in the period from 1908 to 1912  by the senior writer and his assistants, E. M. Savage and the late  F. W. Savage, working principally at Eustis and Glen St. Mary,  Fla. These cross- pollinations included not only the tangelo group  but also a very wide variety of combinations between citrus varieties  and species. In the tangelo group it was hoped that the use of dif­ferent  parents and the growing of a much larger number of seed­lings  from cross- pollinated fruits would lead to securing tangelos  of better shipping qualities, less subject to scab, and yet retaining  the attractive appearance and peculiar zest of these desirable fruits.  These hopes have been realized in a measure, though further tests  on a larger scale will be necessary before final selections can be made.  more than one sprout), and these seedlings were serially numbered  from 1310 to 1415. With the exception of the Sampson tangelo  ( C. P. B. 1316), most of the seedlings appeared to be false hybrids  or ordinary grapefruit; however, a number of them were distrIbuted  to cooperators to be tested for possible hybrid character.  Several seedlings were sent to H. S. Williams, of Rockledge, Fla.,  about 1900, only one of which proved to be a hybrid ( C. P. B. 1397).  Thus this fruit is a sister hybrid of the Sampson tangelo ( C. P. B.  1316), though of quite different character. However, trees under  this number that fruited at Little River and Mount Dora, Fla., pro­duced  fruit identical with that of C. P. B. 1397.  No propagation of C. P. B. 1397 appears to have been made at  Rockledge, but E. S. ' Yilliams, son of H. S. Williams, took bud wooel  later to Fort Pierce, Fla., ' where he propagated the variety and set out  a gro, e of several acres. The fruit was found profitable for use in  supplying some of the tourist hotels on the east coast and in filling  private orders. In the region where grown it is commonly called the  ' Villiams tangelo, and that name is herein adopted.  Technical description.- Fruit of the size, shape, and general appearance of  grapefruit, though decidedly flattened, deeply depressed at blossom end, with  less marked depression surrounding calyx, from which radiate shallow  groo, es; transverse diameter of fruit 33,4 to 4 inches, , ertical diameter 2% to  3 inches; color, grapefruit yellow slightly tinged with orange ( Ridgway,  cadmium ~- elJow) ; rind of medium thickness ( one- eighth to three- sixteenths  inch), fairly free peeling, smooth and glossy, oil cells very small and numerous,  Rlightly indented; segments numerous, 13 to 15, regular, with rather large open  core, separating easily like a tangerine; seeds , arying from 10 to 15, wbite in  cross section, reS€ mbling grapefruit seeds; pulp of melting quality, very tender  and juicy, with little rag, of amber color ( Ridgway, primuline yellow), f1a, or  mildly subacid and of pleasing quality when ripe, lacking the bitterness of  grapefruit but not insipid. Tree evergreen, thrifty and productive, of general  habit of grapefruit; leaves unifoliate, resembling rather large orange leaves,  petiole wings variable.  The season of this tangelo in Florida is from late January to  March, slightly earlier than the Sampson. Its shape and rind char­acter  make it a good shipping fruit, though it shows a tendency to  dry out if held on the trees past full maturity. In its general re­semblance  to a small or medium- sized grapefruit it lacks the dis­tinctive  character of the other tangelos that have been selected for  propagation, but possesses sufficient merit to warrant its inclusion  in collections of citrus fruits for the home fruit garden or local  markets.  NEW CITRUS HYBRIDS 5 	asm0188000007																	2009-05-19	2009-05-19	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/wtswingle/id/80	80	81.pdfpage	/wtswingle/image/81.pdfpage
Page 10																										6 CIRCULAR 181, U. S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE  The excellence of some of these new fruits, however, justifies the pub­lication  of descriptions and giving them convenient names for future  identification. In making selections one important feature has been  kept in mind- to render possible a longer shipping season by secur­ing  both extra early and extra late maturing sorts. The selection of  a new fruit that meets requirements of this sort may be justified,  even though it falls short of the ideal in some other respect. Seed­lessness  ( or few seeds) is likewise a character important enough to  receive consideration in appraising the value of a new citrus fruit.  The season of maturity assigned to these new fruits in this cir­cular  is based on their behavior at Eustis, Fla., during and prior  to the season 1928- 29. In the season following, arsenical sprays  used in the clean- up campaign for the Mediterranean fruit fly  resulted in premature ripening in many instances. The time of  maturity may prove to be somewhat earlier or later in other parts  of Florida, and doubtless will be influenced by stocks used and  culture given. Experiments to evaluate these factors are in prog­ress  in several test plantings in Florida.  LAKE TANGELO  ( C. P. B. 52018- G- 26; pI. 2)  The Lake tangelo is the earliest maturing of the new tangelos.  It is the result of a cross in which the Bowen grapefruit was pol­linated  with pollen from the Dancy tangerine. The fruit matures  in time for the Thanksgiving market, although keeping in good  condition till two months later. The name Lake has been chosen  because of its first fruiting at Eustis, in Lake County, Fla., where  it has fruited four seasons.  Technical description.- The fruit is small for a tangelo, the size and shape  of a large tangerine, but more nearly resembling a highly colored orange in  general appearance. In size the average fruit is 3 inches in transverse  diameter by 2%, inches in vertical diameter; of deep orange color ( Ridgway,  orange chrome), becoming almost tangerine red when fully mature; rind  one- eighth inch thick, slightly pebbly though not rough, firm, with charac­teristic  shallow grooves radiating from stem end, calyx slightly depressed,  blossom end flattened with slight depression when fully mature; oil cells  small, numerous, indented; segments 12 to 14, with 10 to 12 seeds ( rather  short and plump, closely grouped at center); open core, little rag; pulp of  deep- orange color ( Ridgway, cadmium orange), tender and melting, very  juicy, sweet with rather low acidity but not insipid. Tree evergreen, thrifty  in habit, prolific; leaves unifoliate, variable in size, small to medium ( 3 to 4  inches long), pointed with gently rounded base, petioles rather short, variable,  either winged or wingless.  The attractive appearance and early maturity of this fruit espe­cially  recommend it for the fancy trade, supplying a need at a time  when tangerines are not yet sufficiently mature for shipment. It is  not, however, a kid- glove fruit but is more like a hIghly colored  sweet orange in character.  SEMINOLE TANGELO  ( C. P. B. 52018- F- 23; pI. 3)  The Seminole tangelo ranks next to the Lake in earliness of ma­turity,  ripening in December, about as early as the Thornton, and  holding well into March. Like the Lake tangelo, it resulted from 	asm0188000007																	2009-05-19	2009-05-19	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/wtswingle/id/81	81	82.pdfpage	/wtswingle/image/82.pdfpage

Page 15																										NEW CITRUS HYBRIDS 7  pollinating the Bowen grapefruit with pollen of the Dancy tangerine.  The fruit is somewhat larger than the Lake tangelo, but smaller than  the Thornton or the Sampson; in general appearance it is more like  a highly colored orange. The variety is named Seminole from the  springs of that name located in Lake County, Fla.  Technical description.- Fruit of average size is 314 inches in transverse  diameter by 2%, inches in vertical diameter, decidedly flattened at blossom end  and without the nipple at the stem end characteristic of the Sampson; calyx  small and angular, 5- pointed; rind smooth and glossy, of deep reddish orange  color ( Ridgway, orange chrome), thin but firm ( one- eighth to three- sixteenths  inch thick), fairly tight but peeling more easily than the common sweet orange;  oil cells some\ vhat translucent; indented, slightly corrugated area surrounding  calyx; segments 11 to 13, somewhat irregular in shape and size; seeds fairly  numerous, 20 to 25, or even more, but small, short, plump, and closely grouped  at center, greenish in cross section; pulp of rich orange color ( Ridgway, mikadO  orange), translucent, tender and melting, little rag, agreeable aroma, and  sprightly flayor closely resembling the Sampson tangelo but with less acidity.  Tree evergreen, fairly vigorous and productive; leaves unifoliate, rather small  and rounded ( I%, inches to 2Y2 inches long), slightly recurved or boat shapeu  ( resembling Sampson) ; odor of tangerine well marked in new foliage, petioles  narrow, wingless or very narrowly winged.  This is one of the most attractive of the new hybrids, or of citrus  fruits generally. The rind character and the shape of the fruit give  evidence of good shipping qualities; there is no tendency to sun scald  or to dry out, and there seems to be decided resistance to citrus- scab  infection, as compared with the Sampson tangelo.  MINNEOLA TANGELO  ( c. P. B. 52018- Q; pI. 4)  The Minneola tangelo is OT the same parentage as the Lake and  Seminole tangelos, but it is still later in maturity, being at its best  from February to April. Its high color, good shipping quality, and  few seeds especially recommend this new fruit for consideration and  trial. It has been given the Seminole Indian name of Minneola  ( Min- ne- o'la) after the town of that name in Lake County, Fla.  Technical descripUon.- Fruit the size and shape of a medium- large flattened  orange, average fruit 314 inches in transverse diameter by 3 inches in vertical  diameter; cal~- x small, its area often slightly raised but not forming a distinct  nipple ( as in the Sampson); color when fully ripe a deep reduish orange  ( Ridgway, orange chrome to flame scarlet), fairly smooth, slightly roughened  by oil- cell indentations; rind thin to medium ( one- eighth to three- sixteenths  inch), firm, not free peeling; segments 10 to 12, with rather tough :;; egment  walls and small open core; seeds comparatively few in number, 7 to 12, small  and closely grouped in center, greenish in cross section; pulp of orange color  ( Ridgway, mikado orange), translucent, tender, melting, very juicy, somewhat  aromatic, combining desirable sweetness and acidity, resembling the Sampson  tangelo but more mild in flavor. Tree evergreen, vigorous, and productive;  leaves unifoliate, rather large, varying from 3% to 5 inches in length, long  pointed, tapering more abruptly at the base, petiole of medium size, narrow  to medium size winglets.  The difference in season of this tangelo as compared with the  Lake and Seminole, the attractive color, good shipping quality,  few- seeded character, and excellent flavor recommend this fruit for  consideration and trial. It is moderately susceptible to scab, but  does not become nearly so badly disfigured as the Sampson when  attacked. It shows no tendency to sun scald or drying out, either  on the tree or in storage. In shape, size, and color it resembles 	asm0188000007																	2009-05-19	2009-05-19	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/wtswingle/id/86	86	87.pdfpage	/wtswingle/image/87.pdfpage

DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE  the Temple orange ( the latter probably being a natural hybrid of  the tangelo group), but has a smoother and tougher rind that is  less likely to dry out or suffer injury from handling. It has, how­ever,  an entirely different flavor from the Temple orange and fewer  seeds.  YALAHA TANGELO  ( C r. B. 52016- K- 12; pI. 5)  Resembling the Minneola tangelo in a general way, the Yalaha  has about the same. season of maturity but is not quite so striking a  fruit. ", Yith its slightly roughened rind it resembles the Thornton,  but in character of pulp, especially in acidity, it suggests also the  Sampson. The rina character indicates good shipping and keeping  qualities, especially for the late market in March and April or even  later. It has been given the Seminole Indian name of Yalaha  ( Ya- Hi'ha), from the town of that name in Lake County, Fla.,  where it has fruited for several seasons.  Technical desoription.- Fruit of shape and size of small grapefruit, 3%  inches in transverse diameter by 2%, inches in vertical diameter; calyx per­sistent,  angular, set in slight depression with shallow radiating grooves in the  rind; blossom end distinctly flattened with slight depression around pistil  mark; color shading from orange ( Ridgway, orange) at stem end to reddish  orange ( Ridgway, orange chrome) at blossom end; rind somewhat roughened  and pebbly, in part due to large, deeply indented oil cells, of medium thick­ness  ( three- sixteenths inch), rather large open core; numerous slender seeds  ( 20 to 25), greenish in cross section; segments 8 to 10; pulp tender, juicy, with  little rag, of pale amber color ( Ridgway, capucine buff), translucent; fla, or  rather acid until fully ripe, but a good blending of sweetness and acidity when  mature. Tree evergreen, vigorous, m::; d productive; leaves unifoliate. pointerl  oval with rounded base, resembling sweet- orange leaves, having narrow- winged  petioles.  The Yalaha is perhaps the best of the late- maturing tangelos that  have thus far fruited. The ohief objections to it are the number of  seeds and the size of open core. In young trees it is inclined to fruit  in clusters, a habit that tends to produce pear- shaped fruits, but  which is likely to disappear as the tree attains greater age.  CLEMENT TANGELO  ( c. P. B. 49855)  Aside from the tangelos of commercial importance, there are  occasionally found among the numerous hybrids fruiting each year  novel and interesting fruits which, although of little commercial  promise, have a special appeal for the connoisseur because of some  particular quality. There is a field for such fruits as luxury prod­ucts  or novelties, which justifies the propagation of such new types,  at least for the home fruit garden or for the specialist in fruit  production.  In a group of crosses between the grapefruit ( as the seed parent)  and the Clementine tangerine, some interesting fruits have been  secured. These crosses are of special interest, as the pollen parent,  the Clementine, is reputed by its discoverer, the late L. Trabut. to  have originated as a natural hybrid between the Granito, a peculiar  strain of the bigarade or sour orange, and the tangerine ( 13). It is  classed, however, as a tangerine, being of kid- glove character and 	asm0188000007																	2009-05-19	2009-05-19	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/wtswingle/id/87	87	88.pdfpage	/wtswingle/image/88.pdfpage

Page 19																										NEW CITRUS HYBRIDS 9  developing a high color approaching the Dancy tangerine. The first  introduction of the Clementine into the United States was in 1909  through bud wood sent by Doctor Trabut, who was chief of the  botanical service of Algeria, to the senior writer, who propagated the  variety at Glen St. Mary, Fla. The Clementine is the leading variety  of the kid- glove group grown in northern Africa and is being planted  to some extent in Florida, California, and southern Texas. The  crosses with grapefruit in which the Clementine has been used as the  pollen parent have resulted in a wide diversity of plants and fruits.  These show greater hardiness than the Dancy tangerine crosses, a  characteristic which accords with that quality in the Clementine.  The fruits as a class are inclined to be loose skinned and rather puffy.  One of the best of this group has been selected for propagation and  has been named the Clement tangelo, as an indication of its relation­ship  to the Clementine tangerine.  Technical description.- The fruits of this variety are rather variable in shape,  from oblong oval to depressed globose, the size of a small grapefruit ( 3% to 3V2  inches in diameter); calyx persistent, depressed area around calyx wrinkled  and grooved; color grapefruit yellow with slight orange tinge ( Ridgway, light  orange yellow); rind soft, thick ( one- fourth inch), with oil cells numerous,  deeply indented, giving characteristic pebbled appearance, with some wrinkling,  free peeling, large open core; pulp of peculiar soft jellylike consistency devoid  of fiber and easily removed without squirting of juice, of pale amber color  ( Ridgway, capucine buff), pulp vesicles very small; segments 10 to 12, irregular  in shape and size; seeds long and slender, number variable, usually one seed  to a segment, occasional fruits entirely seedless; flavor mild and sweet, low in  acidity but not insipid unless overripe; maturing in December and January.  Tree evergreen, vigorous, and fairly productive; leaves unifoliate, medium to  large in size, 4 to 5V2 inches in length, shape long- pointed oval with winged  petiole, slightly recurved along midrib, resembling the Clementine leaf in this  respect but to a less degree.  While this tangelo is not as striking in appearance as the others  herein described, the finely wrinkled rind ! 6ives it individualitl by  which it may be recognized, and the " sqmrtless" character 0 the  pulp, its smooth consistency, and mild flavor will recommend it to  many lovers of citrus fruits.  WEKIWA TANGELO  ( c. P. B. 47220; pI. 6)  In the course of making a series of back crosses, a pink- fleshed  tangelo was secured as a result of using pollen of the Sampson  tangelo on a seedling grapefruit. This unique hybrid was described  by the writers in a previous paper ( 8), and fruiting trees are to be  found in a number of citrus collections in Florida, although it is  not recommended for commercial planting on a large scale. In the  original description no formal name was assigned this fruit, but it  has commonly been referred to as the pink tangelo. The name  Wekiwa ( We- ki- wa) is here given to it, after a famous spring in  Orange County, Fla.  In making this back cross it was expected that the resulting hybrids  would more nearly resemble the grapefruit, the seed parent. The  male parent, however, the Sampson tangelo, proved dominant, the  fruit bearing little resemblance to grapefruit but showing distinct  tangelo character. This is not only true , of the fruit itself, but is  especially marked in the foliage characters.

Page 20																										10 CIRCULAR 181, U. S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE  leaves, like the Sampson, are strongly constricted and recurved  ( boat shaped), giving the tree a peculiar appearance easily rec­ognized.  In several similar back crosses the pollen parent ( Sampson  tangelo) has proved dominant to a marked degree.  Like the Sampson, the Wekiwa tangelo comes true from seed,  s~ veral seedlings fruiting at Indio, Calif., showing no variation from  the parental form in . fruit or tree characteristics.  Technical Mscription.- Fruit variable in size, but usually of small to medium  size, 2: 1,4 to 2%, inches in diameter, spherical or slightly flattened, occasionally  pyriform; color resembling grapefruit ( Ridgway, pI. I, pinard yellow to  primuline yellow), often having pink blotches, especially where fruits are in  contact; rind thin or of medium thickness ( one- eighth to three- sixteenths  inch), smooth and glossy, oil cells conspicuous, large, and flush with surface,  devoid of bitter principle common in rind of citrus fruits; segments 9 or 10,  segment walls and inner rind tinged with color ( Ridgway, peach red to  Corinthian red) that appears to permeate the translucent pulp vesicles ( which,  however, are not so colored, but are amber in shade) ; seeds variable in number,  usually averaging one to a segment, some fruits entirely seedless; pulp re­sembling  grapefruit in appearance, with large, translucent vesicles, tender,  juicy, very sweet, slightly aromatic, somewhat lacking in acidity but not  insipid. Tree evergreen, rather weak grower, fairly productive; leaves small,  2 to 21; 2 inches long, rounded oval in shape, peculiarly recurved or constricted,  giving tree a characteristic appearance.  This fruit reaches maturity by early November but remajns in  good condition for several months. The pulp loses color, however~  as it passes full maturity in late December. This earliness in matur­ing  is in sharp contrast to the usual time of maturity of both parents,  the Sampson tangelo being especially late in maturing. It is thus  unique both for the pinkish color and for earliness, and has an  extreme sweetness greatly relished by some.  More recently a similar back cross ( C. P. B. 52014- A- 10, Bowen  grapefruit X Sampson tangelo) has given rise to another pink­fleshed  hybrid that is smaller and generally inferior as compared  with the Wekiwa tangelo, but resembles it in physical make- up.  Experiments in growing the Wekiwa tangelo in Florida have not  encouraged its commercial planting, as it has not proved to be a  thrifty tree, and it is usually somewhat dwarfed. A numLer of  trees growing at the United States Experiment Date Garden at  Indio, Calif., have not shown any such weakness, and the fruit has  proved to be early maturing, holding well under the severe climatic  conditions of that region. Despite the handicaps of small size and  weak growth in Florida, the fruit is so relished by some people  that it will probably be desired for home fruit gardens and for  collections of varieties adapted to supplying a private trade.  BAN JACINTO TANGELO  ( C. P. B. 1213- D; pI. 7)  Tangelos when grown in the coastal districts of California are  usually found to produce small- sized fruits, rather mediocre in  9.! lality; however, a number of tangelos that have been tested at the  United States Experiment Date Garden at Indio, Calif., in an  extremely hot, dry climate suitable for date culture have produced  larger and better- flavored fruits. Apparently the extreme climate  of Indio is much more favorable to most tangelos than is the cool  coastal climate of California. 	asm0188000007																	2009-05-19	2009-05-19	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/wtswingle/id/91	91	92.pdfpage	/wtswingle/image/92.pdfpage

Page 23																										NEW CITRUS HYBRIDS 11  The Thornton tangelo does well in the date country, making fruit  of £ air size and flavor, which ripens between Thanksgiving and New  Year's Day. The Sampson tangelo, although sometimes showing  slight sunburn of both leaves and fruit, usually produces a fair  crop of medium- sized fruit that is juicy and of good flavor.  Several other tangelos have been yielding good fruits, especially  a seedling of C. P. B. 1213, this number havmg shown little promise  in Florida because of the" bottle neck" at the stem end of the fruit  and its tendency to become insipid early in the season. The seedling  of this number, C. P. B. 1213- D, grown at the Indio garden, however,  has produced early ripening fruit of good size and flavor and of  better keeping and shipping qualities than the Thornton tangelo  growing alongside. The seed parent of this new fruit was a tangelo  resulting from one of the early crosses in the same group with the  Thornton, which it somewhat resembles.  Because of its first fruiting at Indio, in the general region of San  Jacinto Mountain, a famed landmark guarding the pass to the Salton  Basin, it is proposed to call this the San Jacinto tangelo.  Technical description.- Fruit round oblate, with slight depression at blossom  end, usually with slightly raised area surrounding calyx, not constituting,  however, a bottle- neck protrusion; size ranging from 3 inches in transverse  diameter by 2%, inches in height to 2112 inches in transverse diameter by 2%  inches in height; color orange yellow ( Ridgway, orange buff to capucine  yellow) ; rind fairly smooth and thin ( about one- eighth inch), fairly free peel­ing  though not loose; oil cells numerous, very minute and flush with surface,  with some larger oil cells interspersed and slightly indented; segments 10 to  12, fairly large open core, one- half inch in diameter; seeds fairly numerous,  25 to 30, closely grouped at center, very small and slender, striate, with curved  beak and greenish cotyledons; pulp of pale amber color ( Ridgway, pale orange  yellow), very juicy, translucent, and tender, little fiber, sprightly, subacid  flavor, resembling the Thornton tangelo but when fUlly ripe having m0ge char­acter  than a fully ripe Thornton tangelo; pulp vesicles irregular in shape and  size and near the center more or less split open. Tree evergreen, vigorous, and  productive; leaves unifoliate, pointed oval, variable in shape. and size, small  to medium size ( averaging 2% to 3 inches long by 1% to I%, inches wide),  petioles very narrowly winged, occasionally without abscission joint.  There are some differences between the seedlings grown under  this number ( C. P. B. 1213- D) at Indio, showing that this tangelo,  unlike the Sampson and most of the citrus hybrids so far investigated,  does not come true from seed. In order to connect this new variety  with the parent tree producing the best fruit, it is here recorded that  the parent tree is No. 38 in row 7 of the citrus experimental planting  located at the United States Experiment Date Garden, Indio, Calif.  UMATILLA TANGELO  ( C. P. B. 112031- B- 2; pI. 8)  Closely resembling some of the tangelos in general appearance are  certain of the tangors, i. e., hybrids between mandarin oranges ( Oit­1'  US nobilis) and the common sweet orange ( 0. sinensis). The re­semblance  is so close that for horticultural purposes these tangors  may well be discussed with the tangelo group, a class of fruits now  fairly well recognized by citrus growers and rapidly acquiring mar­ket  recognition.  Of special interest and promise is a fruit resulting from the pol­lination  of a Satsuma orange with pollen of the Ruby orange ( some- 	asm0188000007																	2009-05-19	2009-05-19	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/wtswingle/id/94	94	95.pdfpage	/wtswingle/image/95.pdfpage
Page 24																										12 CIRCULAR 181, U. S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE  times called Ruby Blood). This cross was made in the spring of  1911 at Eustis, Fla. Hybrids of this group have been fruiting for  several years at Eustis, and one has attracted special attention be­cause  of its larg- e, deep- colored, glossy fruit of attractive appearance  and good holdmg quality. In contrast with the parents ( the Sat­suma,  early maturing, and Ruby, midseason), this hybrid is decidedly  a late fruit, maturing in late February, March, and ~\. pril, about the  season of the King orange. It resembles the latter in shape and  size, although it is much more attractive in appearance. The tree so  strongly resembles the ordinary Satsuma in foliage and habit that  but for the unique character of the fruit doubt might be raised as  to its hybrid origin. The name Umatilla ( Um- a- til'la) has been  selected for this new fruit, after the town of that name in Lake  County, Fla. For horticultural convenience it is classed with the  tangelos.  Technwa~ description.- Fruit the size and shape of a large Satsuma or King  orange, flattened at base and apex but without depression, size 3~ to 4%,  inches in transverse diameter ' by Z% to Z%, inches high; calyx small, persistent,  shallow grooves radiating from calyx attachment; color reddish orange  ( Ridgway, orange chrome), rind of medium thickness ( one- eighth to  three- sixteenths inch), firm, somewhat free peeling though not of pro­nounced  kid- glove character; smooth and glossy despite slight indentations  due to small, depressed oil cells; segments usually 10, separating easily,  with thin segment walls; open core with slight quantity of fibrous tissue  or rag; pulp tender and melting, translucent, very juicy, flavor rich and  vinous with a blending of high acidity and sweetness somewhat resembling  the King orange, pleasant aroma, large vesicles, color of pulp resembling  orange ( Ridg,,' ay, mikado orange); seeds variable but a, eraging one  to a segment ( some fruits entirely seedless), large and plump, greenish in  cross section, like Satsuma. Tree of rather slow growth and spreading, with  open top like Satsuma, fairly productive; leaves long- pointed oval, strongly  veined, · dark green, thick and leathery, with practicall~' wingless petioles,  resembling Satsuma.  A sister hybrid ( C. P. B. 52031- 0- 2) closely resembles the Uma­tilla  tangelo in fruit and tree characters, but its fruit is usually too  acid for consumption until about a month after the Umatilla becomes  palatable. Neither fruit shows any indication of drying out after  reaching maturity, although the rind is very thin.  Until given further tests on different ' stocks for growth, vigor.  and productivity, the Umatilla tangelo is not recommended for  large- scale planting; but it is well worthy of a place in the home  fruit garden and in plantings designed to supply luxury fruits to  a private trade.  HYBRIDS SERVING AS SUBSTITUTES FOR LIMES AND LEMONS  The need for hardy and disease~ resistant " ade" fruits similar  to the lime and the lemon has led to making numerous crosses in  which common varieties of both lime and lemon have been utilized in  combination with hardy and disease- resistant citrus varieties and  ? pecies.  One group of these hybrids, the limequats, has been discussed in  a previous paper, in which three varieties- the Eustis, Lakeland.  and Tavares- were described in detail ( 9). In producing these  hybrids the common West Indian lime ( Oitrus aJUrantifolia) was  pollinated with pollen from two species of the kumquat ( F01, twnella  margarita and F. japonica). 	asm0188000007																	2009-05-19	2009-05-19	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/wtswingle/id/95	95	96.pdfpage	/wtswingle/image/96.pdfpage
Page 25																										Since the publication of the paper mentioned above, the Eustis  limequat has been propagated and planted in home fruit gardens  in Florida and in the other Gulf States and has fulfilled all expecta­tions  as to hardiness and disease resistance. The limequats are to  all practical purposes hardy limes, but with the added advantage  that the hybrid has proved immune to lime withertip, a specific  lime disease caused by a parasitic fungus ( Gloeosporium li'fnetti­colu1n  Clausen) ( 2) to which the pollen parent ( Fortunella  japonica) is immune. The severity of this disease, especially in  humid regions and in seasons of high rainfall, seriously reduces  the vigor of the trees and causes great crop losses, so that an immune  variety having much the same flavor has distinct economic promise.  The relative vitamin value of the hybrid as compared with the  common lime is likewise a matter of importance and is now being  investigated. The lime, as is now well known, has the lowest vita­min  value of any citrus fruit, notwithstanding its traditional use on  old sailing vessels as a preventive of scurvy. The so- called" lime  juice" served as a ration to the crews of vessels on long cruises was  not, however, the juice of the · West Indian lime, but a mixture of  lemon juice and juice of the so- called sweet lime. So much a part  of the regimen was the serving of this juice on British vessels that  they earned the sobriquet of " lime juicers." The substitution of  juice from the · West Indian variety of lime under the mistaken no­tion  that it was identical in its properties with the juice of Mediter­ranean  limes and lemons led to several deaths from scurvy, seriously  handicapping an important expedition to the Arctic regions- the  Nares expedItion of 1875- 76 ( 1).  The limequat has evinced an adaptability to a wider range of  conditions than the true lime, not only thriving in regions much too  cold for the common lime, but proving well adapted to growth in  such widely divergent climates as the hot desert valleys of south­eastern  California and the humid tropical lowlands of Honduras  and Panama. Although the limequat proved sufficiently hardy to  overwinter for a number of normal years in northern Florida and  the other Gulf States, the severe freeze of 1924 practically killed out  the lime~ uats planted in this territory, indicating the need for a still  hardier' ade" fruit for this and similar marginal citrus zones.  NEW CITRUS HYBRIDS 13  A CALAMONDIN HYBRID  GLEN CITRANGEDIN  ( C. P. B. 48045; pI. 9)  The ealamondin ( Oit1"' lM mitis Blanco) has proved to be a surpris­ingly  hardy citrus species, especially in view of its native habitat,  the Philippine Islands. The tree is vigorous and productive; the  small red acid fruits, of kid- glove character, are decidedly ornamen­tal;  and the fruits make an acceptable substitute for limes or lemons  in regions that are much too cold to grow those fruits. The cala­mondin,  however, is not entirely hardy in northern Florida and in  the Gulf coast regions farther west, such freezes as occurred in 1924  almost annihilating existing plantings. Moreover, young trees are  often injured by temperatures of about 20° F., which are not un­common  in these regions. 	asm0188000007																	2009-05-19	2009-05-19	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/wtswingle/id/96	96	97.pdfpage	/wtswingle/image/97.pdfpage
Page 26																										14 CIRCULAR 181, U. S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE  The calamondin has been utilized in a number of hybrids, the most  promising of them being one in which it was pollinated with pollen  of the Willits citrange. This citrange, which has been previously  described ( 14, 15), is itself a hybrid, resulting from pollinating the  Japanese trifoliate orange ( POnci'rU8 trifoliata) with pollen of the  common sweet orange ( Oitl'u8 sinensis). The citranges as a class are  , the hardiest of all evergreen citrus varieties or hybnds, but the fruit  usually retains an objectionable quantity of musky oil, derived from  the trifoliate parent, that necessitates special precautions in using the  rather acid fruits :£ 01' " ade " or preserves. Most 0:£ the hybr, ids in  which the citrange has been utilized have traces 0:£ this flavor- much  reduced, however, as in the Thomasville citrangequat ( 9), a hybrid  of the oval kumquat ( Fortwnellamargarita) and the Willits citrange.  By hybridizing the Willits citrange with the calamondin, however, a  fruit has been produced that is fully as hardy as the citrange parent  but entirely free from the pungent oil usually associated with hybrids  0:£ tri:£ oliate orange ancestry. The tree, however, so closely resembles  the common calamondin that some doubt might be raised as to the  hybrid nature of the plant but for the occurrence 0:£ tri:£ oliate leaves,  especially in the juvenile stages, combined with much greater hardi­ness  and greater vigor 0:£ growth, as compared with the ordinary  calamondin.  This hybrid was the result of a cross- pollination made by the senior  writer in the spring of 1909 at Glen St. Mary, Fla. Mature trees  have been :£ ruiting with great regularity at Glen St. Mary for some  years past and have survived freezes that severely injured the ordi­nary  calamondin and the limequat. More than 100 miles farther  north, at McRae, Ga., this hybrid has also fruited well, and the :£ ruit  has been reported as acceptable at the local soda fountains :£ 01' use  in preparing " limeade," which can scarcely be distinguished from  the true limeade.  As this fruit originated at Glen St. Mary, where it has long been  fruiting, it is proposed to call it the Glen cltrangedin.  Tech1llical aesoription.- Fruit somewhat variable in size, oblate'spheroid, 1¥ S  to 1~ inches in transverse diameter by 1 to 11,4 inches high, small per­sistent  calyx set in slight depression, minute nipple at pistil end; color deep  reddish orange ( Ridgway, cadmium orange); rind thin and firm ( one­eighth  inch in thickness), not as free peeling as the calamondin and some­what  coarser, smooth and glossy, except for slight indentations due to  numerous minute oil- eell depressions; segments 6 to 8, separating easily;  small solid core; pulp juicy, tender, and translucent, very sharply acid but with­out  trace of the repugnant oil usually encountered in hybrids of the trifoliate  orange, color of pulp orange yellow ( Ridgway cadmium yellow) ; seeds small  and plump, 3 to 5, some fruits seedless. Tree evergreen, of vigorous upright  habit, highly ornamental, especially when bearing a crop of bright- colored fruits;  leaves usually unifoliate, occasional bifoliate and trifoliate leaves appearing,  dark green, glossy, 1* to 2* inches in length, long- pointed oval, petiole nar­rowly  winged and long in comparison with leaf size.  The tree has the habit, more pronounced than in the true calamondin, of  bearing its fruit in clusters at the ends of long slender branches, bending the  tree over with the weight of the fruit.  In regions too cold for growing the limequat or the ordinary cal­amondin  with sa:£ ety, this hardy fruit, the Glen citrangedin, offers  an attractive and useful substitute. It is, of course, chiefly of service  in preparing" ades" and in flavoring, much as lemons or limes are  used. When not intended for immediate use, the fruit should be 	asm0188000007																	2009-05-19	2009-05-19	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/wtswingle/id/97	97	98.pdfpage	/wtswingle/image/98.pdfpage

The tree is more or less everbearing, although the bulk of the fruit  matures in the late summer and fall months. Owing to its small  size, the fruit freezes at temperatures only slightly below freezing,  so it can not be held on the trees over winter in cold sections. Most  of the trees thus far fruiting have been budded on the trifoliate­orange  stock, and this doubtless has added to their hardiness. The  tree should be grown on this stock or on the hybrid citrange in the  colder sections of the Gulf coast and coastal- plams area of the South.  Like the true calamondin, this new fruit has value as an ornamental  when grown as a dwarf or potted plant.  A LEMON- LIME HYBRID  PERRINE LEMON  ( C. r. B. 48848; pI. 10)  Lemon culture has never been an important part of fruit growing  in Florida, several factors contributing to the failure of lemons  to succeed as a marketable crop under conditions there. A lead­ing  factor is that Florida lemons grow too big and coarse by the  time they are ripe enough to pick. For marketing purposes lemons  are picked by size, usually green, and cured to a proper color in  special curing rooms before shipment. Under Florida conditions  the lemon commonly reaches the desired market size when it is still  too immature to be a desirable fruit, lacking both juice and flavor.  Of equal importance is the extreme susceptibility of the common  lemon to citrus scab, which reduces the yield and lowers the grade of  the fruit. It is especially difficult and expensive to control this dis­ease  on lemons. As a result, lemons are frequently scarce in Florida,  imported Sicilian lemons in part supplving the deficiency during the  greater part of the year. Several ha; dy substitutes for the lemon  that are of much merit are gradually coming into cultivation, such  as the Eustis limequat and the Meyer Chinese lemon ( 4) ( a hardy  type probably of hybrid origin) ; but there is still a demand for a  lemon that can be grown in the warmer parts of Florida for local  use, if not as a shipping crop.  Hybrids between the Mexican lime ( Oitrus aurantifolia ( Christm.)  Swingle) and the Genoa lemon ( 0. limo'Tlfia Osbeck), made by the  senior writer in 1909, have been fruiting for several years in Florida  and give promise of meeting local needs. Although the Mexican  lime was used in these crosses as the female parent, the fruits are  more like a true lemon in appearance. The pulp in color, texture,  and, to a less extent, in flavor shows the influence of the pollen  parent. One of these hybrids in particular ( C. P. B. 48848) is  decidedly lemonlike in character and has been selected for propaga­tion  and planting. Despite its hybrid character ( being technically  a " lemon- lime"), its close resemblance to the lemon justifies its  being treated horticulturally as a new variety of lemon. As this  fruit has especial promise for the warm region of the lower east  coast of Florida, where it first fruited at Little River, it is proposed  to name it in honor of the pioneer horticulturist of this region, 	asm0188000007																	2009-05-19	2009-05-19	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/wtswingle/id/100	100	101.pdfpage	/wtswingle/image/101.pdfpage

DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE  Henry Perrine, to whom Congress in 1838 made a large grant of  land for planting to tropical plants, and who is reputed, among  many other introductions, to have planted seed of the Mexican lime  on several of the Florida keys, the beginning of the so- called wild  lime groves of this region. This new fruit, a hybrid between the  lime he introduced and the lemon, is therefore named the Perrine  lemon.  ' Teolznical description..- Fruit, size and shape of ordinary lemon, although  somewhat variable, average fruit 2%, to 3 inches in length by 214 to 2%, inches  in diameter, having abrupt protnberances surrounding calyx and small nipple  at blossom end characteristic of lemon; pistil often persistent; color pale lemon  yellow ( Ridgway barium yellow to pale lemon- yellow) ; rind thin and tough,  one- eighth inch, fairly smooth, slightly corrugated or wrinkled; segments  10 to 12: small solid core, thin segment walls, , esicles very small and tender;  pulp very juicy and translucent, of pale greenish yellow color ( Ridgway pale  dull green- yellow), su~ gesting lime; flavor more like lemon than lime, sharply  acid with no " off flavor" or after taf'te; seeds variable in number, usually  4 to 6, sometimes up to 12, slender and long pointed; tree evergreen, vigorous,  productive, and precocious; of rather compact habit, resembling the lime in  this respect rather than the lemon; leaves unifoliate, large ( 3 to 5 inches in  length), pointed oval, with short wingless petiole, resembling the lemon leaf.  The tree is much more hardy than the lime and appears somewhat hardier  than the common lemon; more or less everbearing, having ripe fruit, fruit in  all stages of development, and newly opened flowers at the same time. Juice  is developed while the fruit is still green and immature, in which respect it  resembles the lime. The fruit, like the lime, when fUlly ripe drops to the  ground.  Outstanding in its benavior under Florida conditions is its resist­ance,  if not complete immunity, to two of the worst diseases that  attack, respectively, the lime and the lemon- lime withertip ( 93)  and citrus scab ( 3,16,17). In April, 1930, experiments were con­ducted  at the United States Citrus Disease Field Laboratory, Or­lando,  Fla., under the direction of H. R. Fulton, to determine the  reaction of the Perrine lemon to lime withertip. The report of H. E.  Stevens, who made these tests, is as follows:  Attempts were made to induce withertip on 12 young growing shoots. Active  withertip- infected shoots from Key limes were placed in contact with the  above under conditions favorable for the disease to develop, but no infections  were obtained on any of the shoots so treated.  Under conditions extremely favorable to scab infection, no scab  has thus far appeared on fruit or foliage of the Perrine lemon.  Inoculation experiments are in progress to test further this apparent  immunity. Freedom from both these diseases constitutes an asset of  extreme importance in attempting to grow a fruit of this character  in southern Florida, where the high temperatures and humidity are  favorable to their spread and render their control difficult and costly.  This combination of characters is doubtless due to the fact that the  common lemon is immune to lime withertip ( 93) and the Mexican  lime is immune to citrus scab ( 16, 17), the hybrid inheriting both  immunities.  The acid content of the fruit 5 has been found to be 6.39 per cent  as compared with 5.17 per cent in the Villa Franca lemon and 6.89  per cent in the Key ( Mexican) lime, these percentages representing  content of anhydrous citrus acid.  • Determined and reported by B.

Page 31																										NEW CITRUS HYBRIDS 17  A sister hybrid, C. P. B. 48839, closely resembles the Perrine lemon  in fruit and tree characters, but the fruit shows more influence of  the lime parent and is often so asymmetrical in shape as to be poorly  adapted to packing. The tree, however, has the open habit of the  lemon rather than the compact habit of the lime, a disadvantage  from the cultural viewpoint, and likely to make it less resistant to  cold. Both of these fruits, however, are well adapted, t() th~ home  fruit garden in the warmer parts of Florida. .  SUMMARY  The tangelos and one related fruit ( called tangor) represent a new  type of orangelike citrus fruits having very high quality combined  in many cases with extremely attractive appearance. Despite the  fact that tangelos have been created by hybridizing tangerine  oranges with different varieties of grapefruit, the resulting hybrids  do not resemble their parent species as much as they do oranges; in  fact, they seem very much like some new and superlatively excellent  varieties of oranges rather than like hybrids of tangerines and  grapefruits.  Tangelos are usually characterized by extremely soft and melting  pUlp of very fine flavor, frequently with a special and often pleasing  aroma which makes them highly prized by those who have had an  opportunity to test them.  The soft and melting pulp of the tangelo in many cases causes the  fruit to break down rapidly when shipped to distant markets. The  rind of some varieties is so thin and tender as to be poorly adapted  for handling by the ordinary packing- house method. This objection  is largely overcome in several of the new tangelos herein described.  The extremely high- flavored and abundant juice of many tangelos  makes them especially well adapted for use as juice fruits, either by  themselves or blended with orange or grapefruit juice. · Without  doubt, tangelos are destined to become lIDportant for use as juice  fruits, especially for local markets in regions visited by winter  tourists.  Some of the tangelos are of such beautiful appearance and have  such exquisite flavor and pleasing aroma that they constitute luxury  fruits of the first order and as such justify the extra expense of spe­cial  handling while being picked, packed, and shipped to distant  markets. Such fruits can not be sold at a profit except at a much  higher price than ordinary oranges.  Although tangelos are extremely promising for the home fruit  garden in citrus- growing States and may ultimately be shipped on  a small scale to luxury markets in distant cities, it is not advisable  at present to make extensive plantings of them, on account of the  difficulty of marketing these new fruits to advantage in car- lot ship­ments.  The Glen citrangedin, obtained by hybridizing the · Willits citrange  with the calamondin, is a remarkable new acid fruit which combines  to a large extent the extreme hardiness of the citrange parent with  the high acidity and excellent flavor of the calamondin. It has been  grown successfully as far north as McRae ( latitude 32°), in southern 	asm0188000007																	2009-05-19	2009-05-19	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/wtswingle/id/102	102	103.pdfpage	/wtswingle/image/103.pdfpage

Unlike the citrange, the Glen citrangedin has a sharp acid flavor  without a trace of the repellent bitter flavor carried by oil globules  in the interior of the pulp vesicles of the citrange. It is not only  ~ n excellent " ade" fruit for home use and for local markets, but  also has high ornamental value if grown as a dwarf or potted plant.  On account of its extreme hardiness it should be tested throughout  the warmer parts of the Gulf coast and also in southern and south­eastern  Georgia, southern Texas, and J? ossibly in the cooler irri­gated  valleys of Arizona where lemons, hmes, and even limequats do  not succeed.  The lemon- lime hybrid, called the Perrine lemon, was originated  by crossing the common Mexican lime with the ordinary lemon. It  is more like a lemon than a lime in appearance, but unlike the true  lemon it does not grow to large size and become coarse and puffy  when grown in Florida. It has thus far proved highly resistant,  if not completely immune, to two major diseases, lime withertip  and citrus scab. The Perrine lemon is suitable for culture in south­ern  Florida and possibly in home fruit gardens in the warmer parts  of Louisiana and southern Texas. It is apparently hardier than  either the West Indian lime or the common lemon.  Neither of the citrus fruits serving as substitutes for limes and  lemons is recommended for large- scale commercial culture at the  present time, but both should be tested in the home garden.

Only in this  way may investigators avail themselves of disease resistance or other  special advantages acquired through ages of evolutionary progress.  The dangers attending the introduction of foreign plants have  become so patent in recent years that it may well cause us to pause  to count the cost and consider whether the benefits sought are com­mensurate  with the risk involved. Numerous as are the pests already  lodged with us as a result of miscellaneous unsupervised plant intro­ductions,  others even more threatening are known to exist in for­eign  countries. If we are to continue the introduction of foreign  plants so necessary for study, testing, and breeding purposes, it is  apparent that improved technique must be employed~ n the handling  of such introductions.  65562- 24  2 Department Circular 299, U. S. Dept. of Agriculture.  At the Toronto meeting of the American Society of Agronomy,  held December 29, 1921, Dr. Karl F. Kellerman presented a paper 1  detailing some of the precautions considered important in handling  imported citrus plants to guard against introducing dangerous new  , pests a. nd diseases. Special equipment for greenhouses intended for  growing citrus plants in quarantine and special procedure in han­dling  such plants were described and emphasized as requisite precau­tionary  measures. The equipment and procedure for handling citrus  plants have been further developed and perfected since that date,  so that it seems desirable to record and describe the methods at  present followed in the citrus quarantine house of the United States  Department of Agriculture.  While the procedure for handling citrus plants is perhaps more  rigorous than would commonly be thought necessary, in essential  outlines it is easily adaptable; and the equipment, especially as it  guards against insect or fungous infestation, could readily be ap­plied  to any well- built greenhouse. The illustrations accompanying  this circular will assist in making this plain.  PROTECTION BY F, UMIGATION AND SPRAYING.  About 1911, following a program drawn up by the senior writer,  a concerted effort was made to grow citrus plants in the Washington  greenhouses free from the attacks of insects, such as ants, red spiders.  scale, mealybug, and mites. The program included fumigation twice  each month and careful inspection of plants, with occasional spray  applications.  In practice, this system gave a considerable measure of relief from  damage, but eradication was not complete, and the treatments were  sometimes necessarily so drastic as to injure the plants. Ants in  particular were able to escape the effect of fumigation by nesting in  the soil. With them the eggs and larval of other pests were doubtless  preserved. .  In addition to the actual damage caused by insects, it was appar­ent  that insects, particularly ants, are the active spreaders of fungous  and bacterial diseases. Therefore it was finally realized that the  greenhouse must be so constructed that it would be insect proof.  PROTECTION THROUGH SPECIAL DEVICES FOR THE EXCLUSION  OF INSECTS.  The first step in providing equipment for protecting the citrus  plants grown in the greenhouse from insect attacks was · the con­struction  of a propagating bed for growing citrus seedlings. This bed  was of ' sheet- metal construction and was surrounded by a water­filled  trough or moat, primarily intended to exclude ants. The suc­cess  of this device, which was first used in experimental greenhouse  work by Dr. K. F. Kellerman in 1906, encouraged more complete  efforts at protecting the greenhouse benches.  A further advance in the campaign was made in 1915 when a  screened cage was built in the end of one of the greenhouses, the bot­tom  and sides being made entirely of metal, like a huge pan, and a  1 Kellerman, Karl F., and Swingle, Walter ' l'.

I.- Screened detention cage surrounded by an oil moat.  moat for holding water- or oil provided entirely around the cage.  This was designed as a detention cage to separate any suspicious  plants from the rest of the greenhouse. Figure 1 shows how this  screened cage looks in actual use.  Later, tlus cage was found of service as a temporary detention  compartment for plants which had passed through the regular quar­antine  procedure put into practice as a result of the menace of citrus  canker.  Procedure to Safeguard Citrus Plants. 3  In 1916 the interception of some imported citrus budwood of a  suspicious character but of a promising new variet~ made it neces­sary  to provide a propagating house entirely removed from all other  citrus plants. Accommodations were secured through cooperative  arrangement with the Bureau of Animal Industry oI). ( he grounds of  its station at Bethesda, Md., near Washington, D. C., and a small  temporary glass- toofed shed was erected for use in propagating im­ported  citrus plants. This first house was only 12 feet long by 6  feet wide and 4f feet high. It was heated by gas. thermostatically  4 Department Circular 299, U. S. Dept. of Agriculture.  controlled, using a hot- water coil. As the first plants grown here  were from citrus- canker territory, great precautions were observed in  FIG. 2.- End view of the citrus quarantine greenhouse at Bethesda, Md. This is the  receiving end, or isolation ward. The exterior oil moat is attached to the foundation  wall just beiow the sill.  the sterilization of clothing and tools, and a system of aseptic propa­gation  was gradually evolved.  In 1918 a small but well- equipped greenhouse was built at Bethesda,  taking the place of the temporary propagating shed just described  and providing more adequate space for both plants and workers.  Views of this house are shown in Figures 2 and 3. The original  FIG. 3.- Citrus quarantine greenhouse, showing ~ ll openings screened and entra nces pro­tected  lJy a circumferentiai 011 moat.  propagation shed is shown in Figure 4. The greenhouse is approxi­mately  35 feet long by 20 feet wide, with a service room 10 by 20  Procedure to Safeguard Citrus Plants. 5  feet. It is divided into two sections, the end section serving as a  receiving room, or isolation ward, for newly imported plants ( fig. 2).  In this greenhouse were incorporated all the insect- proof devices that  had previously been tested and fo. und satisfactory and a number of  new ones.  OIL CUPS.  At this time Dr. B. T. Galloway and Edward Goucher, who had  been working along similar lines for the control of insects in the  Federal Horticultural Board greenhouse, perfected an oil cup de­signed  to be attached to the supporting legs of the greenhouse benches,  which was effective in keeping crawling insects from gaining access  to the bench proper.  This device, saucer shaped, was cast in molds, with an opening in  the center large enough to fit tightly over the pipe serving as a bench  l"/ G. 4.- 0riginal propagating shed temporarily used as a quarantine greenhouse for  plants originating in the citrus- canker territory of the Orient.  leg to which it was to be attached. As castings could not always  be obtained promptly, a similar cap was designed by Eugene May,  jr., using heavy galvanized sheet metal and soldering this to a metal  sleeve to slip snugly over the iron pipe used as a support for the  bench. Any packing necessary wai3 saturated with oil to repel in­sects  that might try to elude the oil cup itself. These sheet- metal  cups were used on the bench supports of the new quarantine green­house  at Bethesda.  This form of oil cup can be made by any sheet-~ etal worker at  small expense and can be attached to benches already in service with­out  necessitating any changes in construction. The cup is shown  in Figure 5.  A heavy oil, such as cup grease, can be used in such cups to ad­vantage,  as the evaporation is negligible and there is less likelihood  6 Department Circular 299, U. S. Dept. of Agriculture.  of its being washed out in watering plants than when using a lighter  oil. An improved form of the cup with a projecting cover obviates  all danger of the oil being washed out, but this adds considerably to  the cost.  For such devices to be effective, the plant bench must be entirely  separated from the side walls of the greenhouse. In addition, at the  Bethesda greenhouse, screens have been put up along the backs of  , the benches ( fig. 6) to prevent the branches of growing plants from  touching the side wall of the house.  Ants will quickly take advantage of  any such bridge and find their way  to the bench.  CONCRETE FLOOR.  Floors were constructed entirely  of concrete. A concrete floor that  may be easily cleaned with a hose  and drained through an insect- proof  trap is a distinct advantage in keep­ing  the greenhouse free from crawl­ing  insects.  EXTERIOR OIL MOAT.  In quarantine work it is not only  essential to keep insects off the  benches, but the escape of any that  may gain entrance to the greenhouse  with imported plants must be pre­vented.  To make doubly sure of  safety on this score, the citrus quar­FIG.  5.- Metal oil cup attached to the antine house, at the suggestion of  leg ot a greenhouse bench to prevent Doctor Irellel'man was provided the access of crawllng insects. .)..,  with an oil moat or trouO" h that ex-tends  entirely around it, about a foot above the ground ( figs. 2 and  3). The U- shaped trough was fastened to the cement foundation  wall by means of expansion bolts, a piece of oil- soaked felt packing  between the wall and the trough effectively preventing any insects  from eluding the oil barrier. A removable cover ( fig. 7) permits  inspection and cleaning and excludes rainwater, while it prevents  sticks or other trash from accumulating and bridging the barrier.  The oil moat shown in the illustration holds nearly a barrel of crude  oil and needs only occasional inspection to be fully effective.  SCREENED VENTILATORS.  The features already described eliminated danger from crawling  insects, but the flying ones remained to be considered. Doors were,  of course, easily screened, but the ventilators offered a difficult prob­lem.  owing to the arms by which they are operated. An ingenious  device of simple constrnction was finally invented 2 consisting of a  2 Patent No. 1,402,241, issued Jan. 3. 1922, to Eugene May, jr.. Robert J. Bullen, and  AUj!; ust Voight, assistants in the plant- propagation work of the Office of Crop Physiology  and Breeding Investigations.  Procedure to Safeguard Citrus Plants. 7  sliding gasket fastened to the screen wire, which permits the oper­ating  arm to pass through the screen with a free movement and yet  leaves no opening for the entrance of insects ( fig. 8).  A Government patent covering this invention has been taken out,  which renders it available without the payment of royalties to those  who may wish to use it in making greenhouses insect ! proof. The de­tail  drawings ( fig. 9) and descriptive text will explain haw this de­vice  is constructed. In the first models the gasket was held in place  by metal straps which were soldered to the sliding member, but this  attachment is now made secure by the use of small screw bolts, which  facilitate the replacing of the gaskets when necessary.  The device consists of a ventilator arm ( it) of ordinary type and  a trap, as shown in Figure 9. The trap consists of a body of sheet  metal the ends of which are folded over ( D) about 1 inch, forming  an envelope. Through the body a rectangular opening, about 3 by 2  FlO. 6.- Interior of citrus quarantine greenhouse, showing metai construction and screen  at the back of the bench to prevent the growing piants from touching the side wall.  inches, is provided. Over this opening is placed a felt gasket with  a slot in the center, the gasket being fastened by straps held in place  by screw bolts or soldered to a flat piece of metal also ! provided with  a slot in the center suitable in size ~ nd shape to accommodate the  yentilator arm. This piece of metal is free to slide in the outer  envelope body, allowing free movement of the ventilator arm. One  of the ends of the body is bent down at an angle and holes are pro­yided  for fastening it to the greenhouse header or roof. . At the  upper end the body is soldered to the wire screen through which a  slit is provided to permit the passage of the ventilator arm. Thus  the ventilator opening is completely screened, preventing the access  of insects when the ventilators are raised.  Another unique feature of the equipment in the lYethesda quaran­tine  greenhouse is an automatic ventilating apparatus opened and  closed by a series of thermostats which actuate a reversible electric  motor. This was suggested by Eugene May, jr., and devised by  8 Department Circular 299, U. S. Dept. of Agriculture.  Harry Stevens, an electrical engineer of Washington, D. C. After  some modifications and improvements now under way it is believed  that this system of ventilation control may have wide application in  greenhouse work. For quarantine houses,' it obviates the necessity  for frequent isits by workmen, with the attendant dangers of carry-  , ing infections.  The heating plant is also controlled by a thermostat of the ordi­nary  commercial type, which is economical and likewise reduces to a  minimum visits on the part of attendants. It may be said, in this  connection, that only authorized attendants are allowed access to this  quarantine greenhouse, which is kept locked at all times.  PLANT CAGES.  If only one lot of plants at a time were to be handled in quarantine,  the problem would be comparatively simple; but different lots often  FIG. 7.- 0il moat surrounding the citrus qnarantine greenhouse, with a section of the  cover removed for inspection.  from widelJl different parts of the world must be handled at the same  time. These different lots of plants must, of course, be protecteu  from each other. This difficulty is met by growing each importa­tion  first in a separate screened cage located in the isolation ward of  the quarantine greenhouse.  The cages now in use ( fig. 10) are a recent invention. They are  constructed entirely of metal, ,: ach provided with an oil moat, and  so put together that by removmg ' a few thumbscrews they can be  . taken apart and thoroughly sterilized before being used a second  time.  The wooden cages formerly used had to be burned, as soon as they  had served for a single lot of plants, to guard against carrying over  pome hidden pest. This was expensive and at the same time left  open a chance that some new wood- destroying fungus might gain a  foothold by producing spores before the cage was finally destroyed  by burning.  f  Procedure to Safeguard Citrus Plants. 9  The detail drawings ( figs. 11, 12, and 13) show the method of con­struction  of this all- metal, knockdown, insect- free cage specially  designed for quarantine use. Those now in use were constructed in  the mechanical shops of the United States Department of Agricul­ture,  where many of the details of construction were igeniously  ''' orked out.  BENCHES.  " Woodwork that is subject to decay and offers abundant places of  concealment for insects has been avoided as far as possible in the  construction of greenhouse benches. The benches in use ( fig. 6)  have metal sides and sectional tile bottoms. This type of construc-  FIG.

The ventilator at the left is closed; that at the right,  open.  tion permits thorough sterilization by live steam if necessary and  is economical because the materials used are practically indestruc­tible.  PROPAGATION.  The foregoing descriptions cover chiefly the mechanical features  found vitally important in growing citrus plants in quarantine so as  1.0 render them, or rather plants propagated from them, safe for  later trial in citrus- growing territory. The propa~ tion methods  are fully as important.  Plant propagation must be carried ' on under conditions as nearly  aseptic as it is possible to make them. This involves disinfection  of clothing, tools, and person on each visit to the quarantine green­honse.  But the principal new feature in plant propagation evolved  10 Department Circular 299, U. S. Dept. of Agriculture.  during the past few years by the writers is the system of double  transfer of buds now practiced in handling imported citrus plants.  No part of an original imported plant is ever permitted to leave  quarantine alive. .  PLANT REGENERATION THROUGH THE DOUBLE TRANSFER OF  BUDS.

If this new  growth is found to  be entirely free from  infection or infesta­tion,  buds are trans­ferred  ( by budding  or grafting) to new  v i g 0 r 0 us, home­grown  stocks held in  the isolation ward  of the quarantine  greenhouse. When  these buds are safely  established, the orig­inal  plant and any  adhering soil are  put in a furnace and  totally destroyed or  sterilized. When the  newly budded plant  has made growth  sufficient to furnish  good budwood, a  second transfer is  made on new clean  stocks, and if no  disease has appeared  in the mea n tim e  these last buds are  admitted to the main  section of the quar­antine  greenhouse.  These first three  stages may take a  year or two, giving ample time in most cases for any latent disease  to make its appearance. Nevertheless, there are two more stages  before all quarantine restrictions are removed and the" regenerated"  plants are eligible for field trial.  RELEASE FROM QUARANTINE.  When released from the quarantine greenhouse ( and release is  made only on a certificate showing entire freedom from any sort  Procedure to Safeguard Citrus Plants. 11  of infestation), the plants are placed in a special screened compart­ment  in one of the Washington greenhouses. This compartment is  known as the" detention cage." When new growth has been made  here which proves clean, the plants are allowed a place on the main  bench of the greenhouse. Later they are repotted in freshly steril­ized  soil and are admitted to the main propagating house, when  they become eligible for field trial. This propagating hous(: is  likewise fully equipped with insect- proof devices, so that when plants  are finally ready for distribution they can be certified as entirely  free from infestation or infection. No plants are sent out except  when such a certificate can be given.  I!' IG. lO.- All- metal knockdown insect- free cages for growing recently imported citrus  plants in the isolation ward of the citrus quarantine greenhouse.  There are thus five stages with at least two transfers of budwood  before distribution. At anyone of these stages a suspicious plant  can be detected and destroyed. The same system in use for imported  plants is employed, with some modifications, for handling citrus  plants which it is desired to send from one State to another where  mutual quarantine exists. The original plants are not passed for  shipment, but newly propagated buds are sent out in such cases.  Cooperative agreements with State quarantine officials designate the  procedure to be followed in individual cases.  The procedure to be followed in handling imported citrus ma­terials  has been formulated into a set of regulations, a copy of which  is kept conspicuously posted in the citrus quarantine greenhouse.  These regulations are here summarized.  12 Department Circular 299, U. S. Dept. of Agriculture.  REGULATIONS.  SPECIAL PROCEDURE IN HANDLING. IMPORTED CITRUS PLANTS. SCIONS, AND  SEEDS.

IJcpa" lmelll or agrieullure, Washington, IJ. C.  Current theories of herediLy and variaLion give no meLhod of explaining  variations in firsL generaLion hybrids between pure bred parents.  It is genemlly assumed LhaL differences ill Lhe characLers of organisms arc  due Lo corresponding differences in the eomposiLion of Lhe gameLes Lhal uniLe  to form the individual organism. No doubL LhaL is tme in many cases, but iL is  my purpose Lo point ouL cases in , yhich Lhis assumpLion cannot be susLained.  Some fi rst generaLion hybrids show a very considerable range of varia Lion ,  far more than can possibly be accounLed for by any qualitative differences in Lhe  chromosomes or oLher bearers of herediLy received from the Lwo parenLs.  Inasmuch as during Lhe "' hole of the first ( or conjugate) generaLion Lhe  chromosomes from Lhe t\ Yo gameLes persist side by side in an unfused staLe,  such variations cannoL be due Lo any quanLitaLive differences in Lhe bearers of  herediLy possessed by the sistel' hybrids.  If proof can be given Lo show Lhat in cerLain specific cascs pairs of gametes  of identical hereditary composiLion give rise to very diverse organisms, the way  has been opened for a general reinvestigaLion of the validity of Oul' modern  Lheories of heredily.  Some years ago "' h\:, n I carried on breeding ,,' ork on maize in conjunction  wiLh my teachel', the laLe Prof. ' V. A. Kellerman, I was pl'Ofoundly impressed  by Lhe diversity ShO\ YIl in different planLs of first generation hybrids of idenLical  pure parenLage. Alllhe cars on a single plant, no mailer how many, were of  Lhe same general Lype, but those on other planLs descended from the same L,,' o  races were different, often very decidedly different. A considerable number of  hybrids showed this behavior!.  It must be remembered that such hybrids are made up of cells, Lhe nuclei  of which contain side by side Lhe identical chromosomes derived from the Lwo  parenLal gameLes. If Lhe parenLs are pure bred, all the first generation hybrids  w'e derived ( rom identical gametes cmd have an ident~ cal equipment o( chromo­somes".  Any difrercnccs obscrved beLwecn such hybrids must be due Lo difrerences  in the expr'ession of herediLary tendencies and noL due to differences in their  transmission Lo Lhe gameLes as Cook has poinLed ouL '.

The citl'emons, or crosses between the lemon and Cil1" us tTi( oliata, on the  contrary, show nearly 20 per cent of seedlings with an exaggerated development  of hypophylls and in the majOl'ity of cases never produce any normal foliage  leaves at all ( Fig. 5) dying from starvation shorLly aner the reserve food mate­rial  of the seed is used up. One parent, Citnts l1' i( oliata, has a few hypophylls  along the base of tbe stem of the young seedling ( Fig. 6), while the lemon, like  the orange and all other  common ci trous fruits,  sho, ys a pair of rather  large, rounded, sessile,  opposite leaves as the first  post- cotyledonary foliage.  Tbe excessive developmen t  of hypophylls represen ts  an intensification of one of  the parental characters.  Bcsides the seedlings  with hypophyIls, many of  the citremons show wide  variations in the character  of tbe leaves. Some show  five leaflels ( this occasio­nally  occms in citranges  also)', others show u ni fo­liale  leaves 01' leaves with  very much reduced side  Jeaflels ( Fig. 8) ( which is  rarely or never seen in ci­tranges).  " lost of the ci­trcmons  have trifoliate  leaves with large laleral  leaflets ( Fig. 9), which is  the type characteristic of  cilranges.  There arc several hun­dred  of these hybrids under  stuJy. Three yarieties of lemon, the Eureka, Villa Franca and Lisbon ( Fig. 10),  were used in cros~ ing with Cit1'/ l8 tl'i( oliata and all three yielJed a considerable  proportion of seedlings ( usually about one- fifth) with pronounced hypophylls.  As yet none of the citremons have borne fruit, so it is not possible 10 compare  the variations in the fruits with those of th'e leaves. Doubtless the striking fmit  variations shown by the citranges will be equaled or more probably exceeded by  the citremons, since the latter show a dccidedly greater range of foliar variation 2.

Collins and Kempton', in an nrticle presented to this congress,  havG given conclusive evidence of the varying hereditary nature of dill'erent  individual plants of first generation plants of maize, alLhough tbese difTerences  \ yere indicated by the nature of the endosperm iLself representing F2 , or the  pcrjugategeneration. A Chinese maizewith  a waxy endosperm was cro~ sed \\' jth Mexican  maize with a horny endosperm of the usual  type. The homy endosperm was dominanL  so all the kernels on the crossed cars sho\\' ed  the horny character. These kernels sowed  separately gave ri,; e to plants of the first  generation ( F I ) which \\' ere self- pollinated.  The resulLing cars shO\ yed varying percenta­ges  of kernels with a waxy endOSpel'l11 from  15.7 to 53.5, approaching nearly but not quite  to the expecLed Mendelian ratio 1- 5 ( being 25.' 1  instead of 25 per 100).  In as much as the ears contained a large  number of kernels there can be no doubt but  that their varying percentages represented  rcal difTerences in the hereditary composition  of the first generation plants. It would be  hard to find a more conclusive case since  there could be no doubt as to the purity of  the parents and whatis more rare no possible  doubt as to whether a given kernel had a  waxy or a horny endosperm.  Such variations among individuals of  first generation hybrids are not unknown to  students of genetics amI these phenomena  have been referred to variable dominance by  those who use the ~ Iendelian terminology.  It has not, however, been realizrd how fatal  this phenomenon is to some of Lhe chief te­neLs  ofmoa. ern theories of hered i Ly. Already  in J897 at the Ithaca meeting of the American  Association for the Advancement of Sciencp,  I called attention to this phcnoinenon and, to  account for it, proposed a provisional hypo-thesis  of \\" hich a summary was given in the following words:  " IL \\' as pointed out that \ Veismann's theory of reduction of chromosomes,  though giving a plausible explanaLion of the dj( Terences observed between the  first ( unil" orm) and second ( polymorphic) generations of most hybrids, is not  only in disaccord with the observed phenomena of spore and pollen formation  in higher plants. but fails to account 1" 01' the extreme polymoiphism often  ' 1.

The synapsis, however, is more or less  inperfect and the patemal and maternal idioplasmic particles may not, propel'ly  speaking, fuse or blend at all but go over more or less unmixed to the resuILing  gametes.

The third condition, probably normal in wild spceics, is that in which the  chromosomes freely interminglc at the moment offccundation, the configmation  they then takc on accidentally being pcrpetuated throughout the life of the  individual. Thc difl'crent chromosomcs exert varying degrees of influence on  the cell, depending on whether thcy arc lucated near the periphcry or near the  center of the nucleus' .  The following synopsis exhibits the three types of fccundation.  I. INTU1SPECIFIC IIYBI1IDS : Usually stCl'ile and intcrmediate.  Violent crossbrecding. Chromatic material tends to remain separate;  synapsis often impossible, resulLing in sterility.  II. MENDELIAN CROSSES: Usually intermcdiate, dialytic at synapsis.  Mendelism, crossing of inbred hybrids with imped'ect or false synapsis.  III. l\ ORMAL CROSS- Bl1ED sPEciES: Usually vigorous, fertile and variable.  Normal crossbreeding. Chromosomes frcely' intermingle at moment ot  fecundation and the configuration there taken persists through the ontogeny  of thc individual, giving great variety of forms. Synapsis normal.  As 10 the fact of considerable variations in first gencration hybrids of rela­Lively  stable species or races there can bc no doubt.  In the light of what has becn said above, it cannot be doubted that we have  in such variations a vital and important principle of heredity and one which  goes far to ~ xplain many obscure phenomena of the everyday cxpericnces of  animal and plant breeders.  The suggcstion, first made in ' 1897 and here rciterated, Lhat such variation  may, in part at least, be due to positional dif1' erences in the material bearers of  herediLary characters is of coursc merely a provisional hypoLhesis As such it  may prove hclpful in gelling a clear idca of the phenomena to be explained  even if it does not aid us materially in such an explanation.  Cook · has pointed out that this theory, of positional relations of the idio­plasmic  materials of the cell, puts a ncw rcsource in the hands of the evolu­tionist  in the study of the bafflingly complcx expression rclations of hereditary  chal'acters.  It is easy Lo see that if' ,,- e accept the hypothesis of thc positional relation  of chromosomes, a very large number of different forms could be expected to  occur among hybrids ' of Ihe same relatively pme- bred parents, In this \ Yay Lhe  practice of almost all successful plant breeders in selecting the best individuals  f'rom among a large numbcr of hybrids receives a new justification,  ] n order to have a name for this supposed positional influence of the  parcntal idioplasm in the cells of cl'Oss- bred individuals, I propose the term  ;:, ygotaxis.

SWINGI. E, Physiologist in Charge, and T. RAI. PH ROBINSON, Crop  Physiologist, Office of Crop Physiology and Breeding Investigations, Bureau of Plant  Industry, United States Department of Agriculture  The breeding of cold- resistant citrous fruits suitable for culture in  the southern part of the cotton belt has been in progress for many years.  The citrange, a cross of the hardy Chinese trifoliate orange, Poncirus  trifoliata ( L.) Raf. and the common sweet orange, Citnts sinensis, Osb.  was the first of the hardy hybrids secured. The citrange was first  reported on by the senior author and Dr. H. J. Webber2 in the Yearbook  of the Department of Agriculture for 1904, where the Rusk and Willits  citranges, two that appear below as parents of new hybrids, were de­scribed  and illustrated. It soon became evident that although the cit­range  is much like the trifoliate orange in its resistance to extreme cold  when it is in a dormant condition, it is easily forced. into a new growth  in spring and sometimes is severely injured by untimely cold snaps.  In consequence of this imperfect resistance of the citrange to spring  and early autumn frosts, about 15 years ago the effort was first made to  create new types of hybrids which would partake in some measure of  another type of hardiness possessed very strikingly by the kumquat  oranges. The kumquat is one of the hardiest of the evergreen citrous  fruit trees; besides having a fair degree of resistance to cold it has an  extremely high degree of winter dormancy. Both of the species of  kumquat commonly grown in this country, the round and the oval kum­quats,  are able to pass unaffected through speIls of hot weather which  force other citrous into a tender and succulent growth that is liable to be  injured by a slight frost.  The first successful hybrids wherein the kumquat was used with the  idea of securing increased dormancy were made by the senior author in  the spring of 1909. Four principal types of these kumquat hybrids  were made: First, those between the trifoliate orange and the kumquat.  These proved extraordinarily hard to make, and most of them were very  weak, many of them dying while still smaIl seedlings. None of these  have proved as yet to be of any considerable value. Second, hybrids  were made in considerable number between the more promising citranges,  especiaIly the Rusk and Willits, already widely cultivated in the cotton  belt, and the kumquats. The hybrids resulting from these crosses are  known as citrangequats, and are described in the present paper. Third,  the effort was made to hybridize the kumquat with the West India lime,  1 Accepted for publication Oct. 28, 1921.  '\ VEBBIlR. Herbert J .• and SWINGLIl, Walter T.

The evergreen nature of the tree  also recommends it for home gardens or lawn planting. Judicious  pruning or pinching back of long shoots will assist in giving the tree a  fairly compact habit in place of its natural upright form.  The Thomasville citrangequat makes an excellent marmalade without  the admixture of any other citrous fruits. The mildly pungent peel and  the pleasantly flavored acid juice combine to give the marmalade an  unusually good flavor, rivaling the best Dundee marmalade.  RESISTANCE TO DISEASE  The advent of Citrus- canker in the Gulf Coast States made it necessary  to test any new Citrus varieties and hybrids with reference to their sus­ceptibility  to that disease before they could be recommended for culture.  As is well known, the kumquat is the most canker- resistant of all  citrous fruits, its resistance amounting to practical immunity under  field conditions. In this new hybrid, the Thomasville citrangequat, the  kumquat parent has seemingly transmitted its remarkable canker resis­tance  unimpaired, notwithstanding the fact that one parent of the  citrangequat, the citrange, is decidedly susceptible to canker.  Several plants of the Thomasville citrangequat have been inoculated  and continuously exposed to Citrus- canker for a period of four years  without any canker having been developed except from needle punctures,  from which canker failed to spread. 5  It is highly important that only canker- resistant citrous fruits be propa­gated  in the Gulf Coast States west of Florida, as a measure of insurance  against a serious reinfection. From this viewpoint, the citrangequat  becomes of great importance to this region, to meet the need for home­grown  acid citrous fruits.  While somewhat affected by Citrus scab, the quality of the fruit is not  greatly impaired thereby, and if planted away from scab- susceptible  varieties it is probable that scab would not be at all serious on the citrange­quat.  POSSIBLE USE OF CITRANGEQUATS AS ASTOCK FOR SATSUMA ORANGES  The extraordinary vigor of growth, great hardiness, and extreme  canker resistance shown by this hybrid suggested at once its possible  value as a stock, especially for use in the Gulf Coast States west of Florida.  In this region almost the only stock used for Satsuma and other Citrus  varieties is t.. h. e trifoliate orange, a very hardy, deciduous tree, closely  related to the true species of Citrus. It is extremely thorny and is used  extensively as a hedge plant, the fruits from these hedges providing an  abundance of seeds to use in growing nursery stock. Unfortunately, the  trifoliate orange is very susceptible to Citrus- canker. One necessary step  in the eradication of canker is the complete elimination of these trifoliate  orange hedges. The presence of large numbers of trifoliate seedlings in  Citrus nurseries is also a menace in the event of a reappearance of Citrus­canker.  When considering the possible use of the citrangequat as a stock, the  small number of seeds produced seemed an almost unsurmountable  ~ PSL'I'I£ R. George L.

Jan. 27, 1923 Citrangequats and Limequats 233 I  barrier, despite its promising features of canker- resistance and extreme  vigor. 6 The recent discovery, however, that cuttings of the citrangequat  may be rooted readily by the use of new methods, has been so encouraging  that extended trials of this plant as a stock are now under way. By the  use of rooted cuttings, practically a full year's time may be saved in  growing stocks to budding size, an advantage certainly sufficient to  offset any additional trouble and expense for greenhouse equipment.  A combination of bottom heat, about 90° F, with humidity maintained  at a high point, 80° to 90°, and with air temperature lower than that of  the soil, 70° to 80°, is essential to the best results. 7 With good control  of all these factors, small twig cuttings with leaves attached may be rooted  within a few weeks- in less time, in fact, than it usually takes for seed  to germinate. .  Plate 3 shows two of these cuttings and the original seedling plants be­side  them, with the stubs visible where the cuttings were removed.  These cuttings were photographed only 4U months from the time they  were placed" in the rooting bed and are fine specimens of a large lot rooted  in February, 1921. The seedlings were 18 months old. An interesting  point in this connection is the fact that while the citrangequat roots so  freely the three parent species utilized in creating the hybrid ( the sweet  orange, trifoliate orange, and kumquat) commonly fail to root under the  same conditions.  By the use of rooted cuttings, certain advantages are secured well  worth consideration. First, the time saved has already been mentioned;  second, through vegetative propagation uniformity of vigor is secured  which is highly desirable and cannot ordinarily be expected through  the use of seedlings; and, third, it has often been noted in the propagation  of cross- bred plants that there is a vigor of growth in the first generation  seedlings not so apparent in succeeding generations of self- pollinated  plants. This vigor can be utilized to best advantage by the rooting of  cuttings from especially vigorous individuals.  Buds of Satsuma and other citrous fruits grow readily on citrangequat  stocks, but tests under field conditions will be necessary before definite  conclusions can be drawn. While such tests have been under way now  for several years, more time will be necessary in order to secure trust­worthy  conclusions as to the effect of the stock on the quality, size,  and season of fruit crops, as well as hardiness and other factors of practical  importance.  Regardless of the possible utilization of the Thomasville citrangequat  as a stock, its obvious value as a hardy, canker- resistant fruit tree for  home use makes it desirable to give it a distinctive name and publish  a detailed description.  • The character of this hybrid as regards seed content seems to be dependent largely on the possibility of  its receiving pollen from other seedy varieties of Citrus. In many places where grown by itself or along  with seedless varieties ( such as Satsuma, having little or no viable pollen) the fruit is practically seedless.  while in other plantings where mixed with seedy varieties, seeds are usually found averaging six or eight  to the fruit.  The Thomasville citrangequat. like many other hybrids between widely differing species of the Citrus  group, reproduces itself unchanged from seed. This means that it is in reality a,. sterile hybrid and the  embryo found in the seed is developed from the tissues of the mother plant and of c!! furse shows no effect 0 f  the pollen used in fertilizing the flower.  7 The method used was developed in January and February, 1921, by Mr. Eugene May, jr.. plant propa ·  gator of the Office of Crop Physiology and Breeding Investigations, and is an adaptation of the rooting  methods devised by Mr. Edward Goucher, of the Office of Foreign Seed and Plant Introduction, Bureau  of Plant Industry, United States Department of Agriculture, for the rooting of small twig cuttings of the  Lychee.

OTHER CITRANGEQUATS  During the spring and early summer of 19° 9, the senior author made  many cross pollinations between citranges and kumquats. From these  numerous crosses, 67 citrangequats were secured. These citrangequats  are mostly hybrids of the oval kumquat with the citrange, the latter  being the pollen parent. Five different citranges were used as pollen  parents, but most of the citrangequats ( 49 in all) have Rusk citrange  as the mother parent; the next largest group ( II in all) are hybrids  between the Willits citrange and the oval kumquat. Three of the  citrangequats are hybrids of the round kumquat pollinated by the Rusk  citrange.  Not all of the citrangequats have been as yet carefully studied, but a  number of them are of interest and several of the most promising are  noted below.  A second citrangequat ( C. P. B. No. 4801 I) was grown from the same  crossed fruit that yielded the Thomasville. It differs from that variety  in having large fruits more nearly spherical in shape and borne on upright  fruit stalks instead of on curiously elongated " goose- neck" fruit stalks.  This citrangequat, like the Thomasville, loses much of its acidity as the  fruit matures and like it has a mild- flavored peel and usually few seeds.  When fully ripe this citrangequat is sweeter than the Thomasville and  can be eaten from the hand by those who like rather sour citrous fruits.  Another citrangequat resulting from the same cross of oval kumquat  and Willits citrange is C. P. B. No. 48005. The pollen parent was the  same as that of the Thomasville but the seed parent was a different  tree growing in the same dooryard at Eustis, Fla. This citrangequat  has attracted attention by fruiting freely in the garden of Mr. George  H. Harris, a cooperator living at McRae, Telfair County, Ga., far to  the north of the limit of ordinary citrous fruit culture.  It differs decidedly from the Thomasville in remaining intensely acid  even when fully mature. The fruits are nearly spherical and are borne  on erect fruit stalks. As this citrangequat has fruited successfully as  far north as the latitude of Savannah, 32°, it seems advisable to give it a  8 RIDGWAY, Robert. COLOR STAND.\ RD3 AND COLOR NOMENCLATURE, pl.

B. No. 48007,  which was conspicuous for its extreme vigor when young. ( PI. 1.) The  fruit, like that of the Thomasvil1e, acquires something of an orange flavor  as it ripens. It seems to be an early ripening variety. The peel is mild  flavored, and the seeds are few.  Stil1 another citrangequat is C. P. B. No. 48050, a hybrid of the oval  kumquat with the Rusk citrange. It attracted the attention of Mr. J.  W. Benson, a cooperator living at Sinton, San Patricio County, Tex.,  near Corpus Christi, by its superior cold resistance and nearly seedless  fruits. A tree that flowered in October, 1918, carried a crop through  the winter unharmed. Samples received at Washington on April 23,  1919, were very like a lime in appearance and flavor, but showed a smal1,  fleshy calyx, somewhat like that of the Rusk citrange parent. Fruits  of this number, received November I, 1920, from Glen St. Mary, Fla.,  were strikingly handsome, being bright orange or even flame scarlet in  color. They were from I~ to lYE inches in diameter, nearly spherical,  and had few or no seeds. These fruits were overripe, but the pulp was  still acid, so this is doubtless an early maturing variety suitable only  for ade.  As this citrangequat has attracted attention, not only because of its  nearly seedless lime- like fruits produced in Texas, but also because of  the extraordinarily brilliant color of the fully ripe fruits in Florida, it  seems best to give it a name. It is accordingly called the Sinton X  citrangequat. 1o -  EUSTIS LIMEQUAT  In 1909, the senior author originated a new type of citrous fruits by  crossing theWest Indian lime with the kumquat oranges. Those familiar  with citrous fruits know that the lime is the tenderest of all the commonly  grown species of this group. It frequently freezes to the ground even  in southern Florida, so that its culture is chiefly confined to the fringe  of keys along the coast. The kumquat, on the other hand, is one of the  hardiest of the evergreen citrous fruit trees. This is without doubt not  so much due to its direct powers of cold resistance as to its remarkable  dormancy. The kumquat, as noted above, is able to pass unaffected  through long spells of hot weather that force other Citrus trees into a  tender and succulent growth that is liable to be injured by even a light  9 ' l'ECHNICAL DJ!

II, 9); rind very thin, smooth, highly colored, 1'&lt; inch in thickness and much like kumquat, show­ing  almost none of the flavor of the trifoliate orange; oil cells few, variable in number; segments 7 to 8; no  seed in 100 of fruits, occasionally one or a few; pulp pale, varying from orange- buff ( RIDGWAY, Robert, OP.

Journal of Agricultural Research Vol. XXIII, No. ~  frost. Some measure of the dormancy of the kumquats is indicated by  the fact that they flower from two to three months later than other  citrous trees.  This series of crosses between the lime and the kumquats was made at  Eustis, Fla., in June, 1909, in the Citrus grove of Mr. F. W. Savage. These  crosses resulted in a number of hybrids varying in character, but all  having fruits much like the lime in quality. Attention has been attracted  to one of these hybrids ( C. P. B. No. 48798) that fruited during the  summer of 1918 in the greenhouse of the Department of Agriculture  at ' Washington, D. C. It resulted from fertilizing the flowers of the  common or West Indian lime with pollen of the round kumquat.  The Eustis limequat fruit is of striking appearance, strongly resem­bling  a West India lime in color, size, and texture. ( PI. 4.) The color is  a light yellow, resembling the color of grapefruit. When cut, the fruit  shows its lime- like character. It is very juicy, thin- skinned, has few  seeds, and the flavor can hardly be distinguished even by an expert from  the true lime. Moreover, the rind is edible, like that of the kumquat,  so that the whole fruit may be utilized. It is particularly promising  as a fruit for crystallizing. The spines on the bearing wood are  very inconspicuous, a decided point in favor of this hybrid in contrast  with the viciously spiny character of the common lime. Some of the  other limequats exhibit rather long spines, even on the small twigs.  Observations coveringseveral seasons indicate that this limequat possesses  much of the immunity to disease and insect pests enjoyed by the kum­quat.  The kumquat is the most resistant to Citrus- canker of all citrous  varieties, a resistance amounting to practical immunity, an advantage  the limequat has in some degree.  Specimens submitted to Citrus experts and growers have in every case  elicited favorable opinions, it being held that the limequat's place in  citrous fruit culture is not dependent entirely upon unusual hardiness.  Even should it prove no more hardy than the sweet orange, it would still  be of great value throughout the orange- growing regions, as the lime is  so extremely tender that its culture is now almost entirely confined to  the protected keys along the Florida coast. This hybrid, as well as  several sister hybrids of this limequat, have been fruited at Glen St.  Mary, Fla., in the northern tier of Florida counties, but were killed in  the successive freezes of 1917 and 1918. \ Vith a little protection while  young, and during unusually severe weather, it is probable that this  hardy form of lime could be grown in the warmer parts of the Gulf Coast,  supplying a real need in this region.  In Florida, California lemons are not obtainable owing to the quaran­tine  restrictions necessary to prevent the introduction of " brown rot."  Sicilian lemons are often expensive and are only obtainable in the larger  to'wns, so that it often happens that a good acid citrous fruit for ade  making is a decided scarcity even in Citrus- growing territory.  Budding experiments on different stocks are in progress and the  present indications are that the limequat will thrive on most of  the stocks commonly used except sour orange. Unlike the Thomasville  citrangequat the Eustis limequat does not come true from seed. Nursery  propagation is chiefly confined to the rough lemon and trifoliate orange  stocks. Like the lime, if planted low and mounded with soil the limequat  bud will strike root, thus simplifying the stock question. Its fruiting sea­SOl1  is also of importance. To be of the greatest service in the home fruit  garden it should bear the bulk of its crop in the warm summer months.  Jan, 27, 1923 Citrangequats and Limequats 237  The indications are from " the few trees that are in bearing in Florida  that it will prove more or less everbearing, following the lime parent in  this regard. No doubt its fruiting season can be influenced by methods  of fertilization and pruning. Selection of budwood from early or  summer- bearing trees will also be desirable.  The limequat promises to become a valuable addition to our list of  citrous fruits. Since the original cross pollination resulting in this new  fruit was made at Eustis, Fla., a well- known Citrus- producing center,  it is proposed to name this hybrid the " Eustis limequat."  TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF EUSTIS LIMEQUAT  Fmit oval ( occasionally nearly spherical) slightly asymmetrical, mature fruits  having a long diameter averaging Irs to I] i inches, diameter in cross section, 178 to  IV, inches; calyx persistent; color light yellow (" picric yellow")"; rind thin, -. h  inch, very smooth and glossy, translucent; oil cells spherical, rather prominent,  having no bitter flavor; segments 6 to 9; seeds 5 to 12, usually averaging I to the segment,  small to medium size, .7: i to } i inch in length; pulp of light greenish color, closely  resembling lime, tender and juicy, flavor sharply acid ( like the lime the fmit can be  used when full sized but not fully colored); tree evergreen, vigorous, having a tendency  to produce long shoots which bend downward with the weight of the fruit; resembles  the lime in producing a succession of crops, though not so markedly everbearing;  spines on bearin~ twigs very small, not injuring the fruit; flowers s- petaled, pure white  ( not streaked WIth pink as those of the lime and of most other limequats); leaves  unifoliate, rather thick, dark green above, lighter below, tapering at both base and  apex, 2 to 3 inches long, slightly folded along the midrib, having short, narrow petioles,  closely resembling leaves of the round kumquat except for larger size.  OTHER LIMEQUATS  In addition to the Eustis limequat, some 28 other hybrids were made  by the senior author in 1909 between the West India lime and the  kumquat.- Twenty- four of these, like the Eustis, are hybrids of the  West India lime and the round kumquat; f0ur are hybrids of the West  India lime and the oval kumquat. Only about one- third of these have  been studied in detail, but several of them are being grown in Florida  and other Southern States. Perhaps the most promising of these is a  limequat ( C. P. B. 48786) of the same parentage as the Eustis; that is  another cross between the same two parent trees. This is the largest  limequat yet produced, sometimes equaling a smallle'mon in size, usually  being about IU inches in diameter and 2;{ inches long. The fruits,  bright yellow when ripe, have a very pale pulp of a pleasant acid flavor,  similar to the Mexican lime, the' skin is very thin but tough and of a  mild flavor. There are from two to nine seeds in a fruit.  This limequat has done particularly well in the garden of Hon. H. J.  Drane at Lakeland, Fla., and as it is likely to be propagated more or  less it seems desirable to give it a name. It is accordingly called the  Lakeland limequat ( PI. S, A).' 2  Another limequat that has attracted much favorable notice is C. P. B.  No. 48792. This is a hybrid of the Mexican lime with the oval kumquat,  11 RIDGWAY, Robert, GP. CIT., pI. IV, d 23.  111 TeCHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF LAKELAND LIM£ QUA1': Fruits very smooth, attractive in appearance,  oval, average 2y' inches long Itt inches in diameter; Calyx not persistent; color Strojfian yellow ( RWGWAY;  Robert, GP. CIT., pI. XVI, 23); rind very thin, smooth, sweet and edible like that of kumquat; oil cells  large and prominent. transparent, showing through the rind, seiments 5 to 8, seeds 2 to 9, large and oval,  usually about 6; pulp pale, massicot yellow ( RIDGWAY, Robert, GP. CIT" pI. XVI, f, 21). resembling  lime; very juicy, sh~ rply acid, that of linIe; good before fruit is fully colored; leaves 2)/ 0 to 3 inches in length;  evergreen, unifoIiate. lanceolate acuminate, petiole short, very narrowiy winged; tree vigorous, bearing  wood nearly spineless.  Journal of Agricultural Research Vol. XXIII, No. ¢  whereas the Eustis limequat and the Lakeland limequat are hybrids of  the Mexican lime with the round kumquat, As this limequat has already  been propagated to some extent in Florida and is certain to become more  or less widespread as a dooryard fruit, it seems best to give it a name.  It is accordingly called the Tavares limequat, 13 ' Tavares being the town  adjoining Eustis, between which two cities lies Mr. Frank W. Savage's  orange grove, where this and all the other limequats were produced.  The fruits are very similar to those of the Eustis limequat in appear­ance,  and have much the same flavor. ( PI. 5, B.) It is often difficult to  distinguish the fruits of these two varieties, the Tavares and the Eustis.  On the whole the Eustis seems to be rather better in quality than the  Tavares. The two can easily be distinguished by the fact that the  flower buds of the Eustis are pure white while those of the Tavares.  have a pinkish coloration, like those of the West Indian lime.  13 TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF TAVARES LlME: QUAT: Fruits obovate or oval, occasionally nearly  spherical; . r.( to Iof. inches long, I~ to Ii. inches in diameter; light cadmium yellow ( RIDGWAY, Robert,  OP.

WITH ESPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE NATURAL SCIENCES ·  By WALTER T. SWINGLE AND MAUDE KELLERMAN SWINGLlI:,  Bureau 01 Plant Industry, Department 01 Agriculture, Washington, D. O.  Photographic methods are no novelty in  library research wcrk and many rare  manuscripts and incunabula have been re­produced  photographically. It is our pur­pose  to call attention to the possibility of  making fuller and more frequent use of  some of the newer photographic methods  in library research work, particularly in  the natural sciences and industrial work.  Photostat Used to Copy Books and  Manuscripts  In recent years there have been placed  on the market large cameras which take  photographs by the light of a mercury  vapor lamp directly on a roll of sensitized  paper which after exposure is cut off and de­veloped  at once in the machine. These ca­meras  are known by the trade names of  photostat, cameragraph, etc., and were orig ·  inally devised for use in copying important  legal documents, letters, drawings, plans,  etc. Such a camera has proved so valuable  in our work that we venture to give a few  notes on the uses to which we have found  it fitted.  We have used in our work the larger  size photostat ( No. 2), which is able to  take a roll of paper 13 inches wide and  can also use the narrower roll, 11 inches  wide. It takes a photograph of a maximum  length of 17lh inches. By using the wide  paper a print 17lhx13 inches can be secured;  allowing for trimming, plates or printed  pages up to 16lhx12 can be taken natural  size. The large size machine can be set to  wind off automatically 9 or 18 inches of  paper and the smaller one 7: 1h or 16 inches.  By a new attachment devised by the junior  author it is possible to wind into place  36 different lengths of paper, varying from  one- half to 18 inches, so it is easy to set  the machine to make the most economical  use of the sensitized paper in photograph ·  ing' a book, plate or · map. A special frame  that comes with the machine permits the  book to be held in a horizontal position  and the image is rectified by passing  through a right- angled prism which cor­rects  the reversal of the image due to the  photographic lens. Consequently a direct  exposure gives a negative as to color, 1. e.  white letters on black background, but a  positive as to position, 1. e. the print can  be read directly from the face of" the paper.  This permits the use of such a direct  image or negative for reproducing printed  or written matter.  The commercial uses of the photostat  are usually limited to negative prints, 1. e.  letters, specifications, diagrams, drawings,  etc., are reproduced in white on a black  ground. Such negative prints are very  useful for reproducing a single page or a  few pages of a publication and may some­times  be used in photographing botanical  specimens. If several copies are required,'  all that needs to be done is to make several  exposures without changing the position of  the book or specimen.  One drawback to such copies is that the  black background prevents notes or correc ��  tions being added with pencil or pen. Even  red ink coos not show up well on the black  ground. ( Chinese vermilion ink that is  ground on a slab like india ink makes a  very good mark, and liquid white mk may  be used.)  By photographing the nega; ive print  again a positive is secured which has black  • Paper read at the College and Reterence Section ot the American Library Association,  Asbury Park Conference. Reprinted trom Bulletin of the American Library Association,  July. 1916.  letters on a white ground. Such a copy  can be annotated as easily as the original,  which it is often desirable to preserve in­tact.  By using positive prints pasted back  to bacle it is possible to make very good  copies of printed works that look , remark­ably  like the original work. In all cases  where positives are made a negative copy  is also available. These negatives can be  bound up by perforating them so they can  be tied into a pamphlet holder or a special  binder made to fit them. They are then  available at any time for making additional  positive copies. It is sometimes desirable  to make the negatives natural size,  whereas the positive can sometimes be re­duced  in size to advantage, making a more  convenient volume.  It frequently happens in copying old,  more or less discolored, books or manu­scripts  that it is necessary to use a color  screen and make long exposures to secure  good negatives. Such negatives when once  secured can, however, be copied into posi­tive  prints very rapidly. Moreover, the  copying of negatives is always easier than  making prints from the original book,  since it is not necessary to open the frame  and adjust the pages as with the book.  In general it would seem desirable to  preserve the original negatives in the  library and to make positive prints for the  use of investigators. If, in addition to the  cost of making the positive copy, say one­tenth  of the cost of making the original  negatives is charged to the investigator, in  the long run the libraries will get back the  initial expense of making negatives and  at the same time supply to students positive  copies more cheaply than negatives can be  furnished. Such positives have the ad ·  vantage of reproducing properly any illus­tration  that may accompany the text. Only  simple line drawings or mechanical dia­grams  appear equally well on the negative  and positive copies. All complicated illus­trations  and especially all photographic  process illustrations are difficult to under­stand  or use in the negative copy. Further­more,  notes can easily be made on the  white surface, whereas negative prints can  2  only be annotated by using white ink or  Chinese vermilion.  In copying works printed in non­European  alphabets not to be found in the  ordinary printing office and not capable of  being typewritten, the photostat is, of  course, invaluable. It has been found to be  particularly useful in handling Chinese  works on agriculture and botany. On ac­count  of the scarcity of translators it is  often necessary to send such material to  China or Japan to have it translated or  abstracted. The photostat makes it easy  to do such work cheaply. In the copying of  ancient manuscripts the photostat method  is absolutely necessary to secure accuracy.  By using this machine, such copies can be  made at very reasonable cost.  Having formerly used glass plates for  reproducing rare books, we are in position  to know from experience not only the  heavy cost of such a method but also the  great difficulties in filing in a safe and  convenient manner the heavy and easily  breakable negatives.  Photostat negatives are merely sheets  of flat paper and if properly bound may  be used for reference if the original work  or the positive copy is not at hand.  We have found that in order to keep  the operating cost of the photostat low  per unit of work it is necessary to keep  the machine in continuous use during at  least five or six working hours each day,  thereby permitting an economic utilization  of the operator's time and of the chemicals  used for developing. In this way we have  found that the total cost may be kept down  as low as 4% cents per photostat print  7% xll inches.  Although it is a fact that even a beginner  can get some sort of results with the photo­stat,  it is nevertheless true that a con­siderable  degree of skill is necessary to  enable an operator to get the best results,  especially in copying old or discolored  books or manuscripts and in making first­class  positive copies. It is well worth while  for librarians having such work done to  insist upon a h. igh standard of excellence  in photostat copies. In this way, without  materially increasing the cost, a superior  grade of work can be obtained.  Utilization of Photography In Botanical  Researches  Besides these obvious uses in reproduc­ing  rare or costly manuscripts or printed  books and articles, we have found the  photostat very useful in other ways.  In our work on crop plants and par­ticularly  in the study of the citrus fruits  and their wild relatives, we have found  it necessary to have at hand the original  descriptions of hundreds of different  species and also notes as to their uses in  their native countries, etc. These descrip­tions  and notes are, of course, scattered  through many hundreds of volumes and  even though one might happen to be so  extraordinarily fortunate as to have within  reach a library containing all of the books  needed, it is not a simple matter to have  a dozen or more descriptions from as  many different books immediately before  one for comparison.  Our citrus index comprises descriptions  of more than twenty genera, each one of  which has a number of species; in addition  there are copies of numerous illustrations.  Yet all of this material is contained in one­filing  drawer and is immediately acce~ sible  for consultation and comparison.  In addition to this file we have made up  booklets in cases where accounts and dis­cussions  of several species are included  in one work. The title page of the book  is included in these booklets and an index  of the species to be found in the  photostat copy is bound in at the front of  the booklet. In this way we have a small  citrus library of our own containing the  material on this special subject which is  scattered through hundreds of volumes,  many of them so bulky or so rare that they  are practically inaccessible for daily use.  We have found it possible to use to ad­vantage  the large size machine in making  copies of valuable herbarium specimens  which we cannot retain in our own collec­tion.  These prints are made on glossy  finish paper which gives a print somewhat  3  like that from a glass plate. In many  cases the type specimens of plants are too  precious to be consulted except for very  critical work. For all ordinary purposes  the photostat print suffices.  Instances of the Use of Photography In  Library Research Work  One of the most important uses of the  method outlined above is to supply missing  numbers of periodicals or missing pages  from valuable books. It has been possible  for us to complete in this way a number of  very important old works on natural his­tory  and in one case a series of 61 dis­sertations  of the University of Upsala,  Sweden, published from 1787 to 1827, con­stituting  a catalogue of the Natural His­tory  Museum of Upsala, a collection of un­usual  importance because it contained  many specimens collected by Linnaeus or  his pupils upon which the scientific names  now current all over the world were based.  No American library had a complete set but  by using the photostat two. complete sets  were made up, one for the Library of Con­gress  ( 51 original, 10 photostat copies) and  one for the New York Botanical Garden ( 59  original, 2 photostat copies). A memo­randum  bound in the Library of Congress  copy shows where each original was found  ( they came from four public libraries and  one private collection) so that in case of  special investigations involving the quality  of paper or ink, the original could be found  and consulted.  A more extensive piece of work is the  making of a photostat copy of an entire  book, as was done with Osbeck's pagbok  ofwer en Ostindisk Resa, Stockholm, 1757.  Only on~ copy of this work could then be  located in this country. Since it was very  important for our work we borrowed this  copy and made one negative and two posi­tive  copies of it. The original negatives  are filed in our office, one positive copy is  filed in the library of the Department of  Agriculture and the other positive copy  is now available for field use s~ hat an ex­plorer  traveling in China may consult the  descriptions of plants that were written  more than one hundred and fifty years ago  by Osbeck, a pupil of Linnaeus, who was  the first botanist to assign modern scien­tific  names to Chinese plants.  Another instance showing the im\ lortance  of photographic methods in reproducing an  entire book is that of the original account  of a new and virulent disease of sugar cane  and maize that appeared six years ago in  Formosa. A bulletin issued by the Sugar  Experiment Station of the Formosan  Government in December, 1911, consisting  of some 80 pages and 9 plates gave a full  description of the new parasitic fungus  causing the disease. It was not found in  any library in Washington and was finally  borrowed from the library of the Sugar  Planters' Experiment Station at Honolulu,  Hawaii. The entire bulletin and plates  were copied by the photostat and largely  because of the information thus secured it  has been possible for the Federal Horti­cultural  Board of the Department of Agri­culture  to put into effect quarantine regula­tions  which it is believed will effectively  prevent the introduction into this country  of this dangerous maize parasite which if  once introduced might easily cause a hun­dred  million dollars a year damage to the  corn crop of the United States. As the  bulletin in question contained maps, photo­gravures,  lithographic plates, and was,  moreover, written in Japanese, it would  have been impracticable to copy it at any  reasonable cost in any other way than by  photography.  Every Book and Manuscript In the World  Placed Within the Reach of the Investi­gator  by Photographic Means  It often happens that important investi­gations  on critical matters involving inter­ests  into the tens or even hundreds of  millions are delayed for years because of  the lack of books which are known to exist  in Old World libraries. Often these books  are rarely or never put on the market,  practically all of the copies being in the  pOllsession of museums, libraries and other  public institutions. Under such circum­stances  it seems the part of wisdom to  4  make definite arrangements by which pho­tographic  copies can be secured promptly  of all works believed to be of importance  for scientific or economic investigations in  progress in this country. It is believed  that any objection the librarians might  feel to having photographic copies made  of their treasures would be removed by de­livering  to the library furnishing the work  to be copied a complete photostat copy of  it. This could be circulated to readers in  place of the originai copy which could be  kept under lock and key and only consulted  on critical matters. In this way the use of  the photostat would not only result in the  wider diffusion and greater use of rare  books but also in the better preservation  of the originals from which the photo­graphic  copies were made.  In view of the difficulty, often impossf.  b1l1ty, of purchasing old foreign books it  becomes evident that in the photostat we  have a cheap and efficient means of repro­ducing  quickly such works as are needed  by American investigators. It will be  necessary to place a photostat in one or  more favorably situated cities in Europe  and then copy such books and papers as  they are needed:  We often forget that European investiga­tors  have access not only to the books of  their own libraries but to those of foreign  countries either by exchange or by a few  hours railway travel. The English and  French investigators for example, have ac­cess  to the national libraries of France,  Belgium, Holland and England and by a  railway journey not exceeding ' eight to  twelve hours' duration. In order to  give our investigators facilities equal  to those of western Europe our great  libraries should be very much more  complete than those of London, Paris  and Berlin, not, as is actually the case,  much less complete. The only feasible way  to supplement our scanty library facilities  is to use modern scientific and business  methods to make available the books of the  Old World until we are able and willing  to purchase copies. In the case of manu­scripts  of which often only a single copy  I  n- Ot  D  A t-------+-------- IB  in the middle with the two blank sides  pasted together; the pages will then follow  in the same order as in the original book.  ( b) A positive copy made from such  negative.  4. A book ( Osbeck, Dagbok Ofwer en  Ostindisk Resa, Stockholm, 1757) in posi ��  tive photostat copy, one- fourth natural size,  made as described below:  If the negatives show large clear print,  four negatives, each of two pages, can be  placed at once in the frame under the lens  and a reduced positive copy made on a  single sheet. For example, pages 8- 15 of  a book would be arranged thus:  14- 15 3- 9  exists it is obvioul that the photostat will  be invaluable for making cheap copies.  There is no longer any need for any  competent scholar to be hampered for lack  ot material provided arrangements are  made to install photostats in Old World  library centers.  Finally the need of the isolated worker  in our own country can be met by furnish­ing  him with photographic copies of the  literature he cannot consult in his ltate.  Possibly if the original user were charged  a fifth or a tenth of the cost of such a  copy enough other copies could be sold  to make the work self- supporting in a short  time.  If American scholars are to take the  place in the learned and scientific world to  which their energy, originality and in­telligence  entitle them steps must be  taken to free them from the heavy handi­cap  they now suffer in competition with  their Old- World colleagues because of the  greater volume of old books and records  at the disposal of the European scholars.  il  APPENDIX: NOTES ON THE SPECI-MENS  OF PHOTOSTAT WORK  EXHIBITED  1. ( a) Negative photostat copies on  loose sheets, such as are used in com­mercial  work.  ( b) Positives made from such negatives.  2. ( a) Negative prints in loose- leaf  binders. In the case of material of which  it may at any time be desirable to make ex­tra  copies, the negatives are made natural  size, perforated at the margin, and pre­served  in these binders so as to be avail­able  for making positive copies.  ( b) Positives made from these nega­tives.  3. ( a) Negative prints trimmed and  rearranged for use in reproducing books.  In the case of books that open flat it is  often cheaper and quicker to make a print  of two pages at one exposure. These can  then be cut apart and tipped on large  sheets of black paper in reverse order.  When the positive is made it can be folded  The resulting positive is folded first on  the line A- B and the blank sides pasted  together. Then the pasted sheet is folded  on the line C- D; turning the double page  14- 15 under, leaving the double page 8- 9  on top. If the book is bound with guards,  such a folded sheet, carrying 8 pages of  the original work, can be attached to the  stub by a single strip of linen which  greatly reduces the work of binding.  5. ( a) Negative prints stapled or  sewed into a booklet without being pasted.  These are useful for reference work and  notes can be made on the blank side of the  print.  ( b) Positive prints made up into a  booklet in the same way.  6. ( a) Negative prints with the blank  sides pasted together bound into a booklet.  These small booklets resemble the original  book from which they are made except  that black and white are . eversed. Posi­tives  pasted and bound in the same way  make notations in the text easier. If bound  with each sheet guarded these books open  5  flat and are often easier to use than the  original.  7. ( a) Negative prints of herbarium  specimens, on glossy paper, 16¥. ixll%  inches. Prints of this kind, made natural  size, are very useful when the original  specimen is not available for study.  They can be made for a small fraction of  the cost of bromide enlargements from  glass negatives.  8. Photostat cards and booklets from  the Citrus index. A sample showing  method of handling and indexing litera­ture  relating to the cultivated species of  Citrus and their wild relatives. This in­dex  comprises loose sheets, filed alpha­betically,  giving the original descriptions  of about twenty genera of the orange sub ·  family of plants, having from one to fifty  or more species; in addition there are  photostat copies of numerous illustrations.  Besides these loose sheets there are about  two hundred booklets made up from indio  vidual books, monographs, and local floras,  6  which contain accounts and discussions of  several species.  9. Photostat copy of index of Chinese  botany. The Chill, wu ming shih t'u k'ao  by Wu Ch'i chiin, the best modern work  on Chinese botany, comprises 60 volumes  but has no index and no general table of  contents, though one is given at the begin­ning  of each volumt. These tables of con­tents  of the individual volumes were copied  with the photostat, the page references  added and the whole bound together,  which greatly facilitates looking up any  particular plant in the text. This piece of  worlr could scarcely have been done at  all without using the photostat.  10. Card index of Chinese plant names.  Extra copies of the tables of contents of  the Chinese botany noted above were made  and the plant names occurring in the work  pasted on cards, obviating the difficulty and  expense of writing these Chinese char­acters. 	asm0188000011	Text						application/pdf										2009-05-19	2010-02-22	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/wtswingle/id/111	111	110.pdf	/wtswingle/image/110.pdf

page 1																										&gt;. 2  1  y  ~  1-  ~  e  WALTER TENNYSON SWINGLE: BOTANIST  AND EXPONENT OF CHINESE CIVILIZATION  Harley Harris Bartlett  n WALTER TENNYSON SWINGLE, who died at Washington on January 19,  w 1952, was one of the last survivors of the group of young botanists who  ~- founded our Gray Memorial Botanical Association in 1887 and initiated  Ig its activities in 1888. Dr. Cornelius L. Shear may now be the last of  the founding members, but there has not yet been time since the re­organization  of the Association to trace to their conclusion the careers  of several whose names appear on the early roll.  In the historical sketch which appeared in our first number it was  stated that " an adequate hIstory of such an organization as the Gray  Botanical Memorial Association would have to be largely biographical,  dealing with the botanists who belonged to it, and were helped by it to  become effective amateurs or professional botanists." Brief biogra­phies  of early members were promised, as supplements to the brief  historical sketch, and, even before the promise was published, news of  SWingle's death was received. He was one of the most distinguished of  the founding members, and, indeed, one of the outstanding American  ? otanists of his time, notable not only for his many accomplishments  in botany, but likewise as a student of Chinese contributions to science,  technology, and civilization.  Childhood and Early Youth at Manhattan  C Walter Tennyson Swingle was born January 8, 1871, on a farm in  F~ naan Tow~ ship, Wayne County, Pennsylvania, the son of John  E etcher SWIngle and Mary Astley Swingle. His mother was born in  h ngland. When Walter was two years old the family moved to Man­vattan,  Kansas, where they bought a hill farm. This proved to have  Per~ POor Soil, so it was eventually sold and another one, on good  cr at lrie land ' was purchased. As the boy grew up he helpe d hI. S f a th er  h~ Wood and attended to other farm chores such as driving the cows  te;:. from pasture. He loved the plants he saw, and, if no one could  stutt 1m what they were, he made up names of his own for them. He  diU. ered badly as a boy, and had a hard struggle to overcome this  gre~~~ lty of s~ eech. Obviously, however, it did not handicap him too  he h J' for hIS extraordinary proficiency in systematic botany, before  of a a. had much, if any, formal education, set him apart as somewhat  n Inte llectual prodigy.

Not too  much is available at the moment about Swingle's boyhood, although  there may be sources that will eventually become available. We have  his own word for it that his early schooling was irregular, and that  for the most part he was taught at home. That, however, he looked  upon as an advantage, for in later years he held, with his friend O. F.  Cook, that regular schooling might result in too much regimentation  and standardization, and that children would develop faster and with  greater individuality if allowed to follow their natural bents.  It was fortunate indeed that Manhattan was the seat of the Kansas  Agricultural College and Experiment Station, for in the person of pro­fessor  William Ashbrook Kellerman young Swingle at the age of seven­teen  found someone who could broaden his natural interests in system­atic  botany. How he had developed scientific competence so early maY  not be a matter of record, but it is a fact that it was also when he was  17, and two years before he graduated from college, that he was giVen  the title of Assistant Botanist in the Experiment Station.  t  I  t  F.  o  t 																		2009-05-20	2009-05-20	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/wtswingle/id/128	128	129.pdfpage	/wtswingle/image/129.pdfpage
page 3																										· 2 Apr. 1952 ASA GRAY BULLETIN 109  It was only natural that Swingle, after falling under Kellerman's in­fluence  , should have turned to mycology and plant pathology, the sub­jects  which then chiefly interested Kellerman. Of this Fairchild writes:  " I first met Walter T. Swingle in the laboratory of Dr. W. A. Kellerman  ... Dr. Kellerman was a pioneer in the study of plant diseases, and  Swingle entered that new field with the enthusiasm that was to charac­terize  him through his 81 years of life. He showed me some black  powder, the spores of a fungus that sometimes transformed the heads  of wheat and ruined the crop -- the so- called ' bunt' of wheat. Swingle's  discovery that this could be stopped by plunging the grain used for  seed into hot water before planting became one of the standard farm  practices. He was only 16 when he read a paper on the rust of cereals  before the College Scientific Society."  Swingle received the degree of B. S. at Manhattan in 1890, and left  for his life- long career in the U. S. Department of Agriculture in 1891.  The bibliographic record of this youth's accomplishment from 1888 to  1891 is remarkable, for although most of the articles that appeared  during this period were in joint authorship with Kellerman, there were  at least twenty- seven of them, varying from brief notes to papers of  considerable length, and he was sole author of six. He must have been  one of those charter members of the Gray Memorial Botanical Chap­ter  who had no trouble about turning in reports of botanical activity  quarterly or whenever they were duel Members of the Gray Memo­rial  Association are likely to see significance in the fact that Swingle  was one of its charter members in 1888, the year of his first publica­tion,  and that this organization ( it was founded as the Gray Memorial  Chapter of the Agassiz Association, in December, 1887) had just com­menced  its activities with the requirement of a quarterly report of  botanical activity from each member.  These early publications fall into. two groups, and each group initi­ated  a phase of Swingle's career which was of long duration or contin­uous  throughout his life.  It would now be interesting to know what he wrote about in his early  Unpublished reports to the Gray Memorial Botanical Chapter, appar­ently  no longer in existence, but that there were any that could be  ~. lassified as juvenilia is to be doubted, since he was writing for pub­lcation  at the same time, and was already under Kellerman's guid-  ~ c~: SWingle's publications, of sole or joint authorship, appeared in  E e J? urnal of Mycology" , the " Reports of the Kansas Agricultural  thX{ lenment Station", and " The Industrialist", a serial publication of  e Kansas State Agricultural College.  ij' ~ ost of the early papers were on mycology and plant pathology.  o lS lnterest in this general field continued, as was shown by the vig­/  ous measures which he advocated during his later life for eradica-lOn  Or Control of citrus canker and the dreaded South American 																		2009-05-20	2009-05-20	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/wtswingle/id/129	129	130.pdfpage	/wtswingle/image/130.pdfpage

Swingle's last paper on pathology  that had a background of his early observations and research in Kansas  seems to have been a Farmers' Bulletin of the U. S. Department of  Agriculture on the prevention of smut in wheat and oats, issued in 1906.  Some years later, however, he undertook the writing of definitions of  mycological and plant physiological terms for Funk and Wagnall's  " Standard Dictionary of the English Language" ( Editions of 1913 to  1931), in which task he was aided by his eminent colleague in the Bu­reau  of Plant Industry, Erwin F. Smith.  A second group of his early contributions record the beginning of  his life- long activity as a plant breeder and student of genetical phe­nomena,  for there are six contributions on maize hybridization and th~  characteristics of the hybrids through the third hybrid generation.  After he went to Washington his work on corn was discontinued, for the  project remained at Manhattan as part of the continuing program of the  Kansas Agricultural Experiment Station. Swingle's subsequent work  on plant hybrids was to be mostly with Citrus and allied genera.  It was during the Manhattan period that Swingle determined to learn  to read technical German with facility. This had not come about throu~  the taking of formal courses, so he turned for help to a German immi­grant  laborer whose job was to feed the pigs! This man's aid and his  own diligent study enabled him to read German easily and prepared him  for later study at the German universities of Bonn and Leipzig.  He formed student friendships at Manhattan that lasted throughout  life. It was there that he first knew David Fairchild and Frank  Thackery. He remained an associate of Fairchild's in the Department  of Agriculture, and when he was abroad on numerous missions of plant  introduction and exploration, his most indefatigable and voluminous  correspondent was always Fairchild. Mrs. Swingle writes that " Frank  Thackery was in a later class and went into the Indian Service. Their  paths converged when Mr. Swingle had cooperative work with the Indian  SerVice, and later Thackery became his assistant in the date work.  Their personal friendship also led to prospecting for copper mines,  though without financial results."  Swingle's connection with the U. S. Department of Agriculture began  in 1891, before he was of age, and he was unable to accept appOintment  without parental permission. He was only twenty. Fairchild writes:  ' 1n 1889 I joined the little section of Vegetable Pathology of the just  recently established Department of Agriculture, and in 1891 Swingle  became the seventh of that tiny group of research men - all of uS  scarcely more than boys. Intense interest was developing in Bordea~  mixture, which had rather recently been discovered in France, and  American orchardists were clamoring for plant pathologists to help  them fight their tree diseases.

I still have a postal card from  him saying that orange trees looked something like oaks, but had  orange- colored fruits hanging from their branches. And so began  Swingle's life- long, deep interest in citrus. New interests were taken  on with such avidity that his bibliography became increasingly varied.  With Dr. H. J. Webber, his early collaborator in the production of cit­rus  hybrids, he was greatly interested in establishing a Subtropical  Laboratory. Jointly and individually they wrote about its objectives in  1892 and 1893. Experience in Florida led to publication of observations  on Florida Fungi, of a new Florida palm, of experiments on control of  White Fly and Red Scale, of the diseases of citrus fruits, of improved  methods of making Bordeaux mixture. As to Swingle's dominating ab­sorption  with the botany of Citrus, I must again quote i'airchild, who  says: " He undertook almost at once the breeding in north Florida of  all the kinds of citrus then ! mown there; a work with which the names  of Ralph Robinson and Frank Savage and his son Maurice will always  be associated. I have on my desk before me here the Minneola tangelo  -- grown extensively now -- evidence of his first entry into a Florida  citrus grove."  Study in Germany: Travel Abroad  The first four busy years in the Department of Agriculture were  largely taken up with joint work in Florida with H. 1. Webber. Then  in 1895 Swingle went to Germany, to study at Bonn. The outcome was  a contribution in German on the cytology of the Sphacelariaceae, pub­lished  in 1897. Again, in 1898, he studied at Leipzig.  At home and abroad, the publications from 1896 to 1916 give evi­dence  of work on the diseases, life history, agronomy, introduction, or  i~ provement by breeding of pineapples, guava, coffee, burr artichoke.  hg, date. pistachio, and cotton, but also show a growing intensification  of interest in Citrus and allies. After 1916 the initiation of new work  ~ ith plants generally had some connection with citrus, but his histor­lcal  delving in Chinese literature was well under way.  Work On the " caprification" of the fig began to be published in 1899  ~ nd extended at least down to 1910. It was Swingle who introduced the  lnsect which pollinates the fig and thereby insured the success of fig  ~~ lture in the United States. He never lost an opportunity to add some  It to his knowledge of " fruit" production in the fig.  Introduction of Date Palms  SWingle's name, in the minds of many, stands chiefly for the mem­~  rable achievement of introducing date culture into the Southwest.

Vol. I, No. 2  of Agriculture was young, but the prestige that came to him for suc­cess  was of necessity somewhat deferred, for date palms do not quickly  come to maturity. By the time his palms were in bearing, and a new  industry had been established with which his name will always be as­sociated,  Swingle had shifted his main botanical interest to Citrus and  its allies, and his chief geographical field from the Mediterranean re­gion  to the Far East. Nevertheless his many publications on date cul­ture  ran clear through from 1901 to 1947, and his most elaborate pub­lication,  aside from his treatise on the Citrus allies, is his famous  Bureau of Plant Industry Bulletin No. 53, of 1904, on " The Date Palm  and its Utilization in the Southwestern States."  He well realized when he plunged into the job of introducing date  cultivation into America that there would not be any quick or certain  results. Fairchild sent him on his quest to North Africa, and recol­lected  the circumstances years later. '' I remember as well as if it  were yesterday what Swingle said when he heard that he had been cho­sen  to bring in the date", Dr. Fairchild said: "' My land!', he exclaimed  ' we'll be old men before we can get a date industry established. If' But  Swingle lived to see the industry a successful one , and even to own and  operate his own experimental date garden at Indio, California. So long  as Swingle was in Washington nobody could ever rightly accuse the  Bureau of Plant Industry of having a dearth of ideas! The man effer­vesced  with them.  Sometimes they stirred up rather violent controversies. The great­est  excitement was about his theory of metaxenia, the term which he  devised for the modification of parental tissue of date fruits by the de­velopment  of a hybrid seed within the fruit. His opponents held that  his observations had been wrong; that any supposed effect on the tissues  of a pistillate parent, because of having been pollinated by another spe­Cies,  and bearing hybrid embryo and endosperm, was all imaginary  bosh and nonsense. Swingle was confident of the accuracy of his obser­vations.  What irritated him especially was the apparent assumption by  some of his critics that he was scientifically a moss- back, who might  possibly not understand elementary genetics, and whose conclusions  need not be seriously received. Hormone effect was eventually pro­posed  by Swingle as the explanation of his observations, but plant hor­mones  were not yet being talked about and the old ideas of " formative  staffs" were seldom mentioned. Swingle stuck to his view that tissues  outside a developing hybrid date seed might be morphologically mod­ified  as a result of the hybridity of the developing embryo and endo­sperm,  and published several times on the subject.  Years Devoted to Citrus and the History of Chinese Botany  Swingle's chief activities and interests are rather easily classified  by the time at which they began, but it was characteristic of him that 																		2009-05-20	2009-05-20	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/wtswingle/id/132	132	133.pdfpage	/wtswingle/image/133.pdfpage

page 8																										114 ASA GRAY BULLETIN N. S. Vol. I, No. 2  His interest in Citrus therefore began before his great work of estab­lishing  date culture in the Southwest.  Swingle's Family and Friends  I knew Swingle fairly well from 1909 to 1915, but saw him after  that only on frequent visits to Washington and at scientific meetings,  the chief one being the Pacific Science Congress of 1926, at Tokyo, to  which he was a member of the official American delegation. Whenever  I visited Washington I was likely to be invited to lunch by one or an­other  member of an informal " lunch mess" to which he belonged. The  mess rented the dining room and kitchen ( for nOOns only) in one of the  old houses near the Department of Agriculture, where it had a minimum  of cooking utensils, table ware, various supplies in common, such as  rye bread, cheese, coffee, milk, etc., and where individual members  could add to the menu whatever they wanted to bring with them. Maybe  it was all arranged on a rotation basis, but to an uninformed visitor  the arrangements seemed delightfully informal and hit- or- miss.  Those who were there frequently ( whether all belonged regularly to the  mess I do not know) were Swingle, Wm. R. Maxon, T. H. Kearney,  F. V. Coville, Carl Schofield, O. F. Cook, G. N. Collins and Lyster H.  Dewey. Of this group, I am informed by Mrs. Swingle that Swingle,  Cook, Schofield and Collins all lived in one of the Maryland suburbs  of Washington and were especially close associates. In fact, after the  death of his first wife, in 1910, Swingle lived with his intimate friends,  the Cook family. In 1915 he was married a second time, to Maude  Kellerman, the daughter of his Manhattan professor, W. A. Kellerman.  She, with four sons and daughters, survives him. She was also his  associate at the Department of Agriculture in some of his most inter­esting  scientific work.  Regarding the children, I shall quote Mrs. Swingle, who writes:  " Mr. Swingle was exceedingly proud of and devoted to his four chil­dren,  the first, boy and girl twins, John and Stella ( named for his  Father and my Mother) born in 1920 after we had been married five  years; the other two, Frank and Mary, born in San Diego, in 1923 and  1928. Frank was named after Frank Thackery, with his middle name  from his maternal greatgrandfather, Anthony Dennis who was a physi­cian  of Amanda, Ohio, Mary was named for Mr. Swingle's mother.  John was named John William, the William being for my father. John  and his father used to have long arguments about every subject under  the sun. When Stella was in High School she and her father used to  take long walks while they conversed in French. Frank was becoming  the engineer while still young and he and his father had long talks  about the " dozenal" system of counting -- Frank even made a slide  rule for this system. With Mary there were long chess games.

There is an early one in Andrew Denny Rodgers'  excellent book, " Liberty Hyde Bailey," with which you are no doubt  familiar. There is one in the " Citrus Industry" published by the U. of  California Press, and one in the National Geographic in an article on  the Library of Congress ( I think this was Feb. 1951).  The Botany of Citrus  As he became older Swingle's work on Citrus came to have more  and more of a systematic turn, until it culminated in 1943 in a substan­tial  and comprehensive monograph entitled " The Botany of Citrus and  its Wild Relatives of the Orange Subfamily." This, although included  as Chapter IV in Webber and Batchelor's " The Citrus Industry" is a  substantial volume of over 400 pages as issued in the separate author's  edition. It is almost unique in presenting the coordinated taxonomy of  a whole group of cultivated and wild plants in which the descriptions  of critical structures are drawn up from type or authentic specimens  restored according to the method of Juel and sectioned. The whole re­search  was done with painstaking care, and no effort was spared to  secure adequate new material from distant and difficultly accessible  places. Such work can hardly be too highly commended.  It is interesting to note in passing that two of the genera of the  citrus allies are Merrillia, named for E. D. Merrill by Swingle, and  SWinglea, named for W. T. Swingle by Merrill. By kind permission of  Dr. Fairchild we expect in our next number to reproduce a photograph  shOwing both of these botanists with their colleagues Fairchild and  L. H.

Since his early  " I'enence had been in plant pathology, seen through spectacles well  splashed with Bordeaux mixture, one readily understands why his cit­~  US Wor, k was deeply influenced and its direction largely determined  ~ conSlderations of plant pathology. He was constantly concerned  a ut breeding disease- resistant stocks and scions. He was always  ? oncerned with the problems of propagating disease- free plants from  ~ nfected ones. This led him to experimenting with the seeds contain­~~  g false " embryos," which are well known in Citrus.

Vol. I, No. 2  newly coined term for the rejuvenescence of Citrus varieties which  had become run- down or senescent by virus or other infections which  were transmitted by ordinary methods of vegetative reproduction, by  grafting or growing from cuttings. He found that propagators could  take advantage of the curious fact that the seedlings of Citrus are often  of two kinds , namely, those derived in the ordinary way through fertili­zation  and those derived vegetatively from nucellar buds growing out  into the embryo sac. The latter, of course, reproduce the seed- parent  type with the same fidelity as any other vegetative bud, but, Swingle  found , were more likely to escape infection and could therefore be  used for starting renewed, disease- free subclones of old horticultural  varieties which had deteriorated because other methods of vegetative  propagation had resulted in carrying on accumulated infections.  He devised elaborate measures for the control of citrus canker,  and , later, for insuring by rigorous application of quarantine controls  that the dreaded " tristeza" disease of South America should not reach  the United States. Fairchild writes: " it was Swingle who first called  attention, in this country, to the terrible citrus disease ' tristeza'  which was wiping out millions of trees in Brazil and Argentina and has  since reached California."  When Swingle's mind was occupied by the threat of epidemic citrus  disease he was oblivious to most other matters and reiterated his  warnings and proposed precautions literally to all who would listen,  whenever they would listen. Reading the following in a Miami Herald's  excellent obituary must have made many of Swingle's friends fondly  recall very similar incidents, for the reporter pictured perfectly one  aspect of Swingle's strong individuality. He said: " Swingle had a mind  like a bulldog. It never let go. In an interview in 1947 at the University  of Miami, he would talk of nothing but " tristeza" disease of citrus. He  wanted to collect all kinds of citrus speCies and to test them to see  which ones were resistant to the disease, and to try them out as root­stocks  for commercial citrus.  " Two years later the tall, white- haired Swingle was attending the  Florida State Horticultural Society meeting at Tampa. When , he spied  the same reporter in the hotel lobby his face lit up with enthusiasm,  and he rushed over. ' I'm making considerable headway toward getting  that collection of citrus relatives together', he said, picking up where  he left off at the University of Miami two years before."  Permanent Collections of Breeding Materials  I am not sure whether it was Swingle or that other grand old man of  botany, Liberty Hyde Bailey, who first talked long and earnestly abOut  the desirability of assembling permanent collections in ~ xperiment  stations and botanical gardens of all the wild allies of cultivated plants, 																		2009-05-20	2009-05-20	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/wtswingle/id/136	136	137.pdfpage	/wtswingle/image/137.pdfpage

Certainly while Bailey was talking about it with speCial ref­erence  to apples, pears, grapes, and other northern economic plants  Swingle was advocating the desirability of maintaining permanent living  collections of wild and cultivated species and varieties of Citrus and  allied genera, as well as other subtropical and tropical groups. As a  matter of fact, the idea had been more or less clearly formulated in  the minds of many. If Swingle and Bailey may have been only two  among many, they were certainly among the most vigorous and out­spoken  advocates.  Swingle in the earlier years of his preoccupation with Citrus lost  no opportunity to state that a great horticultural industry based upon  two or three disease- susceptible varieties might be totally wiped out  by the introduction and running wild of a single disease. He said that  citrus canker, out of control, would wipe out the citrus industry in  Florida, that new disease- resistant hybrids could probably be produced  to guard against such a calamity, and that nobody could predict what  wild ally or old discontinued horticultural type might provide the nec­essary  genetic factor for meeting a particular emergency. So all types  of the Citrus group should be carried on, even those apparently most  Worthless. To Swingle their purely botanical interest would justify it,  but since he knew that a hard- headed and unsentimental business world  Would be unimpressed by such considerations, he emphasized the fact  that POints of departure for breeding improved fruits might be no more  necessary than breeding new types of stocks upon which to graft them.  He said that immunity to all diseases of the root might not necessarily  be easily bred into existing types of stocks upon which a current in­dustry  depended, and that breeding of new stocks from original or old  P~ ints of departure might be equally as important as producing scions  With new genetic compositions.  He advocated the testing for resistance or immunity of all known  cit~ us allies against the prevailing diseases of all citrus- growing areas.  ThiS Was to be followed by production in each country of new disease­r~  sistant varieties which were to be commerCially introduced if pos­~  ble but certainly to be held in rtlserve for emergencies. No one knew  . tter than SWingle the deep aversion of commercial growers for bother­ing  With any but two or three standard varieties. He maintained, how­~\'  er, that they should be educated up to the point of insuring their own  interests no matter how resistant to ideas they might be.  SWingle was essentially a man of ideas. They overflowed his mind,  ~~ he wanted to put them all into execution.

page 12																										118 ASA GRAY BULLETIN N. S. Vol. I, No. 2  station on an island of the Inland Sea of Japan, and others elsewhere.  Deeply imbued with caution against the danger of disease introduction  with plant introduction, he advocated the making of hybrids by the long­distance  shipment of pollen. Maude Kellerman, who became Mrs.  Swingle in October 1915, had demonstrated the practicability of keeping  pollen viable for long enough periods so that it could be shipped half­way  around the world, or bridge the time gaps between the flowering  times of different species. He wanted to make cold- resistant hybrids  in order to extend citrus culture at least up to Virginia, and argued  that it could be accomplished because the trifoliate orange, which he  set apart from Citrus as Poncirus, was hardy at Washington. The orig­inal  shrub which provided pollen for some of his first intergeneric or  at least inter- sectional pollinations stood directly in front of the old  red building of the Department of Agriculture, and a planting of its de­scendants  should be made there as a living memorial to him.  Citrus Hybrids  Swingle and his coworkers produced a great variety of botanically  interesting Citrus hybrids between widely different speCies or even  between distinct genera, to which he gave hybrid names, such as " cit­range",  and the citranges themselves included various subSidiary  horticultural varieties which are named in the conventional way. His  enthusiasm for the manifold scientific values and practical virtues of  these hybrids was boundless. I remember well his pleasure in getting  his friends in the Department to try " citrangeade". I think it was in  1910, in SWingle's office, that I became acquainted with it, after he  demonstrated the proper way to make it. He admitted that the flavor  of the essential oil from the peel was too powerful for most tastes, SO  he showed how the skin should always be peeled half way through its  thickness in a zone all the way around the fruit " at the equator." Then  the fruit should be sliced into halves through the peeled zone, when the  juice could be squeezed out without acquiring too distinctive a flavor.  I liked it even if no precautions were taken. ( I'm one of those who pre'  fer a good tangy turpentiny sour mango to a really " good" one.) Swingle  used one of his first sizable " crops" of these strange hybrid citrange  fruits for a test at a meeting in Washington and caused no little amuse'  ment by his argument that all should try to learn to like them whether  they did at once or not, because taste was something that could be cuI ·  tivated. The citranges and some of the other hybrids have met with  some acceptance for non- commercial plantings and their spontaneou~ h  segregates and secondary hybrids may be expected ultimately to ennc c'  horticulture, even if it should come about by the said process of destrU  tion of present standard fruit varieties by disease. It appears that  since Swingle's retirement some of his introductions and productionS d  have not been officially kept in recorded and controlled cultivation, all  it is of course inevitable that some would have been lost under any 																		2009-05-20	2009-05-20	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/wtswingle/id/138	138	139.pdfpage	/wtswingle/image/139.pdfpage

It is to be hoped that the University of Miami will reassem­ble  and maintain as many as possible~ It used to be said in Washington  that unless restrained by budgetary limitations Swingle would breed  more projects and jobs than a hundred others could keep going. Some  thought that he was too prolific of ideas, of which there was a plethora,  but others took his ideas pretty much at face value and wished to test  them. The latter in the long run will prove to have been the wise ones.  Swingle's First Delving into the History of  Botany and Agriculture in China  Swingle's interest in the history of Chinese botany a, nd agriculture  began with his delving into the history of cultivated types of Citrus. He  soon became broadly concerned with the history of Chinese science,  literature and culture, and from 1915 to 1935 cooperated vigorously  with Herbert Putnam, learned and far- seeing Librarian of Congress, in  building up, within the short space of fifteen years, the most carefully  chosen and largest collection of Chinese books in the Occident.  The miscellaneous minor items in the Chinese collection of the Li­brary  of Congress consisted until 1898 mostly of uncatalogued and  therefore unavailable books. The collection as a whole had not been  sufficiently rounded out to cover any special fields and therefore could  not be counted upon to serve the needs of special investigators. Never­theless  some of the choice items such as imperial and other gifts,  were basically important and highly valued. One of them, for instance,  which may have been the first Chinese herbal that Swingle studied,  was the classical Pen Ts'ao Kang Mu, edition of 1655, presented to the  United States Government in June , 1869, by the Emperor T'ung Chih.  The first move to survey the holdings came about through the courtesy  of the famous Chinese Ambassador Wu Ting- Fang, who arranged for  them to be " catalogued by some of the learned gentlemen connected  with the embassy." As a result, the report of the Librarian of Con­gress  for that year included a list of the original 2888 volumes, some  of which had been collected personally by Caleb Cushing, the first  American envoy to China. Then in 1905 the Chinese Government pre­Sented  the 1965 volumes which it had exhibited at the Louisiana Purchase  ~~~------------- . Unfortunately there is no assembled official planting of his introductions of  ~ relatives. It seems probable that the most complete collection is at the  . nlVerSlty of California at Los Angeles. There are some plants at the Univer­Sity  of Miami , some at the Plant Introduction Garden at Chapman Field and  sOlTle at the Fairchild place, The Kampong, Coconut Grove , Florida. There was  ~~ OO?

There followed, in 1908, when Theodore Roosevelt was  President, the gift of a sumptuous set of the Imperial Encyclopedia  known as the Tu Shu Chi Ch' eng, in 5041 volumes. This was brought  to Washington by a special ambassador and presented in behalf of the  Empress Dowager to the American Government as a memorial of  China's appreCiation of the remission by the United States of the last  of the indemnity for the destruction that occurred during the Boxer up­rising.  It symbolized a new era in the growth of good relations and  mutual respect between the two nations.  In the years just preceding this gift, the learned William Woodville  Rockhill, American Minister to China, had purchased personally and  presented an aggregate of about 6000 volumes, and the Chinese collec­tion  was definitely on the way toward becoming one of the important  ones in the West.  Swingle's Development of the Chinese Collection, Library of Congress  From this point its growth until 1928 was guided by Swingle, and his  interest continued for many years after that. He had originally been  interested in finding that Chinese literature of botany and agriculture  contained records of economic plants going back many hundreds of  years. The old volumes accessible to him contained references to still  older works that either were known to have survived in China and  Japan, or might turn up if searched for. So he began an unremitting  search for the important works that would supply deficiencies. At  first concerned chiefly with the old Chinese herbals and encyclopedic  works on agriculture, Swingle quickly turned his attention to the so­called  gazetteers that were compiled at intervals for the country as a  whole and for provincial as well as lesser subdivisions. These gazet­teers  actually include not only geographic descriptions but also annals  of each general or local administration, detailed local history and biog­raphy  , records of utilization of natural productions, and of the develop­ment  of manufactures, reports on official tours of inspection, and such  a vast amount of miscellaneous information that they are an inexhaust­ible  mine of facts bearing upon every phase of Chinese culture.  In 1928 Librarian Putnam expressed unstinting appreciation of  Swingle's work in his annual report: " From 1910 the collection has  been developed systematically, chiefly through the efforts of Dr. Walter  T. Swingle , to whose constant interest its present eminence is due. It  now numbers over 100,000 volumes ( Chinese), unsurpassed outside of  China and Japan." In the same report the announcement was made of  the appointment of Dr. Arthur W. Hummel as permanent chief of the  Division of Orient alia. For eight years Swingle had written the annual  reports on Far Eastern accessions, and he continued to contribute  them for the botanical, agricultural, and geographical works unti11935. 																		2009-05-20	2009-05-20	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/wtswingle/id/140	140	141.pdfpage	/wtswingle/image/141.pdfpage
page 15																										Apr. 1952 ASA GRAY BULLETIN 121  He was finally in 1947 appointed Honorary Consultant in the Develop­ment  of the Collection of Orientalia, Library of Congress, in recogni­tion  of his long continued and effective labors.  Swingle stands out among the few Americans who have contributed  to the history of Chinese science. Especially he gave our botanists an  inkling of what they may find in the ancient herbals, encyclopedias and  other source books for Chinese economic botany and ethnobotany. In  America his influence in this respect was dominant. He exerted it  largely through personal contacts, but also through his long series of  individually brief but highly effective contributions to the Annual Re­port  of the Librarian of Congress. These enumerated the most sig­nificant  Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Mongol, Manchu and Annamite  accessions, with his inspiringly enthusiastic annotations. They became  known to his botanical friends and colleagues not so much through con­sultation  of the whole volumes, which, one fears, are seldom opened  except by professional librarians and bibliographers, but through his  author's separates. As a whole they bulk largely enough so that if they  could be reprinted they would make a uniquely useful volume on the  history of botany in China, extending into the history of Chinese litera­ture,  which might well be concluded by his contr ibution to Bishop and  Koegh's " Essays Offered to Herbert Putnam."  Swingle as Exponent of Chinese Civilization  As one looks through Swingle's reports consecutively he is not only  impressed by the rapid expansion of their author ' s interests from  Chinese botany to Chinese culture in general but also by his ability to  ~ ransmit his enthusiasm to other s . He passed it on to intimate fr iends  In the Bureau of Plant Industry and to persons whom he never knew  except through cor r espondence. One of his most efficient collabora­tors  was his intimate fr iend Mr. O. F. Cook of the Bureau of Plant In­dUstry  , who, in 1919, travelled widely in China investigating cotton  Culture. With the help of his aSSistant, Mr. Yeh Yuen- Ting, and build­ing  up a speCial part of the collection which was already notable , Mr.  COok secured no less than 108 official gazetteer s in 1239 volumes. As  a result Swingle was able to r eport with pride that " the Library of  ~ ongress now [ 1920] contains the largest collection of offici. al ~ azet-ers  to be found outside of China. " In the same year a begmmng was  ~ ade in copying valuable selected manuscripts in the great. library of  anton, by a professional Chinese copyist. He had also enlisted the  ~ ooperation of the great Orientalist of the Field Museum of Chicago ,  ~ rthold Laufer, in the acquisition of Mongol books. Laufer had placed  f tanists under a lasting obligation to his s cholarship by the publica­.  ~? n of his " Sino- Iranica: Chinese Contributions to the History of Civ-tl.  lZation in Ancient Iran with Special Reference to the History of Cul-lVat  ed Plants and Produ' cts" ( Field Museum of Natural History, 																		2009-05-20	2009-05-20	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/wtswingle/id/141	141	142.pdfpage	/wtswingle/image/142.pdfpage

Vol. I, No. 2  Chicago, 1919) and was one of the few who had a proper appreciation  of Swingle's efforts in behalf of the Library of Congress.  In 1921 especially good Korean accessions were made through Dr.  lames S. Gale of Seoul. In the same year a fruitful cooperation devel­oped  with the Nanking University, one of the American Christian Col­leges  in China. Swingle in fact contacted all of the Christian Colleges,  urging them to index individual Chinese works and collectanea in se­lected  fields, and to start library schools following American models.  He arranged for Professor Harry Clemons, Librarian of Nanking Uni­versity,  to visit Washington and " to bring into final form the catalogue  of what is easily the largest and best collection of Chinese " ts'ung shu"  [ collectanea, - reprints of rare books long out of print and unavailable  separately] outside of China and lapan."  The next cordial collaborator ( 1922- 23) was Dr. U. Y. Yen, director  of the educational bureau of the Chinese Ministry of Education. In the  same year Swingle turned over to the Library of Congress a beautifully  executed manuscript copy made for him in lapan in 1915 of the " Chii Lu"  by Han Yen- Chih, written in 1178, the earliest treatise on the citrus  fruits in any language. This was made from a copy which was one of  the treasures in the private library of Professor M. Shirai of the Impe ·  rial University of Tokyo, the well- known historian of Chinese and lap­anese  botany.  In connection with this we find the first mention in the Library re­ports  of Mr. Michael 1. Hagerty. He was an employee of the Library  of Congress who was intrigued by the ease with which Chinese read  and understood their multitude of printed characters. Concluding that  there could be no insuperable difficulty about learning to read Chinese,  Hagerty began to apply himself, about 1912 , to the study of reading, of  course not speaking, and largely without instruction. His success en­abled  him to do much cataloging and translating of Chinese sources  for Swingle, so he was transferred to the Bureau of Plant Industry as  Chinese translator. Swingle was extremely pleased with Hagerty's  exploit of translating Han Yen- Chih's ancient book On citrus fruits SO  satisfactorily that Professor Pelliot, the eminent French sinologist  and editor of T'oung Pao, asked to publish it in that journal. It ap­peared  in 1923 with introduction and notes by Pelliot himself.  Mr. T. L. Yuan worked as Chinese cataloger for three years after  studying at the Albany State Library School and at Colombia University,  before returning to China, where he helped in finding desiderata for the  Library of Congress. He became librarian of the Metropolitan LibrarY  of Peking and sent various useful books as gifts.  As for these " ts'ung shu", incredibly extravagant though they may  have been as publications in comparison with reprints of single workS,  their great initial cost insured that they would be well taken care of,  and they did therefore preserve ancient works that would otherwise 																		2009-05-20	2009-05-20	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/wtswingle/id/142	142	143.pdfpage	/wtswingle/image/143.pdfpage

The bulkiest of them all, the '' Yung Lo Ta Tien" had  the objective of including all " serious works" of Chinese literature  extant in 1400, excluding novels and plays. It comprised 11 ,095 vol­urnes,  and was never printed. It existed at first in just the original  draft and one final copy. Later a new copy was made. Swingle said:  " Some 8000 years' labor of scholars was spent in compiling, copying,  and proofreading the original work, and that of another 2000 years,  first and last, in making copies and transcripts." Only scattered vol­umes  have survived, so far as known, of which the Library of Congress  has 33, and in 1922 only the Library of the Chinese Ministry of Educa­tion  had more, holding 60. A historical study of the '' Yung 1.0 Ta Tien"  by a Chinese scholar, Sun Chuang, is to be found in the Library of Con­gress  collection. A dedicatory foreword says that during a visit to  Peking, Shih Yung- kao [ no other than Walter Tennyson Swingle!] had  recognized the value of the work and had urged that a copy be made  for the Library of Congress. The obliging author complied, and sent  it with the annotation that the task of copying had been completed on the  twentieth day of the tenth month of the seventh year of the Chinese  Republic ( Oct. 20, 1918). It had probably been started in 1915, when  Swingle visited China.  Swingle was a member of the official delegation to the Pacific Sci­ence  Congress held at Tokyo in 1926, and was able to visit China and  Korea as well as Japan. So, as might have been expected, it was a  banner year for the acquisition of Oriental books. Much help was  given Swingle by former friends and benefactors of the Library of Con­gress,  such as Professor Shirai of Tokyo, Librarian T. L. Yuan of  Peking, and Professor Harry Clemons of Nanking, but gifts of unusual  interest and value were presented by Dr. Philip T. Y. Sze and Chang  Chin- Ch'eng, retired general manager of the Commercial Press, Ltd.,  of Shanghai, then perhaps the largest book publishing house in the world.  Enough names have been mentioned to indicate the nature of the  Contacts by which Swingle proceeded in building up the Chinese library,  but his responsible leadership of the enterprise, as already noted,  ce~ sed in 1928, with the appointment of a Chief of the Division of  Or1entalia, and his contributions to the Annual Report of the Librarian  of Congress in 1935.  By the time of the incorporation of a single great miscellaneous  ~ cession, that of the Wang family library ( 1928- 29), which brought  th e number of Chinese volumes in the Library of Congress up to more  C:. n 125,000, Swingle had got to the point of writing in this vein: [ The  be lnese have] " the oldest continuous civilization of high standard to  st found in the world today.

Western scholars, in spite of all the  good work they have done in the study of Chinese have barely scratched  the surface of this field. Until after the revolution of 1911 foreign  scholars had practically no access to any important Chinese official Of  family library."  If it had been possible within the capacity and life span of a busy  professional man, Swingle would have plowed deeply, not merely  scratched, the whole field himself. He could only hope that possession  of this great national treasure by the United States, a library epitomiZ­ing  the civilization of China, might attract the gift of an endowment " to  insure the actiVe and efficient utilization of these books which are the  best and most trustworthy records of the attainments , the aspirations,  and the hopes of the Chinese people."

The books were hidden away, however, and when the edict  requiring the destruction of literary works was repealed in 190 B. C.,  everyone was encouraged to bring forth the ancient books. The forma­tiO!  l of a great Imperial Library went forward. By 124 B. C. the resto­ration  and study of the classics was provided for in the Chinese proto­type  of a university.  Needless to say, living tradition will bridge the gap of a generation  in maintaining the continuity of Chinese civilization, quite regardless  of how thoroughly the apostles of Stalin may try to stamp it out. Never­theless  , the tidal wave of cultural destruction may sweep so clean that  the Chinese Collection in Washington may come to have great impor­tance  in the Chinese cultural renaissance to which we shall look for­ward,  and for which we should help to prepare by making the Library  of Congress a haven of refuge for Chinese scholars of the old tradition.  Swingle was such an enthusiast about Chinese botanical and agricul­tural  literature that he never lost an opportunity to tell all who would  listen that encyclopedias were apparently a Chinese invention, maybe  older than the Chinese art of printing from engraved wooden blocks;  that incorporation in great reprint collections, seemingly a wasteful  type of publication, saved many valuable individual works from obliv­ion;  that the author of an illustrated work on Chinese agriculture, Wang  Cheng of the Yuan dynasty, may have been the first to make extensive  use of movable type; that Ts'ai Lun, who laid his invention of paper be­fore  the throne in 105 A. D. and revolutionized book production was  thereby the greatest of all practical technologists in utilization of bo­tanical  products whose name as an individual survives in world history;  : md that the printer's art " from the manufacture of paper, printer's  Ink, blocks for printing, and movable type, both engraved and cast, as  Well as printing presses themselves, were all invented by the Chinese  and Used by them centuries before they were used in any other country.  It, i~ no exaggeration to say that printing on paper is the basic art of  CIVIlization, without which civilization itself could not exist in its pres­ent  form."

Only a few years  ago I had the good fortune to assist from afar in the discovery of a vil­lage  in south China where these ants were still grown and sold to the  orange farmers, just as described ages ago in accounts not before given  credence in western countries ... In foods we have everything to learn  from the Chinese who support life on one cent a day and have worked  out by centuries of experience, tasty, digestible, and nourishing dietar­ies  of ridiculously low cost. They have discovered literally scores of  highly nutritious and extremely tasty preparations made from the soy  bean such as milk, curd, cottage cheese, fermented cheese, sauces like  the famous soy sauce - in fact a whole shop full of products, while we  are barely able to utilize the soy bean for human food and in fact usu­ally  do not use it for human food at all." Some derided Swingle's en­thusiasms  as evidence of credulity, but he pursued them indefatigably  to ultimate scientific gain and practical benefit.  Swingle's participation in building up the Chinese collections in the  Library of Congress was one of his major accomplishments. That col­lection  may well become one of the chief repositories through which  Chinese culture will survive the pestilential scourge of Russian com­munism.  If so, Swingle and Putnam will have built better than they  could have known, for there must be much in the age- old Chinese cul­ture  that the world will again need when the present tidal wave of bar­barism  shall have spent itself.  Sometimes Swingle's enthusiasm for things Chinese caused his  hearers to smile incredulously, but he could put up a strong argument  for retaining almost any venerable Chinese institution, or at least mak ·  ing sure that it did not pass away without the most searching SCientifiC  appraisal, and then by a process of evolution. Most persons were in­clined  to think that China did well to modernize in giving up the ancient  system of examinations in the classics for appointment to official posi­tions.  Swingle thought otherwise. He pointed out that by the old sys­tem  selection of major officials was strictly competitive and all were  eligible for the qualifying examinations. Everyone who passed was  assured of appointment. There was no preference list, no deferment,  and no favoritism. Officials never served in their own districts, where  they might be called upon by family and friends for favors that should  not properly or justly be granted. If they became corrupt, it was then  through sheer human fallibility. As a result of having a civil service  based upon examination, open to all, for which the best brains of China  were sought out, every locality, no matter how rude or underdeveloped  culturally, had officials who were learned men.  In his thinking Swingle was characteristically capable of jumping a  startlingly wide gulf, for his' mind did not always follow a smooth path  of transition, and he could turn all of a sudden from the selection of  civil servants to the geography of book publication, in the end relatingd  the two subjects quite satisfactorily. He was fond of saying that in 0  1 																		2009-05-20	2009-05-20	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/wtswingle/id/146	146	147.pdfpage	/wtswingle/image/147.pdfpage
page 21																										Apr. 1952 ASA GRAY BULLETIN 127  China a printing establishment could be set up by merely cutting down  the nearest wild pear tree , and then having the village carpenter make  uniform smooth blocks of the wood. Processes that followed were  pasting carefully prepared manuscript face down on the blocks , cutting  the wood away to leave elevated characters or illustrations, as a type  face, and finally , printing. This could all be done in one place as well  as another, so there was never any centralization of printing in old  China. With scholars widely dispersed as a result of the civil- service  policy, with every scholar anxious to make a name for himself in lit­erature,  and with equally good facilities for publication everywhere,  book production was enormous. So, for a thousand years, the rate of  publishing books was greater in China than in all the rest of the world  put together , and this was true up to the eighteenth century.  Chinese social structure was also defended by Swingle. He was  vastly irritated, for example , by those who thought that treatment of  aged parents in China was foolish and uneconomic , and that Chinese  family life in general was badly arranged. On the contrary, he was in  advance of anthropologists of the sociological school in asking: " Does  it not seem worth the effort, while this ancient civilization still exists,  to see for ourselves what the Chinese have found that is of value for  us, especially since by giving them due credit for their discoveries,  We benefit them and ourselves by creating a new and stable basis for  esteem where at present prejudice, based on ignorance for the most  part, rules supreme? " At the same time, he exclaimed: " What a  World lies open to us if only we have the sense to study while it can  still be studied and to study with an open mind and a sympathetic  heart!" So spoke one who was sociologist and humanist as well as  botanist. The devastating calamity of Russian- style communism has  now overwhelmed China, a country whose people have had more sense  of genuine social obligation and have put more mutual helpfulness into  practice than the Russians have ever dreamed of.  . SWingle was one of the most interesting and useful men of the bril­hant  foundation period of the U. S. Department of Agriculture. His  name deserves a high place on the honor roll of American botanists  and humanists.  REFERENCES  Anon. , Dr. Walter T. Swingle , Authority on Citrus Botany, dies at 81.

Swingle wrote today saying that you were compiling  a biographical sketch of Dr. Swingle to appear in the Asa Gray Bulletin,  and asking that I send to you some information on the Swingle Research  Project here , and data concerning Dr. Swingle's technical library.  We have attempted to compile a complete list of Dr. Swingle's pub­lications  , and at present this list contains 256 items. It has been com­piled  from a great many sources, but probably is not complete as Dr.  Swingle's writings were printed in so many different periodicals. We  do feel sure that it contains the bulk of the significant papers. I am  enclosing a copy of this list, and hope it may be of some assistance to  you.  Dr. Swingle arranged to turn his technical library over to the Uni­versity  of Miami, and the bulk of it was transferred to the University  Library in December, 1951. These materials are still undergoing  processing, accessioning, etc. at the library, and so final figures on  the size and value of the collection have not yet been completed; the  collection contained between 17,000 and 20,000 volumes, many of  which are virtually unobtainable today. 																		2009-05-20	2009-05-20	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/wtswingle/id/150	150	151.pdfpage	/wtswingle/image/151.pdfpage
page 25																										ni­ity  Apr. 1952 ASA GRAY BULLETIN 131  Early in 1948 Dr. Swingle suggested that the University maintain  as nearly a complete arboretum of Citrus and Citrus relatives as pos­sible,  as many of the genera and species which he had so painstakingly  assembled while preparing " The Botany of Citrus and its Wild  Relatives of the Orange Subfamily" were being lost. The University  accepted this suggestion, and at the present time 18 of the 33 genera  included in the Aurantioideae are being grown and maintained at the  University. We plan to continue and enlarge this collection, the ob­jectives  being to have eventually as complete a collection of the gen­era  and species as possible. Already this collection has proved use­ful  for identification of varieties, to persons interested in rootstock  experiments, and in several phases of experimentation concerning  Tristeza disease.  When Dr. Swingle became Consultant in Tropical Botany at the  University of Miami in 1941 , he was engaged in the completion of his  taxonomic monograph on the Citrus sub- family; this work was, as you  are probably familiar , done in collaboration with the U. S. Dept. of  Agriculture, and technical facilities and an assistant, Dr. Albert H.  Tillson, were provided by the Department at the Glenn Dale, Md.,  Station for the work. Dr. Swingle had found so many of the type spec­imens  of these plants so fragmentary that he adopted a technique de­veloped  by H. O. Juel for " restoring" critical portions of a herbarium  specimen so that the resulting restored specimen could be sectioned  by the paraffin method and made into permanent slides suitable for  microscopic study. This method made possible the easy separation  of genera and speCies formerly in doubt, as anatomical and morpho­logical  characters of the flowers and fruits were clearly established.  D~. Tillson compiled a reference collection of over 250,000 serial  mIcrotome sections in the course of this work.  Dr. Swingle was so impressed by the effectiveness of the method  and by the aid it provided in establishing char acters of taxonomic im­iortance  in the Aurantioideae, that he urged the University of Miami  o~ un. dertake a long- range pr oject to compile a reference collection  . slides of serial sections of the cr itical parts of all t r opical econom­IC  plants and their wild relatives. The collection was to be used in  ~:~:. al anat. omical and mor phological studies, and as an aid to tax-  IC studIes of tr opical economic plant groups.  le ; he Univer sity saw the value of establis hing such a r efer ence col­te~  IOn of s lides, and also of conducting investigations based on the  swttence collection, and so began in 1942 what is now known as the  und: gle Research Project. I had beel' Dr. Swingle's assistant as an  to 1 rgraduate stUdent at the Univer sity, and was sent to Glenn Dale  1' iuearn the techniques of Juel which had been perfected by Dr.  Pte: Z: i t. he prOject was begun on a full- time basis in 1943. At the  hme the reference collection of slides encompasses over a 																		2009-05-20	2009-05-20	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/wtswingle/id/151	151	152.pdfpage	/wtswingle/image/152.pdfpage

As an outgrowth of this project we are at the present  time engaged in basic anatomical and morphological studies, as well  as taxonomic investigations.  The project maintains its own reference library in the fields of  Plant Anatomy, Morphology, and Taxonomy, and includes over 4,000  titles at the present time. This collection is being rapidly expanded.  If I can be of any further help to you in your preparation of the bio­graphical  sketch, please feel free to call upon me. I should be de­lighted  to have several copies of the number of the Asa Gray Bulletin  in which your article appears.  Sincerely,  Frank D. Venning,  Research Assistant Professor  AN INTERESTING SERIES OF POPULAR ARTICLES  ON PALMS CULTIVATED IN FLORIDA  AN INTERESTING SERIES OF POPULAR ARTICLES ON PALMS CUL­TIV  ATED IN FLORIDA - Inquiry was made to the Miami Herald to find  out who had written the sympathetic and understanding obituary of w.  T. Swingle which appeared in that paper. It was by Nixon Smiley, their  Farm and Garden Editor, who writes the Herald's excellent horticul­tural  page. The " Herald" is currently running Mr. Smiley's illustrated  articles on the cultivated palms of Florida. These should ultimately  be assembled for republication in a more permanent form. They would  do much to increase popular knowledge of one of the most interesting  families of plants, and one which is unfortunately too much neglected  even by botanists. The originality and quality of Mr. Smiley's page is  well illustrated by the Herald's issue of March 9, kindly sent me by  Mrs. Maude K. Swingle, which has a leading article in the form of a  greeting to Wilson Popenoe on his 60th birthday. Popenoe's name wiIl  come to be associated with that of Fairchild in the field of tropical  horticulture, for although Popenoe has devoted himself to many good  works he is perhaps thought of especially in connection with some of  Fairchild's favorite introductions, choice varieties of mango and aVo'  cado. Smiley's article appeared exactly on Wilson Popenoe's birth­dayl  Such commemorative foresight is most unusual, but it was stiIll'  ulated by a very unusual man. We join belatedly in wishing popenoe  many more productive years. - H. H.
