Letter from Thomas Jefferson  to Tench Coxe		Jefferson, Thomas, 1743-1826		During Jefferson's second term as President, he was preoccupied with keeping the United States from involvement in the Napoleonic wars. His letter to Tench Coxe (1755-1824), a prominent Philadelphian who served as purveyor of public supplies in Jefferson's administration, primarily discusses the possibilities of establishing an American militia, but also expresses some of the above-mentioned reservations towards involvement with Europe's problems.
