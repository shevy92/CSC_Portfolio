Fantasy in neon, Collins Avenue, Miami Beach		Night view, with moon partly behind clouds, of the Raleigh, the Ritz Plaza, the National, the Sands, and the New Yorker Hotels.	Architect L. Murray Dixon designed the Raleigh in the Streamline Modern Style; it opened in 1940. Dixon also designed The Ritz Plaza (originally the Grossinger Beach Hotel), the first air-conditioned hotel on Miami Beach, in 1939. After being used in World War II by the U.S. Armed Forces' top officers, it re-opened in 1946 as the Ritz, and has since been designated a national historic landmark.  The 12-storey National Hotel was built in 1939 by architect Roy F. France and was the first on the scene during the Art Deco heyday. It underwent restoration in 1996-1997, and was honored with the Miami Design Preservation League's Hall of Fame Award and the Dade Heritage Trust Preservation Award for Excellence in Art Deco Preservation. The New Yorker Hotel, built by Henry Hohauser in 1939, was considered to be Hohauser's greatest work and a masterpiece of Art Deco design, but was demolished in 1981.

Million Dollar Pier, Miami Beach, Fla.		Beach-goers and swimmers flock around the pier.	The Million Dollar Pier was constructed by Ohio businessman George R. K. Carter at the southern tip of Miami Beach in the late 1920s. The pier was damaged in both the 1926 and 1928 hurricanes, but Carter repaired it and added a restaurant and casino, spending so much money that it became known as "the Million-Dollar Pier." City of Miami Beach officials demolished it in 1985.	Piers; Million Dollar Pier (Miami Beach, Fla.); Tourist attractions	Postcards	J. N.
