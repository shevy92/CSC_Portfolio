Letter from Ralph Munroe to Vincent Gilpin, June 5, 1930		Munroe, Ralph, 1851-1933		The letter includes commentary on the Pancoast family, who were South Florida entrepreneurs. "Yesterday was called upon by Clayton Sedgwick Cooper, writer & lecturer well known here for several years past. His wife, not with him at the time and whom our people know, is also a writer of moment, one of her recent productions is "My Lady of the Chinese Court-yard" is having a big sale. A Mrs. Pancoast who brought Cooper here is a daughter of Collins who was associated with Field & [?] in the coconut-planting along the coast in the eighties. When this project slumped Collins to [i.e., took] a large portion of the land, built the big bridge & started Miami Beach. His daughter who married Pancoast is a very charming old lady, all of old Quaker stock from Moorstown, NJ. It seems that Miami Beach aside from the fast set really has very many nice people living there who apparently are in some control and anxious to do things as near right as possible and among these things is a combined Directory & History of the Beach and have gotten this Mr. Cooper interested in its make up and the first thing confronting him was that Com. Munroe was about publishing a story of Biscayne Bay that practically and probably would absorb most of his thunder, hence his call on me. I briefly outlined the plan of our book, which somewhat relieved him as he now thinks it quite possible to so compile his work that there will be no interference and on the contrary some mutual benefit [?] I think him very much of a gentleman therefore threw no cold water and suggested that he call on you which he enthusiastically agreed to. His long experience may be of value if nothing else. Wrote you a few days ago about the title telling you to use your own good judgment as usual. Fine weather again but I've got a very leaky roof over the Herreshoff cottage on my hands..."		Cooper, Clayton Sedgwick, 1869-1936	Correspondence		1930-06-05-1930-06-05		Florida. Miami-Dade county.

Letter from Wirth Munroe to Patty Munroe Catlow			Munroe, Wirth, d. 1968	Wirth Munroe's letter to his sister Patty describes the proposed building of a new causeway across Biscayne Bay and a boat he designed, the Pirouette. In part, he writes, "There is not much to say that Mary hasn't already put on paper - what with politics and traffic problems there is never any letup to the constant fight to preserve some resemblance of sanity to the area. The enclosed clippings are just a small portion of what I keep getting myself into - Another thing is the mid Bay Causeway which the county wants to build from Ojus or head of the bay, to McArthur (old county) causeway. This has been on the fire for many years after being started by old R.C. Gardner. It would split the north bay in two parts, the [?] part the smaller Fla. Dade County Marine Council, a division of the Dade County Chamber of Commerce, is very much against the causeway. It all looks like a long fight. I have been put on that committee by this Marine Council. My trip to Martinique was interesting but worrisome because there was so much here at home to do. Not everyone can get such a trip and get paid for it besides. Came back from San Juan in 2 hr 10 min on a PAA jet at 25,000 ft. Saw some of the Bahamas but the clouds were thick from Acklins Is. to the time we came down below [?] over the streams."		Causeways; Munroe, Wirth, d. 1968	Correspondence				Florida.

Letter from Ralph Munroe to Vincent Gilpin, July 3, 1926		Munroe, Ralph, 1851-1933		Letter from Ralph Munroe to Vincent Gilpin, July 3, 1926. Munroe describes land speculation activities (of which he is critical) and purchases of land around Coconut Grove for development. On page 2 he describes these as "a first class 17th century bit of piracy on the Spanish Main." Munroe talks about sailing, which both correspondents enjoyed. From page 3: "I mentioned Coral Gables in connection with our water front troubles. The first two years of their work at the back of us [i.e., behind Munroe's estate] certainly did not appeal to me. The Spanish architecture buildings and various other features rubbed me against the grain. The Cocoplum development, now well underway shows a great change for the better. I am pleased so far and tho the whole movement has been a nightmare to me I am becoming reconciled and can visualize something very beautiful to come from it and possibly unequaled by anything other similar movement in the world." On page 4, Munroe describes a meeting with Leo Baekeland, who invented Bakelite plastic.	Vincent Gilpin co-authored with Ralph Middleton Munroe the book "The Commodore's Story," an autobiography of boatmaker, photographer and Coconut Grove pioneer Ralph Munroe.

Letter from Ralph M. Munroe to Vincent Gilpin, July 6, 1918		Munroe, Ralph, 1851-1933		This letter, from entrepreneur Ralph Munroe to Vincent Gilpin, a winter resident of Coconut Grove, contains discussion of wartime activity, the Dinner Key Aviation School, and labor shortage. From p. 1: "All that was asked for further than the Jersey Red paint was a proper fly swatter to keep off the eight or ten breeds of [airplanes] that incessantly buzz around..."  From p. 2: "Have received almost positive assurance that the Aviation School will not be maintained after the war so feel better. Would now like to stop the evident graft in the ceaseless dredging going on around Dinner Key. Here we are skimping and paying double & treble prices for everything, and the blasted dredging company getting rich on thieving." From p. 3: "We are in great straits for labor. Camp work seems impossible. Am building chimneys with the help of an old English Boer War soldier. Can get a darky occasionally @ 2.50 per [day] to cut grass. Our boy Ed Bunyon was conscripted and is at Camp Wright, NJ freezing to death. All other labor is now at the new Army Aviation camp just this side of Cutler Hammock where they do as little as possible at highest pay so as to help the contractors earn millions on the percentage basis."	Vincent Gilpin co-authored with Ralph Middleton Munroe the book "The Commodore's Story," an autobiography of boatmaker, photographer and Coconut Grove pioneer Ralph Munroe.
