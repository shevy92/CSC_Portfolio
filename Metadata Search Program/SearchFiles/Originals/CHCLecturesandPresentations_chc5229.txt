Program													THE GEORGETOWN CLUB OF MIAMI  ANNUAL VISITING PROFESSOR LECTURE  Thursday, March 3rd, 2011  Reception at 6:00 p.m. Lecture and Q&A session at 7:00 p.m.  Roberto C. Goizueta Pavilion, Otto G. Richter Library 1300 Memorial Drive (Second Floor), Coral Gables Seating is limited. RSVP by February 28 to 305-284-4900 or chc@miami.edu.  Many of the Cuban-American literary writers who have risen to national and even international prominence since the nineties grew up outside of the island and often outside of the diaspora’s epicenter in South Florida as well. Dr. Ortíz will explore this phenomenon of dislocation and whether it impacts any claim that Cuban-American literature might have of representing the Cuban-American experience. Dr. Ortíz will also address how the Cuban-American experience and its cultural representation might evolve as Miami’s Latino population becomes more diversified and as more Cuban-Americans settle well beyond the boundaries of the enclave.  Dr. Ricardo Ortíz is Associate Professor in the English Department at Georgetown University. He is the author of Testimonial Fictions: the Post-Dictatorship Mode in US Latino Literature and Culture (forthcoming) and Cultural Erotics in Cuban America (University of Minnesota Press, 2007).

Program													Monday, November 22, 2010  Reception at 6:00 p.m. and lecture at 6:30 p.m.  Roberto C. Goizueta Pavilion, Otto G. Richter Library 1300 Memorial Drive (Second Floor), Coral Gables  This presentation provides an overview of the afrocubanismo movement, a pan-artistic phenomenon in the 1920s and 1930s, similar to the Harlem Renaissance. Dr. Moore explores the fundamentally ambivalent attitudes about Afro-Cuban culture associated with the period, and the ways in which composers created highly stylized and often stereotyped representations of working-class Afro-Cuban music for circulation in the concert hall and commercial marketplace.  Dr. Robin Moore is Professor of Ethnomusicology at the University of Texas at Austin.

Program													Cuban Heritage Collection Scholars Series  La Conexión Cubana  Narcotráfico, contrabando y juego en Cuba  entre los años 20 y comienzos de la Revolución  Una presentación de Eduardo Sáenz Rovner  Profesor, Universidad Nacional de Colombia  Martes, 11 de enero del 2005  5:30 p.m.  Roberto C. Goizueta Pavilion  2º piso de la Biblioteca Otto G. Richter de la Universidad de Miami, 1300 Memorial Drive, Coral  Gables  Eduardo Sáenz Rovner es profesor en la Universidad Nacional de Colombia. Obtuvo su Ph.D. en  Historia en Brandeis University en 1989. Ha sido Visiting Professor en University of California, Los  Angeles (UCLA) en 1992 y 1998 y Visiting Scholar en University of Miami en 2002‐2003. Es autor de los  libros La ofensiva empresarial. Industriales, políticos y violencia en Colombia en los años 40 (1992) y Colombia  años 50. Industriales, política y diplomacia (2002).  En su nuevo libro, Narcotráfico, contrabando y juego en Cuba entre los años 20 y comienzos de la Revolución,  Sáenz Rovner subraya la dinámica economía de Cuba y su gran integración a las corrientes migratorias  y al comercio internacional durante las primeras décadas del siglo XX. El autor afirma que en cuanto al  narcotráfico la isla fue un importante lugar de paso de diferentes sustancias psicoactivas hacia el  mercado norteamericano. Teniendo en cuenta el carácter cosmopolita de Cuba, en especial de La  Habana, los grupos de traficantes estaban compuestos tanto por cubanos como por inmigrantes quienes  desarrollaron redes con Europa, el Medio Oriente, Sudamérica, México y los Estados Unidos.  Esta presentación forma parte de la Scholars Series de la Cuban Heritage Collection (CHC) de la Biblioteca  de la Universidad de Miami. CHC patrocina esta serie para diseminar la obra de estos investigadores y  resaltar el modo en que los materiales de la CHC apoyan los estudios cubanos y cubano‐americanos. El  Centro de Estudios Latinoamericanos (CLAS) de la Universidad de Miami se une al CHC en patrocinar  la presentación del profesor Sáenz Rovner.

Program													Cuban Heritage Collection  200 Years of Cuban Children’s Books  Exhibition opening with a presentation by  Antonio Orlando Rodríguez  “Un paseo por la literatura cubana para niños y adolescentes.”  Thursday, January 31, 2008  6:00 p.m.  Roberto C. Goizueta Pavilion, Otto G. Richter Library  1300 Memorial Drive, 2nd Floor, Coral Gables, Florida  Nostalgia and history intertwine in this exhibition of Cuban children’s literature presented by the Cuban Heritage Collection of the University of Miami Libraries. The ideas and ideals expressed in a child’s book can influence the reader for the rest of his or her life. It is with this in mind that the books included in this exhibition were chosen: they have had a lasting impact on the Cuban imagination and consciousness. The featured books range from the nineteenth to the twenty-first century and include every genre, from cuentos to poetry to primers. They are written by Cubans both in and outside the island, and each one highlights the author’s unique perspective.  At the opening of this exhibition, noted author and expert on children’s literature Antonio Orlando Rodríguez will discuss “Un paseo por la literatura cubana para niños y adolescentes.”  RSVP to 305-284-4008 or chc@miami.edu by Monday, January 28, 2008  http://library.miami.edu/chc/ 														chc5229000001	chc52290000010001001			application/pdf		chc5229000001.pdf		2012-09-07	2012-09-07	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/chc5229/id/36	36	45.pdf	/chc5229/image/45.pdf

Program													Cuban Heritage Collection Scholars Series  Journey to the Origins:  Lydia Cabrera’s Laguna Sagrada  A presentation by Madeline Cámara  Professor of Hispano-American Literature, University of South Florida  Friday, October 15, 2004 at 4:30 p.m.  Roberto C. Goizueta Pavilion  Otto G. Richter Library (2nd Floor), University of Miami  1300 Memorial Drive, Coral Gables, Florida  NOTE: This presentation is in Spanish. En español.  Madeline Cámara is professor of Hispano-American literature in the World Language Education Department of the University of South Florida in Tampa. She received degrees from the University of Havana and the Colegio de México and a PhD from the State University of New York en Stony Brook. The recipient of a Fulbright Fellowship in 2001, Dr. Cámara is the author of several books La letra rebelde: estudios de escritoras cubanas (Miami: Ediciones Universal, 2002). In her presentation, Dr. Cámara explores the concept of “poetic consciousness” that the Spanish philosopher María Zambrano proposes to characterize the way in which Lydia Cabrera’s writing approaches the African roots of Cuban culture. Cámara maintains that research and poetry are inseperable in the work of Lydia Cabrera and proposes that Cabrera can also be studied as a pioneer of postmodern ethnography.  This presentation forms part of the University of Miami’s Cuban Heritage Collection Scholars Series. Every year, scholars from our University and other institutions around the world conduct in-depth research using the extensive holdings of the Cuban Heritage Collection (CHC). The CHC is sponsoring presentations by these scholars to highlight their work and emphasize the ways in which the CHC’s research collection support today’s scholarship in Cuban and Latin American studies.

Los Origenes: La Laguna Sagrada de Lydia Cabrera	Journey to the Origins: Lydia Cabrera's Laguna Sagrada		Cámara, Madeline	University of Miami Libraries. Cuban Heritage Collection.		Madeline Cámara is professor of Hispano-American literature in the World Language Education Department of the University of South Florida in Tampa. She received degrees from the University of Havana and the Colegio de México and a PhD from the State University of New York in Stony Brook. The recipient of a Fullbright Fellowship in 2001, Dr. Cámara is the author of several books La letra rebelde: estudios de escritoras cubanas (Miami: Ediciones Universal, 2002). In her presentation, Dr. Cámara explores the concept of ""poetic consciousness"" that the spanish philosopher María Zambrano proposes to characterize the way in which Lydia Cabrera's writing approaches the African roots of Cuban culture. Cámara maintains that research and poetry are inseperable in the work of Lydia Cabrera and proposes that Cabrera can also be studied as a pioneer of postmodern ethnography. Lecture was presented as part of the Cuban Heritage Collection Scholars Series.

In this picture, Deputy Chair María R. Estorino is giving her an overview of our website, search tools, and digital collections while UM President Donna E. Shalala looks on. Ms. Sánchez has repeatedly indicated that technology tools and access to information as two of the most important things that Cubans on the island need. We did our part to answer this call by giving her 10 flash drives loaded with a selection of materials digitized from the CHC’s holdings, including four of the over 100 interviews we have conducted as part of our Luis J. Botifoll Oral History Project. Ms. Sánchez has been on a whirlwind tour of various countries since she was allowed to leave Cuba in February. After stops in Brazil, the Czech Republic, Spain, and New York, she arrived in Miami last week and spoke yesterday at Miami Dade College’s Freedom Tower and at Florida International University. You can read about her tour in her own words and pictures on her blog Generación Y (or translated into English on Generation Y), on Twitter @yoanisanchez, and Instagram.														chc5229000016	chc52290000160001001			application/pdf		chc5229000016.pdf		2013-05-29	2013-05-29	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/chc5229/id/94	94	97.pdf	/chc5229/image/97.pdf
