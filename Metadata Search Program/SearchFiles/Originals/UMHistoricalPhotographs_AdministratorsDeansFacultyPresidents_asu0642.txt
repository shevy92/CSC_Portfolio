Bill Nagle (left), President of Kappa Pi and Jerome Sanders (right), holding a portrait of Bowman F. Ashe, President of the University of Miami	Fisher, Ray			Kappa Pi is the University of Miami National Art Fraternity. Its president at the moment, Bill Nagle, was one of the students who discovered the painting ability of Jerome Sanders. Sanders was a graduate of George Washington Carver high school who painted the oil portrait of late President Bowman F. Ashe in his spare time from janitorial duties at the University's Merrick building. When UM President Jay F.W. Pearson accepted the portrait from Sanders, he expressed that the artist had caught a remarkable likeness of Dr. Ashe, even though he had never seen the late UM President and his only model was a newspaper picture of Dr. Ashe.

Bill Nagle (left), President of Kappa Pi, and Jerome Sanders (right); holding a portrait of Bowman F. Ashe, President of the University of Miami	Fisher, Ray		Kappa Pi is the University of Miami National Art Fraternity. Its president at the moment, Bill Nagle, was one of the students who discovered the painting ability of Jerome Sanders. Sanders was a graduate of George Washington Carver high school who painted the oil portrait of late President Bowman F. Ashe in his spare time from janitorial duties at the University's Merrick building. When UM President Jay F.W. Pearson accepted the portrait from Sanders, he expressed that the artist had caught a remarkable likeness of Dr. Ashe, even though he had never seen the late UM President and his only model was a newspaper picture of Dr. Ashe.
