With her tape recorder, she explores the rich heritage of Creole Louisiana, but Mammy, Ella's primary informant, dies during the project. From beyond the grave she continues to transmit messages. Although the academically-minded Ella is dubious about the authenticity of the medium, gradually, as she confronts her prejudices, the tapes convey enriching mysteries about the past lives of Mammy and her friend Lowly. From this supernatural experience Ella learns much about herself and her background.

Edgell, the first internationally published novelist of Belize, discusses her novels and the effect of Belizean culture on her writing. She explains the multiculturality and ethnic groupings in Belize, including Mayas, mestizas, the Garifuna people (free African Maroons), and Creoles. She talks about women in literature, the differing values men and women hold in the Caribbean, and her novel Beka Lamb. Burdige gives her perspective of being an American writer at the CWSI, and she and Baugh discuss ethnicity, regionality and universality in literature. Burdige describes one of her short stories, “Vacations,” about a tourist visiting an island, and reads a passage from it. Edgell reveals that most of the conference attendees accepted Burdige and forgot she was not a Caribbean woman; she reads a passage from her fiction.

He shows where Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, and Jamaica are on the map and describes those islands briefly. Baugh interviews Barbadian novelist Kwadwo Kamau about his life and work as an immigrant to the United States. Next, Baugh interviews Rawle Frederick, Trinidadian author of poetry and short stories, about his life and work as an immigrant in Montreal, Canada, in Tanzania, and in Bermuda, where Frederick teaches and which Baugh jokingly refers to as "an honorary West Indian island." Baugh then talks with Randi Kristensen, a graduate student at Louisiana State University in sociology, an activist for immigrants whose homelands were affected by U.S. foreign policies, and an aspiring writer. Having spent her life traveling back and forth between Jamaica and America, she is interested in how people cope with differences in gender, culture, and class and argues that the "melting pot" is not the right metaphor for America, which must learn to accept differences. Baugh asks Frederick and Kamau about their experiences attending the CWSI. Kamau talks about his Barbadian grandmother and Baugh notes that grandmothers are often as influential as mothers in the Caribbean. The speakers comment on the influence of their travels on their writings.
