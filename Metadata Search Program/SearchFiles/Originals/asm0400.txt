Paper  Kirkpatrick  Those who attended the meeting of  the Woi!'an's Club yesterday afternoon w&lt; an intellectual treat  that will l)o long-remembered. The  afternoon was in charge of Mrs. A. B.  Frederick, president of the state federation of Woman's clubs, who read  an excellent account of the religion  of Russia, and then introduced Mrs.  Kirkpatrick who read the following |  article, illustrating portions of it by  a fine collection of Madonna pictures  which she discussed in a most appreciating way.  The paper which was introduced  by a few paragraphs pertaining to  the Russian treatment of the Madonna pictures, as the Woman's Club is  studying Russia this season, is subjoined:  Russian MaGonnas.  Byzantine art is a sacerdotal hier-  chal art, immutable, unchangeable;  for it no Rennassaince has dawned.  The same rigid laws govern it now,  laws as fixed as those of the Medes  and Persians, as bound it in thrall in  its birth. To paraphrase Byron, "Such  as creation's dawn beheld, behold it  now." In the tenth century a pa'.nter  monk gathered up all the rules then  extant for sacred pictures and wrote  them into a "Handb'ook of Painting."  During all the succeeding centuries  not a "jot or tittle" has been added  to them; and today in the studios of  Mt. Athos, wThere are trained all the  artists of Russian churches, this handbook is read aloud by a young monk  while the  painters work.  There is no attempt at individual- j  ity;   the  greatest  painter  is  he who I  copies most minutely the colo-is and !  patterns   prescribed.     As   no   carved I  figures     are     allowed     in     Russian;  churches   all   Madonnas   are   painted  flat,  or  done   in  mosaics,   the   face.-?  dark    and    middle-aged.    There are  three   special   Madonnas   famous   in i  Russia,  one  in  Moscow  and  two   in !  Kief.  The one in Moscow- is at the Siberian Gate chapel, one of the entrances  of the Kremlin, where the C//ar always pays his devotions. She is considered- a miracle worker and healer  and is in much demand at the bedsides of the wealthy. On these occasions she is carried in solemn procession through the streets previously cleared of all Jews by the authorities, for the blessed virgin must not  be contaminated by'the gaze of any  Jew. Kief possesses the oldest Madonna, sacred for ages, done In mosaic on a wall of an ancient ch.jvcli  and incorporated into a later one.  This is called "The Indestructible  Wall," and this Madonna is mach  venerated.    „  In another cathedral hangs a famous Madonna peculiar, in that the  picture is held up by cords and let  down when the crowds worship on  holy days.

The Madonna  is the universal type of motherhood.  She should appeal to all, for no one  is too ignorant to understand, non#  too wise to be superior to tivr cnaj ui.  Why, then, should not we Protestant  women join our Roman Catholic sisters in their admiration and love of  this glorified type of womankind. Certainly she was pure, chaste, of noole  character, tnis spotless flower of  womanhood and was exalted for a  most holy purpose. So highly was she  favored of God that He chose her to  be the mother of His Son. No other  woman has had such honors as have  been heaped upon this lowly Jewish  maiden. About her figure there plays  a halo whose brightness no time  may dim; in her image the beauty  worship of the ages culminated.  From unknown painters of the Byzantine period to the artists of our  own day each master has handled the  subject in a different manner, given it  some fresh expression of sentiment,  some original touch of invention and  imagery. At first all pictures of the  Madonna were supposed to be copies  of the painting by St. Luke, said to  have been found by- the Empress Eu-  docia at Jerusalem, and sent to Constantinople; from there it was taken  to Venice and placed in St. Marks. It  was over 400 years before the virgin  was represented as a mother, and her  worship as the "Mother of God" began, and so the way was opened for  succeeding generations of artists to  pour out their souls in creations of  unforgetable beauty, striving to express nobly the knowledge, hopes and  fears of the people of their day. Devout monks like Fra Bartolomeo and  Fra Angelico glorified their cells, dim  places of prayer and fasting, with  visions of radiant, happy motherhood; under their brush the gray  walls of the convent bloomed into  forms of eternal and ineffable beauty.  Madonna art maintained its spiritual  character.till the 15th century, when  the traditional features of Mary gave  place to portraits  of living persons.  The handsome wives of Rubens and  Andrea del Sarto constantly appear  in their pictures, while Van Dyke and  others gave to the pure and gentle  virgin the features of their mistresses!  Why did  the great painters leave  off paint1 and goddesses and  begin to paint the virgin? The artist is always the exponent of the worship of a people, so when we see thum  choose the Madonna as chief theme,  we infer she was deepest in affection  and reverence of the people of their  day. We see in this a Wonderful  truth, a change in the ideals of men;  so from worshipping the qualities of  physical strength, they came to find  in the womanly elements of character  the true standard of perfection.  Had not men's standards changed,  woman would today be where she was  two thousand years ago; or where she I  now is in those countries where there !  are no pictures of the Madonna.  (      In   course  of  time.all  nobility  as-i  d to feminine character in story ,  and  myth   was centered  in  this gra- j  CiOUfi mother of our Lord. The radiant!  chivalry  of  the  Crusades  cast  much  tenderness   and   sanctity   about   her  and   the  title   Madonna  "Our   Lady"  came into general use.  Every kind of devotion, every pic-  turesqueness of homage crowned her i  as "our lady" whose colors all were  proud to wear, the lady of all hearts.  Poets chanted her praises, Dante lent  his powerful influence to perpetuate  her lent his powerful influence to  perpetuate her , glory. Listen to his  I sublime   ode:  I "Oh virgin mother,  daughter of thy  Son,  Here thou to us of charity and love  Art as the noonday torch; and art beneath  To   mortal   men,    of   hope   a  living  spring  Whatso'er  may   be  Of excellence in creature, pity mild,  Relenting mercy, large munificence  Are all combined in thee."  Is there not some reason for these  , honors paid by all classes of men in  ! all ages to the virgin? May it not be  j beca'use the world has always desired  I race-healing through the woman and  j mother?  Mary, the mother of Jesus, symbolized this hope; she is an expression of those deeper unconscious impulses that well up out of the massed  | heart of humanity. We women of  the 20th century can gain much from  I the study of the gracious moral  I beauty, material love, gentleness, and  purity impersonated by the Madonna.	88276728 Bytes	4976	5912	124933646	RGB	8	600	asm04000001520023001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1405	1405	1406.jp2	/asm0400/image/1406.jp2

As we study our Browning  | let us not forger this matchless verse*  j in her honor:  i  I "Mother!   whose virgin bosom as un-  crost  With the least shade of thought to j  sin   allied;  Woman!   Above   all  woman   glorified;  Our tainted   nature's  solitary  boast; j  All  that  was   was   mixed   and   reconciled  in  thee  Of mother love, with maiden  purity,  , Of high with low—  i Purer   than   foam   on   central   ocean  . tost.  Thy image falls to earth!"  May these  pictures  teach  us new  lessons of reverence for the mysterious sanctity of motherhood, help us  to   realize   that   motherhood   means  something to God. "Through millions  | of ages &od  wrought with star-dust j  and earth-dust, fire, wind and water, I  | ever ascending in type till in the full-  ness of time the first human mother  I held her child in her arms and God  | rested  from  His  labors.   Madonna—  ! Mother—may   we   learn   from   thee  ! that motherhood is partnership with  j God. "What purity, what self-control,  j what love, what wisdom, should be-  [ long to her who helps God fashion an  immortal soul!"  When  Mary  poured  forth that wonderful Magnificat "My  soul doth magnify the Lord;  behold  from henceforth all generations shall  call me blessed," little did she dream  how  literally  that  prediction  should  be   fulfilled.   Twenty   centuries   have  passed, yet still  her  praise is sung*  still is she called  "blessed."  Then let us give out girls pictures  of the Madonna.  They belong to no  j religious   creed,   they   exist   for   all j  j time, bid them gaze on her fair, se- |  Irene face and  learn of her all  that;  lis exquisitely pure and virginal. Then ;  .   ! will   they,   too,   arise   and   call   her i  j "blessed." Tell them that as the glory '  | around   her   brow   comes   from   her  jmotherhood  so a  possible  halo  may  'encircle  their  brows,  the     halo     of  motherhood.  | For motherhood is divine, "When  i God maae for his son the cradle of  la woman's body, he put on it the  jseal of its divinity." Teach them  j that this heritage is that of every  | girl, her kingdom prepared for her  i before the  foundation of the  world.  They   may   not     be   the     "Queen   of  ; Heaven,"  but  each   may become  the  ; "Queen   of   Home."  So   as  they   look  | on. their  Madonna  may  they   say,   "I  j will   keep   my  body  sweet  and   clean I  and pure. I will cultivate her tender,  :   heroic,   self-sacrificing,  love-lore.   1  will be noble, gentle, kind and true."  | So may they reach the noble ends for  which   they   were   designed   so    may  | they each  become  in  truth a  virgin  mother.  From the myriad pictures of the  Madonna a lovely host as uncountable as the stars," I have selected a  few to illustrate this paper. 1 call  them my rosary of Mary—a rosary,  each bead an artist's prayer, the expression of the devotion of his soul.  So along the thread of .historic sequence shall be strung the beads of  our rosary of artists whose creations  are here presented.  Shelley was inspired by Murillo's  "Immaculate Conception" to pour out  his adoration as follows:  "Seraph of heaven!  too gentle to be  human—  Veiling beneath that radiant form of  woman  All that is insupportable in thee,  of  light  and   love   and   immortality!  SeeVhere she stands, a mortal shape  endued  With   love,   and  life,   and   light   and  deity!"  Modern Madonna painting is not  of specisfl interest since it does not  represent the chief interest of the  people.  "My babe lies within my arms, and |  singing soft and low,  My   thoughts   are   dwelling   on   that  night when long and long ago,  A mother opened wide her arms and  j on her tender breast  | With mother-love and reverence, laid  her Holy Babe to rest,  j Could   sue   have   felt   a   thrill   more  keen, a love more deeply true  I Under the touch of holy hands than  I now feel for you?

Stewart,  Dec* 14, 1912  11 has been said that a good picture on the wall is a  silent teacher, teaching all the time, and we are beginning  t o realize this more and more for the movement for placing  g ood art examples on the walls of our public schools is rapld-  ly growing  The first consideration influencing the choice of pictures  f or the school? oom is that of art culture; in choosing pictures  we must think of their enduring, artistic qualities. Ghly the  b est should be given a lasting place on the walls.  To the little child who comes, sensitive and shy, from the  h ome circle into the larger community of the schoolroom, what  more gracious welcome could await him than the gentle, loving  p resence of one of the Madonnas, assuring him as it does, of  love and care and sympathy, in his school home not less than in  t he familiar family life ?  For surely no teacher under that  b enign influence can be impatient or harsh with the little ones  who trust her so confidingly.  And what of the street urchin whose only idea of home is  a place for eating and sleeping, and with whom the thought of  "Mjther" is too often associated with harsh tones and Impatient  b lows ?  What can a picture of the Madonna mean to him ? May  i t not teach him that, after all, the world is full of love;  that he himself, neglected little waif, though he seem, is en-  t itled to his share of it ?  One great purpose of picture study is that of opening the  eyes to beauty all around, which an artistfs trained eye per-  c eives while it is missed by others.  We must bring to pictures, as to literature, our best ef-  f ort at interpretation, if they are to yield up to us their  d eepest meaning.  "Though we travel the world over to find the  beautiful, we must carry it with us or we find it not ",  P icture study is an essential part of a public school  c ourse in elementary art study.  While children should be giv-  e n abundant opportunity for original expression, they need also  t o form rigjtxt ideals of art, Just as they need to cultivate  good taste in literature.	87405344 Bytes	4920	5920	2013078282	RGB	8	600	asm04000001520025001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1407	1407	1408.jp2	/asm0400/image/1408.jp2

All  e arnest, honest observation of good pictures brings to the  8 tudent of drawing larger conceptions of the possibilities of  art, new insight into strong and beautiful ways of working and  d eepened incentives to personal endeavor.  On the other hand,  e ven the most elementary attempts at art expression on his own  p art increase his power to understand and appreciate the work  o f masters.  The highest purpose of picture study in public  s chools is thus many sided:  it helps open a child's eyes to  t he beauty in the world around him, it helps bring him into in-  spirlng communion with master minds in all the ages, and it  helps bring out the best of his own creative powers.

In a delightful informal talk they  ' touched upon many phases of life,  explained much that seems strange to  foreigners and refuted some false  statements that have gained currency.  The oft-repeated assertion that  Chinese are employed as cashiers in  Japanese banks is erroneous. It has  been accepted by tourists who go,  naturally, to the English banks where  they are always served by a Chinaman. In matters involving the handling of money the Japanese are honest. If, however, they find they are  going to lose on a contract, they find  abundant reason for breaking it.  A curious fact in regard to ca^te  was brought out. The leather-tanners  rank so low that they are not even  included in the census. Next above  them are the beggars. Then the merchants, the coolies, the business men  and the official class. As Occidental  itfeas and customs are creeping in,  £he rank of the merchant is gradually rising.  Pride of race is a marked attribute, the Japanese considering themselves far superior to any other race.  They are glaa to get the money which  the foreigners bring into Japan,  though they secretly despise them.  They rarely invite any foreigners to  their homes, entertaining them in  teahouses, if at all.  The Japanese are quick to adopt  any western ideas of value and at  the same time are slow to abandon  their traditions. Though they have  embodied the most modern ideas in  the construction of their men-of-war,  they christen all of them with names  ending in maru. Years of research  by philological scholars has failed to  discover the meaning of this custom.  The—Japanese cannot explain this—  they do it because they always have  done it.  The marriages are conducted entirely through a , marriage broker.  T,he   ceremony   is   extremely   simple.  The contracting parties, their families and the broker constitute the  wedding party. Seated on the floor,  the bride touches a cup of saki to  her lips and passes it to the groom.  This is repeated nine times and the  ceremony is complete. The marriage  is recorded at the registrar's office.  Divorce is far easier in Japan than  America. If either husband or wife  becomes dissatisfied, he packs up his  belongings and leaves. He notifies the  registrar who crosses the names off  his book and hey for the marriage  broker again.  Japan is almost a paradise for  children. They are treated with the  utmost gentleness. "Don't" is not  the household word as in this country. The houses are furnished so simply that there is almost nothing that  could be harmed by them.  The floors are covered by delicate  rice-mats,   always   made   three   feet  by six, on a framework which raises  them about four inches. Heels would  | puncture these mats and so they are  'always left at the door. There is no  i other  furniture but a kakemono, or  ! painted scroll, on the wall, and a vase  | with  a  single  flower.     The  bedding  | consists  merely  of a   wooden  pillow  j and a down quilt which are put away  j in closets during the day.  The wooden pillow is placed under  : the neck and is used to protect the  ! elaborate hair-dressing which is kept  I intact for several days. Even the servants employ a hair-dresser.  The Japanese are a joyous, pleasure-loving race.    During the season,  the   cherry-blossom   festival   is   celebrated by everybody, old and young  Dressed in their best, they go forth  | to  enjoy the beauty of the flowers.  I Little booths are erected  under the  | trees  were refreshments are  served.  '. The    cherry-blossoms are    pink and  never mature.  Kite-flying contests are a popular  j diversion. Each kite has the upper  ■ end of the string coated with pow-  I dered glass. Each tries, to cross his  1 opponent's string and cut it by sawing it across.  The rapid fire of questions asked  by the members and guests testified  to their interest in the subject.	83391556 Bytes	4752	5848	3626431671	RGB	8	600	asm04000001520028001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1410	1410	1411.jp2	/asm0400/image/1411.jp2

Aj  dazzling Christmas tree, claiming the |  attention of all, made further decor- i  ations unnecessary.  Mrs.   Gifford   who   had   charge   of  the music,  made  a charming  introduction tcT the program by telling of  the good old English customs of un-  I iversal singing at all special seasons.  To   begin  the program    everyone  I joined  in  singing the beautiful  and  ! familiar   old   carol:      "Holy     Night,  | Peaceful Night." After that the older  I school  boys, accompanied by the pi-  I ano, violin and a merry little trian-  | gle,   sang  a  pretty  Christmas  song.  Miss  Schneider's   kindergarten  class  in  the  sweetest  of  manners  and  of  voices   gave   a   wee  song  about   the  "Wonderful  Tree."  Mrs. DeGarmo sang a lovely little  selection  fron an  old  English  song.  A Christmas stocking of candy and  a pretty little gift from the Housekeepers'   Club   were   given   to   each  child, and refreshments of lemonade  cake  and  candy were  served to all.  The   children   gave   an   enthusiastic  three cheers for the club and so another Christmas meeting was passed.  On next Thursday Mrs. Fredericks  of Miami, president of the tSate Federation of Woman's Clubs, will talk  to   the   Housekeepers'   Club   on   the  j work  of the  federation.	83419384 Bytes	4760	5840	994102625	RGB	8	600	asm04000001520030001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1412	1412	1413.jp2	/asm0400/image/1413.jp2

WORK  BY *  * A CLUB PRESIDENT *  * +  "If you want something well done,  why—do it yourself." This is a  motto that many women's club have  adopted for their working principle  and accounts of their accomplishments are  filled with  interest.  The Housekeper's Club at Cocoa-  nut Grove, as the name suggests, is  pledged to do all it can to better  civic conditions as well as to give inspiration for housewives, who have  been assembling at the pretty club  house at the Grove for many years,  to discuss art and literature and  everything else that sends one back  to housekeeping with a better courage for its duties.  The club has always felt great  pride in the good appearance of the  village and has felt that in some way  the presence of unsightly advertising posters, scattered papers or other  debris was a reflection upon the organization and furthermore, the club  members have seen to it that continual war is waged against all violators of sanitary laws.  The begining of the new year,  however, was started in a vigorous  way, that the Cocoanut \rrove people  are going to remember with a "lived-  up-to-resolution to never let it be  made necessary again."  Miss Flora McFarrane, the cultured and delightful president of  the Housekeepers club, carrying a  rake, started out early Monday morning with a man and a large wagon,  and would you believe it at sunset,  had seen five wagon loads of old  paper and rubbish safely buried far  from the village!  It was not that the rubbish was  conspicuous", but that the president of'  the Housekeeper's Club does things  thoroughly and her efforts were approved of in the merriest sort of  way by the citizens of the Grove who  like the Housekeepers, one and  all.  STREET CLEANING  BY HOUSE-KEEPERS  Al COCOANUT GROVE  Miss McFarlane, president of the  Housekeepers Club, spent Monday afternoon superintending the cleaning  of the village streets. She conscientiously followed the man with the  cart, and saw that papers, tin cans  and trash was cleared up. When the  president of a big club like that of  the Housekeepers Club of Cocoanut  Grove can do such work, surely the  residents will help keep the highways  clean. A very little care oh the part  of all would help. All honor and  thanks are due the Housekeepers'  Club president.	83136704 Bytes	4744	5840	1890216261	RGB	8	600	asm04000001520035001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1417	1417	1418.jp2	/asm0400/image/1418.jp2

Before the program began there was a report in civic improvement—a movement in which the  club is at present interesting itself.  Surely it is a good work for any club  to take up, and one which has in  many places proved a highly efficient means of beautifying a town.  The president of the club, Miss Mc-  Farland, had set the example for the  | whole town on last Tuesday by per-  i sonally   superintending   a   thorough  I cleaning up of the club house grounds  j and by having trash cans placed  at  | convenient places about    the    town.  Her example made an eloquent appeal  to all the school children at the meeting who  were admonished to  "help  the Housekeepers Club    help Cocoa-  nut Grove clean and beautiful."  Miss McFarland and Mrs. Gifford  further cited instances in which the  aid of children had been invaluable  in civic improvement. There is every  reason to hope for good results from  this new phase of club work.  Mrs. Clinkenbeard had charge of  the program for the afternoon, her  subject was story-telling. She read  a very interesting paper in which she  dealt with the value of story telling  as an art and its great revival in  schools, playgrounds, and libraries.  A room# furnished with a view to artistic pleasure to the child, where a  professional story-teller entertains  children by her charming stories has  become an important addition to the  well equipped library.  There children of all ages make  enthusiastic and fascinating listeners. To the young child nursery stor  ies and nature stories are of vast interest. As he grows older, fairy stories, myths taught by ancient peoples,  legends of heroes and saints, such as  the earliest literature of our modern  languages are rich in, and finally biographical sketches carefully selected  from history, are an invaluable  source of development and stimulant  of good literary taste. To quote from  the paper itself, "Besides guiding  his reading, a carefully prepared story well told, encircles a child's imagination, stocks his mind with poetic  imagery and literary allusions, develops his powers of concentration  helps in the unfolding of his ideas of  right and wrong and develops his  sympathetic feelings—all of which  has a powerful influence on character  —thus the story hour properly utilized becomes an educational force as  well as a literary guide."  As it was childrens' day at the club  Mrs. Clinkenbeard devoted the remainder of the hour to entertaining  the school children. She read a few  short stories; there was a most entertaining story of "Buzzie the Bee,"  told by Miss Schneider, the story of  Proserpina by Miss Waller, and a  cunning little story by Harry Cum-  ington, one of th.e kindergarten children; Mrs. Wald8n sang a child song;  and the school, led by Miss Baker,  sang a very pretty song.  After that cake and cookies were  served the children and tea to tne  "grownups". Altogether it was a most  enjoyable nreeting to all present. The  children are anxiously awaiting another such delightful  afternoon.  Announcements of next week's program will be made later.	83698200 Bytes	4776	5840	3803670325	RGB	8	600	asm04000001520037001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1419	1419	1420.jp2	/asm0400/image/1420.jp2

Miss Lester had charge  of  the  program  for  the  afternoon  With very few preliminaries Mrs.  Fredericks of Miami, president of  the State Federation of Florida began the program with a talk on the  work of the Federation. She gave  a brief historic sketch of the Federation, and then told of the departments into which the work was  divided. They are: Art, education,  health, social conditions, social service reform, civic   and legislative.  Different federations have accomplished a great work along these  various lines. This year more than  ever before a great eflort is being  made by the Florida Federation  through the agencies of these departments and their co-operative  work to make the work of Florida  systematic, definite and practical.  Also the president aims at a meet-1  ing of the federation next year ?.t  which the representatives present j  shall know the purpose of these departments. Pamphlets relating to  some of the most important matters  with which tlje federation deals have  been distributed to the clubs  throughout the state. •  After Mrs. Frederick's interesting  talk Miss Lester read extracts from  President Taft's appeal to club women for co-operation in the matter of  the arbitrative treaties now pending.  She explained briefly the present  agitation of the subject and told ot  the work being done by the World  Peace Foundation.  Mrs. Williams brought before the  members of the club the matter of  the appointment of an expert to look  after the interests of the Seminole  Indians of Florida which certainly  demands speedy attention.  The   crhb   adjourned   and   refresh-!  ments were served.	84747636 Bytes	4816	5864	2464878922	RGB	8	600	asm04000001520041001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1423	1423	1424.jp2	/asm0400/image/1424.jp2

At the entrance  two pages !n Japanese costume welcomed the guests with the Oriental  saluatation "May your ancestors be  blessed." The doorway was outlined  in yellow with bamboo decorations.  The guests assembled on the porches  until the hall was opened.  The stage was a perfect Japanese  scene. Across the front luxuriant  wisteria blossoms hung overhead.  Within the wings were peach trees  in full bloom. In the rear was a  Japanese frieze, on the wings various  panels and other Japanese decorations. Amidst this typically Japanese setting whe costumed figures stood  out 1 ke silhouettes. Four kneeling  girls served the tea, and as a cen-  terpkxe the gorgeously arrayed representative of the Empress Dowager  sat graciously receiving the guests. I  Madam Ito Togo was her name and j  she handed each of the guests one of j  her q laint cards.  Tables scattered about the hall j  were dressed with blue Japanese run- |  ners and vases.  Alter an informal social time j  there was a most enjoyable program j  Mrs. Eugene Romfh gave a de-'  lightLiil rendition of Denza's "Sing  On," and was enthusiastically encored. Doris DeGarmo, the youngest  member of the club danced most be-  witclTingly. Mrs. DeGarmo sang a  beautiful lit r"e Japanese love song.  At  the  request  of  Mrs.   Williams,  actiig president, Miss Cobb and Mrs.  Burbank  explained  to those  present  the work of the nurse employed  by  the   Woman's   Relief   association   of  Miami.  So  well  did they  succeed  in  convincing  trie   women   of   Cocoanut  Grovo  and   iheir   many   guests   from  Miami of the merit of this work that  i a very liberal contribution was made  after refreshments had been served.  ;     Tiie subject announced in the Year  | Book for Feo. 1 has been postponed  [until a later date. The club is most  | fortunate in having secured the promise   rf   an   address   from   Dr.   Hiram  Byrd,  of  the  state  board  of  health  Who will be in Miami on that date.  The Housekeepers are elated at their  good luck and extend a hearty invitation to all.  A "TRIP TO JAPAN" AT  HOUSEKEEPERS' CLUB.  On Thursday afternoon the Housekeepers' Club of Cocoanut Grove gave  a very pretty affair in their roomy  and attractive club house. As the  guests arrived they were met by the  members of a reception comfmittee,  who spared no pains in giving a hearty welcome, and were sure every one  knew everybody before they were allowed to stroll in the beautifully decorated room. • i  Upon entering, one seemed to have  stepped over the threshold into another country,—Japan, with its cherry blossoms, bamboo and flowers of  beautiful colorings,—so perfectly was  all arranged. Upon the stage purple  wistaria turned in, out and all about;  bamboo and cherrv blossbms with elegant screens, Japanese pitchers, parasols, all formed a perfect background  for the Madame Ito Togo (Mrs. H. C.  Roome) who received in an elegant  Japanese gown. With a salute, borrowed from Japan, she presented to  each guest, her card. This, too,  must have come across the seas to  show the many beautiful glimpses of  that country, for each was a tiny but  perfect picture.  Four Japanese ladies all gowned  most attractively in silk kimonas, took  no small part in forming a picture,  while kneeling on cushions, with their  tea trays before them. When all had  been received by the Empress—the  meeting was called to order bv Mrs.  Williams, vice-president, who stated  its object, to secure funds for the  Woman's Relief Association of Miami.  She asked Miss Kolb, its president,  to inform the ladies of the work of  this association, which Miss Kolk did,  briefly telling of its historv, membership, etc, leading to the topic of the  district nurse, (whom the society sud-  ports), when Mrs. Burbank kindly  gave all information possible upon  this new work, and answered most  concisely many questions asked by  the ladies.  The best was still to come; Mrs.  DeGarmo sweetly sang a Chinese Tea  Song. A tiny little miss danced most  gracefully, and Mrs. Eugene Romfh  sang The Japanese Love Song so  beautifully. She responded to an encore asking her to sing it again. Mrs.  Romfh was in excellent voice, and  with Mrs. H. Pierre Brahning, as accompanist, it was delightful.  The four Japanese ladies, helped by  club members, served tea and cakes  which was enjoyed b^ all.  Then the guests did their part in  giving a free will offering to support  the district nurse. Miss Kolb reported  over thirty  dollars  collected,  and  (Continued from Page 4.)  a hearty "thank ypu" in the name of  the Woman's Relief Association.  Each person felt' grateful for the  generosity and hospitality of the  Housekeepers' Club. Many automobiles carried ladies from Miami who  enjoyed the beautiful ride to Japan,  returning while the sun was setting,  thus  ending a perfect afternoon.	84605864 Bytes	4808	5864	899332969	RGB	8	600	asm04000001520046001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1428	1428	1429.jp2	/asm0400/image/1429.jp2

The lecture was interesting and very instructive, yet simply put and easily comprehensible.  Dr. Byrd told, omitting technicalities, just how and to what extent the  mosquito and fly are enemies to public health. He explained, also, much  about the misrepresented and misunderstood germ.  In his introductory talk Dr. Byrd  paid us the compliment of referring)  to Cocoanut Grove as his ideal of a  place in which to live and rest after j  one retires from active business—An  ideal place for a home.  Another event gratifying item in I  -lis speech was his statement of the  fact that in examining the blood of  school children all over the state for  indications of latent malaria, the  State Board of Health found no indications of malaria in Cocoanut  j Grove.  After the lecture tea and cake were  served and a social half hour was  enjoyed.  .j. *.;.^ •£.•£••!. .{«*******.£•  «{• •$•  * TALKED  ON MEDICAL *  * INSPECTION FOR SCHOOLS *  * *  .{..g.**************  Dr. Hiram Byrd of Jacksonville,  met with a number of the ladies of  the School Improvement Association  Of Miami on Saturday afternoon at  the hone of Mrs. John Sewell, on  Thirteenth street, and gave them a  short taJk on the advisibility of hav-|  ing medical inspection in the schools.!  Dr. Byrd is anxious to establish a  course of medical instruction in the  state Normal schools, and have the  teachers generally take a course of  medical lectures, in order to establish better health conditions among  the children of the public schools.  It is Dr. Byrd's theory that if the  teachers knew more about these  things, had taken a course of lectures and prepared themselves for  the work, they could make out a card  and sent it to the parent of a child  needing treatment, requesting the  parents to take the child to their  family physician.  Dr. Byrd also gave a brief outline  of a talk which he himself gives in  the scnool room to the children on  the subject of "germs," and stated  that it was wonderful how even the  younger children grasped and became interested it. He also said that  tor the sum of 25 cents or even less  every teacher could prepare them-;  selves to give this same talk, and  that in his opinion great good would |  result from enlightening the children  on this subject.  mm  1H ■  1	84842688 Bytes	4888	5784	1906368109	RGB	8	600	asm04000001520048001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1430	1430	1431.jp2	/asm0400/image/1431.jp2

Mis3 Eleanor Percy, of Miami,  read an excellent paper on this subject, which she illustrated with delightful musical selections especially  suited to training school children.  Miss Schneider's Kindergarten  class sang several short but charming  kindergarten songs. The children  of Cocoanut Grove sang very prettily  and Miss Percy thoroughly approved  of their songs and complimented their  training.  j At the close of the paper Miss Per-  jcy sang several additional exquisite  j selections as an especial favor. These  I were greatly appreciated and enjoyed  I by those present.  After that tea and cake were serv-  led and the ladies discussed various  j topics over their tea cups.  Miss Percy's paper was of such  I vital interest and contains so many  ! valuable suggestions that it is given  fin full:  Music in the School.  The question so much discussed as  to whether the American people is to  become a musical people would naturally be followed by a further question, viz: "How shall the Americans  become a musical people?"  Music was a lost art among the  early settlers, all feelings inspired by  early folk songs of their native lands  being changed to new scenes, new  skies, new conditions. When America  was first settled the conditions were  anything but favorable for the fine  arts, and music was especially cried  down.  A nation has to be on a good physical plane before art is developed.  Now America has every resource  required for artistic development, rich  in all natural products, free institutions for mental, moral and social  development; pride in home, country  and family, and a keen appreciation  of all that is beautiful.  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ But in order  to bring these resources into operation, through music, the child must  be taught to sing, and this must be'  done through the public school. Note  the example of Germany and Italy  for the influence of music on a nation.  Lowell Mason was the first to begin  such work in this country- He opened  | a school of music for teachers and  I about 1836 sight singing was started  in some of the schools of the country.  A quotation from a musical magazine  'is as follows:  "The introduction of vocal music in  '. public schools, when well conducted,  exerts a powerful influence toward  rendering both the taste and know-!  ledge of music more general and  more popular. It will teach people  that it is not absolutely necessary to  have a fine voice in order to take part  in a chorus. They will learn that almost everyone, by being taught in  early life, can acquire enough skill  and flexibility to enable him not only  to derive pleasure himself from music, but to give it to others. They  will also find that it requires something besides a beautiful voice to  make a successful performance; a  beautiful voice is a dead instrument  unless vivified by tone and feeling  and brought under command in order  to sing with feeling and expression."  Good reading is mainly dependent  upon correct modulation and articulation. Modulation refers to tone and  to vowel sounds, articulation refers  to pronunciation of consonant sounds,  therefore dynamics or that part of  vocal music which is concerned wUh  the force of tone delivery has an excellent influence on correct speech.  It smooths out all tendencies toward  a shrill, tight speaking voice and one  authority claims that all voices, great  or small, bass or shrill, weak or soft  may be helped and brought to a good  point by learning to sing. It also tends  to give a natural and easy method of  breathing, which causes a better circulation of the blood and is restful  and refreshing at the same time. Thus  a class, tired from study, may, after  fifteen minutes of song, return to  study very much Invigorated.  j fr •  Music in the school is not designed j  to train artists or singers as some in- j  fer, but it does help in understanding!  and appreciating the work of others  and becomes a most valuable physical, mental and spiritual exercise 1n  the school curriculum and has a refining influence on speech.  If  a  nation  is  ever  to become a  musical one and have its fplk-songs,  we must begin with the little ones.  The first step i3 to create an appreciation of sound and make the child  realize that music is one way of expressing the feelings. The teacher  must be full of imagination herself,  making the children see and hear  things as she does.  The susceptibility of the child will  depend largely on previous home influence, for the first impressions of  sound and speech are from imitation.  A child learns its language and games  from listening and watching, so we  begin with songs, short simple ones,  with words that picture some familiar  idea to the child's mind, such as wind  blowing, birds singing/ or the story  of a bird's nest, grandma knitting, a  train puffing, songs of labor, of flowers, or nature. These they learn  from imitation. It is best to tell the  story of the song then the teacher  sings it over several times before the  children begin. Songs should be selected with a view to beauty of melody, with a well marked rhythm, of  easy range and not down on the low  notes. A child's voice is naturally  pitched high, and is soft and sweet  and when not forced for loud tones  is flute-like in quality. It is very essential for the teacher or leader, if  possible, to adapt her own voice to  the quality or timbre of a little child  for as a child hears, so he imitates.  Heavy draggy tones interfere with  free action or animation. To attempt  to acquire volume before the pupil is  ready for it physically or mentally  is a great mistake.  I hope the work in music theory  and naturalness will help the teacher in developing the beauty of voice  in our future generations.	83845644 Bytes	4751	5881	3806952081	RGB	8	600	asm04000001520050001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1432	1432	1433.jp2	/asm0400/image/1433.jp2

A child's breath control is slight and, as it takes less  breath to make a high note than a  low one, this seems to me a simple  explanation of the high pitch of a  child's voice which gradually lowers  as the child grows older. A child  should never be called on to sing long  phrases.  Bird, beast, flowers and shells, all  are wonders to a child's mind; they  thrill him with the feeling of a new  discovery all his' own. The child  should not only see and play w!th  them but sing about them, as the  song fixes them in hfs thoughts.  Music and song with action develops a sense of rhythm and also develops his physical nature and a har-  jmonious action, ease and grace of carriage and a keen sense of observation.  A child in learning to sing with a  soft, musical quality of tone, with animation and Interest, learns to discriminate between a musical and a  harsh tone, recognizes rhythm, and  can express his own mood as though  \ it was a spontaneous effort.  The song as such should be the bee-inning and  end  of musical  expression in the school—pure tqne never  I being lost sight of even in patriotic  songs which some are apt to forget in  i their over enthusiasm to make a joy-  ! ful   noise.   After   several   months   of  j imitation song  singing,  a little  elementary workmay be taken up by  means of chajus, but if these are not  available we always have the blackboard. The scale is first sung downward, then up, on do, re, mi, fa, or on  numbers. Then the scale may be divided in steps,  then skip* the steps.  Then the staff may be explained, the  names and different kinds of notes,  then time, signature and scale name.  Every new point to be exemplified  by  a  practical  explanation  and   the  pupil is stimulated to show or draw  characters as he understands them.  Singing from notes, requires great  concentration of mind, quickness of  vision, etc. When carried out, a sixth  grade pupil should sing an easy song  or duet atsight.  In this work a child gets quite a  ' repertory    of good songs from    the  » classics, and patriotic and folk songs.  There have been  some wonderful  results obtained with large choruses  of children, especially when you hav  the   cooperation   of   the   whole—o*  teachers and family.  In a number of schools artists are  engaged to sing for the pupils, also  a number of amateurs, thus giving  them the benefit of all that is good.  In Cleveland I hear they have installed the player-piano. Some schools  have their own orchestras and glee  clubs, the latter being common in  high schools. When a recital is given  or a biography of some composer, all  influences are brought to bear to  make music a part of the life of the  people.  In America people need music in  daily life as a relaxation from the  terrible strain under which most of  us live. Music turns the mind into  other channels, and stimulates rather than excites.  ! In the upper grades part singing  is usually begun with a "round"—  one familiar to all, such as "Three  I Blind Mice," or it^an be sung simply  ! with the scale in Thirds. The subject  is almost an inexhaustible one.  I have wished especially to give  you the elementary work with a few  illustrations. For pure imitation  there are the songs of Otto Miessner.  of Indiana. They are new, just published last year, and like Jessie Gay-  nor he believes in having a rich harmonious accompaniment, as a child  gains more of rhythmic expression or  perceives rhythm, before it does mel-  jody, and the cultivation of this perception is essential to any musical ed-  j ucation. Eleanor Smith's primer is  • used almost throughout the middle  iwest. She is connected with the Chicago schools.	85233620 Bytes	4824	5888	2763498029	RGB	8	600	asm04000001520052001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1434	1434	1435.jp2	/asm0400/image/1435.jp2

It comprised a cantata, "The Fairies of the Seasons" as the "piece  de resistance"—given by nearly forty children of different grades.  This was quite an elaborate and  ambitious performance; the singing  was remarkable for good tone and  the drill was carried out with precision and grace; the whole fairy  troupe was a very pretty spectacle  —as it is to be repeated* a week  hence, further description is unnecessary at this time.  Other   numbers   on   the     program  were:     "International Songs," Swedish,  German,  anl Spanish verses be-  j ing  sung in  native tongue by three  i little  girls,  followed  by  "America,"  i and "Dixie" by all the scholars.  "Our Flag," a riddle and 'Flag  i Song" were given by the primary  ! grades.  On the evening of February  22d,  I at 7:30 the Fairies and their Queen  | will   appear  again,   and     the     High  School   class  will  give  a, play  entitled, "Knaves and Fools."  The admission will be twenty-five  cents, the receipts to be for the benefit of a school organ fund.  The earnest efforts, so well rewarded, of Mr. and Mrs. Asbury and  Miss Baker and the entire school,  are appreciated by every housekeeper and every parent in the community. There is a fine "esprit de  corps" being cultivated, which gives  us all great hopes of the future.  There will be no Housekeepers'  Program on the afternoon of the  22nd. The Club Bazaar will take  place Thursday, February 29th.  * PLEASANT ENTERTAINMENT  *  AT COCOANUT GROVE. *  * *  * **********     $  A very successful entertainment  was provided by the Cocoanut Grove  | school at the Housekeepers' Club on  last  Thursday.  It was offered to the program committee to fill a gap and the results  gave pleasure to all.  A cantata called "The Fairies of the  Seasons" was sung. The drill with  wands and graceful atlire and the  singing were most commendable.  Three little girls sang "International Songs"—verses in Swedish, German and Spanish and followed by  American tunes sung by all.

According to announcement, the  pupils of the Cocoanut Grove school  presented on the evening of the  22ntf, the Cantata and Drill, "The  ^Fairies 01 the Seasons,'* and a play  entitled, "Knaves and Fools."  The auditorium of the Housekeepers' - Club was filled tto ^overflowing,  even the spacious porch was crowded for lack of space!inside. It was  remarked that no such crowd ever  gathered at the club;house before.  It seems that the** people are appreciative of the fa!ct that an excellent school is being conducted in  the community and khey responded  to the enthusiastic-efforts . of the  children. The music of the cantata  is beautiful and was beautifully rendered. The fairies in their gauzy  robes were exceeding graceful and  their rhythmic march through the  intricacies of the complex drill, evidenced careful work, by the teachers, Miss Baker and Mr. Asbury, assisted by Mrs. Asbury, who presided at the piano throughout the cantata.  The comedy, "Knaves and Fools"  was presented by the seven boys  composing the high school class.  The clever acting of, the boys not-  only pleased but most agreeably surprised the audience. There were  many humorous situations in the  play which convulsed the audience  with laughter.  There were some special short  numbers on the program. "International Songs," "Uncle Sam's Jolly  Tars," "Spanish Song," and recitation, "The Fairies." All these were  well received and enthusiastically  applauded. The audience was "full  of good humor."  This entertainment assures the  school of an excellent organ, which  has already been installed. To say  that the citizens of Cocoanut Grove  are enthusiastic about the splendid  entertainment and with reference to  their school is stating the facts very  mildly. Sensible and enthusiastic  co-operation will accomplish wonders.    Special   appreciation   is     due  the Housekeepers' Club, not only for  the use of their building but for their  sympathetic attitude toward the  school.  ,,] If only, now, the. enthusiastic cooperation of the people of the community can be directed toward clearing and preparing the school  grounds, Mr. Matheson offers to  furnish all trees, shrubs, vines, etc,  and have same properly planted.  Tliis is generous-and-most commend-  laJale. Such .an opportunity must  not be neglected!'

Dr. Eberhart is a distinguished  educator and takes a great deal of  interest in the schools wherever he  goes. He was the first County Superintendent of Public Instruction  in Cook County, Illinois, in which  Chicago is situated.  This is not his first visit to Miami,  and his friends here will be delighted to learn of the opportunity given  them to hear his interesting address.  As he was a close friend of Lincoln,  he will doubtless be able to relate  many events in the life of this great  man that have been told.  Housekeepers Club Hears Story  Of Lincoln by Dr. Eberhardt  The Housekeepers Club of Cocoa-  nut Grove listened yesterday to a  most interesting address by Dr. John |  Frederick Eberhardt, A. M., LL. D.J  who spoke of his Personal Reminiscences of Abraham Lincoln, whose  friendship Dr. Eberhardt enjoyed  for a long period of years.  Dr Eberhardt spoke of Mr. Lincoln's physical appearance. "He  was even more tall and ungainly  than is generally conceived by people from accounts and pictures. He  was six feet five and one half inches  in height, as I remember it, and was  so slim he looked more. He nearly  always dressed in black. "When I  knew him#first he was the leading  lawyer in the state of Illinois. He  was so frank and honest and open  that he won everybody who talked  with him. Everybody had confidence  in him. I don't believe there was a  living man who had talked with Lincoln who wouldn't have had faith  in his sincerity and earnestness. In  his profession he was very mild, and  eminently fair, relying entirely upon the facts and the law, seeking  the solution of the difficulty according to what was right and just.  •'When I first met him I went to  hear him in a case before the Supreme Court. Of course I expected to hear a great rousing speech,  but instead he talked as calmly and  quietly as I am talking to you now."

PEACOCK  The funeral of Mrs. J. T. Peacock  occurred yesterday afternoon at one  o'clock at the family home near Cocoanut Grove and was very largely  attended.  "Aunt Martha" had friends and  most loving ones in all parts of the  county and the services yesterday  were markedly indicative of their regard for her.  The address given by Rev. C. Fred  Blackburn was'particularly fitting in  every way. He has known the family for many years and could speak  frdtai experience, of Aunt Martha's  fine character and beautiful life.  The Housekeeper's Club was pres-  •ent, in a body and from their num-  be| six ladies, Mesdames Swanson,  Mills, Archer, Shone, Dearborn and  Miss McFarlane, charter members of  th$ club and loving friends of Mrs.  Peacock, acted as honorary pall-bear-  er|, carrying great armfuls of flowers to place upon her grave.  •The pall-bearers were Messrs. Roy  Swanson, John Frowt J-t. S. Potter,  B.'S. Potter, Joe Prow, and'; R. L.  MRl-s. A quartette ..from".' Cocoanut  Grove- sang several of,Aunt Martha's  favorite - hymns and interment was  made in the Miami, cemetery.  In the account of Mrs. Peacock's  &lt;le/ath, mention was made ' 6f her  large family of fine sons and daughters, but in some manner Mr. Lind-  sey Peacock, who is third to the  youngest, was not mentioned. He  and 8 brothers, two sisters, a brother-in-law, four sisters-in-law, with  some lovely little nieces and nephews make almost a settlement in  themselves and they are all worthy  of the nne mother they .had.  4* 4* 4* 4* 4* 4* 4* 4* *w 'J* 4* 4" 4" 4" 4* 4*  4* 4*  4- IN MEMORY OP A LOVED 4-  4- MEMBER OF THE CLUB 4-  * 4-  4,4*4*4*4*4&gt;4*4°4*4*4a4*4°4*4"4*  - Thursday afternoon the regular  hour of the Housekeepers' Club was  spent in paying loving tribute to  the late Mrs. J.

She was one of the first members  of the Housekeepers' Club, never  shirking, always willing to do all in  her power. Every member went  home feeling she had been benefited  in some way by hearing loving testimonials of her friends and feeling  that they had lost one of the most  loving, devoted and helpful members.	85042760 Bytes	4800	5904	3258700867	RGB	8	600	asm04000001520067001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1449	1449	1450.jp2	/asm0400/image/1450.jp2

Unless one had made a  study of this subject he could hardly  realize or conceive how our beautiful feathered friends swing through  the air at such great heights or go  such great distances as described in  Mrs. Haden's paper.  There was an interesting and general discussion of the care and protection of birds. Mrs. Smith, of Detroit, one of the pleasant winter visitors, gave an interesting little talk  of a Bird preserve in her locality  where the birds are nested, protected, fed and cared for in a most liap-  py way, by Mr. Ford, a lover Of  birds-  Mrs. Kaden, who read the excellent paper, was most becomingly  gowned in a soft, clinging lavender  gown with touches of rare lace, and  she riead in;a charming manner.  Mrs. Justison was taken into the  club for membership on unanimous  vote.  Members rand friends enjoyed the  usual social cup of tea and deUctaxts  cake before dispersing to tneir  homes.  Next Thitrs'day Mrs.. Stewart will  give an exhibition of work done -by;  the children Of* Cocoanut Grove, As  this is the first-exhibit of this kind  tt promises to be most interesting.

From a residential standpoint we  have four distinct grades of birds to  .consider. '  1st. The summer residents:  Those birds which coming to us in  I:the spring rear their young and af-  'ter shifting about somewhat in late  ,summer retreat more or less southward in winter.  2nd. Residents. Birds that are  with us all the year. We have many  here.  3rd.    Winter residents.  4th. Migrants: Birds with us on-  lya few weeks in spring, en route  from the south to their northern  breeding points and also visible for  a similar period in the autumn as  they return*  The two movements in bird-life in  spring and fall are known as the  great migrations—some birds being  plentiful in spring and rare in the  autumn and vice versa as the path  chosen for the upward and downward  trip may not be the same.  The problem of the Origin and  cause of th- migration of birds has  long been considered as unfathomable mystery, but late investigations  have furnished abundant data on the  when and where of migration and  solved many of its puzzles.  The Bureau of Biologic Survey of  the U. S. Department of Agriculture  has collected much information on  the migration of North American  birds and aviators, especially in Germany, have made special study of the  flights of birds in their efforts to  master the science of flying and have  added some very interesting points  to the data already gathered.  When we realize that the first reliable notes on the migration of  birds in the U. S. were made about  a hundred years ago, it seems quite  wonderful. So far as I have been  able to look into the subject, very  little was known or written on the  subject, previous to that time. I visited the Congressional library on  purpose to study this subject and all  I could find was either in recent magazines or else reports from the Department. Observers in different  parts of the country put their notes  together and come to an understanding about them.  Without entering into a discussion  of the causes which long ago started  birds on their periodical change of  habitations, we shall not be far out  of the way in considering their present migrations the result of inherited  experience. The first migrations  were doubtless very limited in ex^  tent and probably were intelligent  movements which through repetition  became habitual and the habit was  transmitted from parent to offspring  until it has become, as we.see it now,  the governing impulse of the bird?s  life. It is undoubtedly true that  love of the nesting ground which is  to them their home, is the foundation of the desire for migration, and  year after year, they find their way,  thousands Of miles back to the same  box or tree, by the exercise of memory,, not always the memory of the  individual but the memory inherited  from numberless preceding generations which have passed and repassed  : over the same route. In the study  I of the yearly cycle of migrations,  1 there are two movements for which  i we must seek the cause: the restless  1 pushing forward northward in  spite of the cold, rain, sleet and  snow and, the southward journey in  the fall. The northward journey is  undoubtedly caused by the desire to  go home—an overpowering desire to  be once more among the familiar  scenes of the previous summer. The  return movement is obviously the  result of two causes—-the approach  Of winter and the failure of the food  supply. Of these two, the latter is  by far the more powerful since it is  well known that single individuals of  species which retire for the south, often remain behind, and, favored by  an abundance of food, withstand the  most severe weather. I think that  most people who notice birds will  remember individual birds of several  species that have remained all the  year in their northern homes—a few  red-birds, a few robins, cat-birds,  wood-peckers, bluejays and others.  Just a few years ago Mr. Cooke, who  has done so much for bird students,  said: . "It is yet unexplained why  some birds, notably many of the  warblers, retire in winter to such  great distances southward. Some  even crossing the equator and passing several hundred miles beyond,  certainly neither cold nor hunger  can be the cause of such wanderings." Just here I wish to tell you  of some of the latest discoveries  made by aviators. In studying the  flights of birds in connection with  their flying machines, they have  found that birds take advantage of  the upper air currents in flying, and  this explains the long continuous  flights that have been such a mystery  heretofore.  When the birds reach these air currents they sort of fold back their  wings and are carried forward at  tremendous speed with very little ef-	87863764 Bytes	5000	5856	985002427	RGB	8	600	asm04000001520070001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1452	1452	1453.jp2	/asm0400/image/1453.jp2

It is very much  as a bullet goes through the air after being shot from the gun. They  fly thousands of miles in a night.  The golden plover makes a flight  across the ocean from Nova Scotia  to South America a distance of 2500  miles without stopping. The routes  taken by different species of birds  have been a very interesting study  and maps showing these routes remind one of railroads marked out on  maps. It is very curious to notice  how cleverly they get around a large  body of water or a desert place where  food is scarce—especially birds that  do not make such long flights.  Altnough one of      the      principal  routes of water birds passes just to  the east of us, this is not a favorite  route with  land  blrr'i, which  fly in  day time and top frequently for food  and rest.    Water birds fly mostly at  night  when  migrating.    As may  be  supposed, there are many casualties  occurring on these long journeys.    I  remember hearing one of the attendants  of  the  Washington   Monument  say that hundreds of birds were killed by striking against that tall shaft.  Man has erected many lighthouses  along  the  coast,  more  than   3,000,  for his own safety, but thousands of  birds kill themselves yearly by striking against these light. Fowey Rocks  and Sombrero Key lights are responsible for more deaths in this    way  than any others.    The reason is twofold:     Their geographic position and  the character of their lights.    Both  are situated at the southern end of  Florida where thousands    of    birds  pass each season, to and from Cuba.  Both lights are of the first magnitude  on towers 100 to 140 feet high, and  Fowey Rocks has a fixed white light  the deadliest of all.  A red light or a rapidly flashing  one repels the birds but a steady  white light piercing the storm and  fog proves irresistable. From whatever direction they aproach they veer  to windward and then flying against  the wind seek the object of their infatuation. The larger part do not  strike hard enough to injure themselves but like great moths, they  flutter in and out of the light's rays  and finally settle on the platform or  frame work to await the abatement  of the storm or the coming of sufficient daylight to enable them once  more to orient themselves.  All black poll warblers winter in  South America, says Mr. Cooke.  Those that are to nest in Alaska  strike straight across the Caribbean  Sea to Florida and go northwestward  to the Mississippi river. Then the  direction changes and a course is  laid almost due north to northern  Minnesota in order to avoid the treeless plains of North    Dakota.    But  when the forests of the Saskatchewan are reached the northwestern  course is resumed and, with a slight  verging toward the west* is held until the nesting site in the Alaska  spruces is reached. The cliff swallows are winter neighbors in South  America of the blackpoll warblers.  But when in early spring nature  prompts the swallows who are to  nest in Nova Scotia to seek the far  off land where they were hatched  they begin their journey to that region—which is situated exactly  north of their winter abode by a  westward flight of several hundred  miles to Panama. Thence they move  leisurely along the western shore of  the Caribbean Sea to Mexico and,  still avoiding the long trip over water, go completely around the western end oi the gulf. Hence, as they  cross Louisiana they are moving in i  the opposite direction from that in i  which they started. A northeasterly j  course from Louisiana to Maiije and |  an easterly one to Nova Scotia completes their spring migration. This  circuitous route has added more  than 2000 miles to the distance  traveled We ask why should the  swallow elect so much more roundabout a route than that taken by the  warbler? The warbler is a night  migrant. Soon after nightfall it  starts on its way through the darkness toward some favorite lunch station, usually several hundred miles  distant, where it rests and feeds for  several days before undertaking the  &gt;next stage of its journey. Its migration consists of a series of long  flights from one feeding ground to  the next and naturally it takes the  most direct course between stations,  not deviating for any body of water  that can be compassed in a single  flight.  On the other hand the swallow is  a day migrant. Little and often is  its rule. It begins its spring migration several weeks earlier than the  warbler and catches each day's ration of flying insects during a few  hours of slow evolutions, which at.  the same time accomplish the work'  of migration. It keeps along the insect teeming shores, and the 2000 extra miles, thereby added to the migration route are but a tithe of the  distance covered in pursuit of its daily food.  I might go on at great length to  describe minutely how the palm  warbler winters in the Gulf States,  from Louisiana eastward and  throughout the greater Antilles to  Porto Rico. The Louisiana birds nest  in Labrador and those from the Antilles cut diagonally across the United States to summer in central Canada.    The two routes cross each oth-  ifi	86082888 Bytes	4872	5888	4032212446	RGB	8	600	asm04000001520071001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1453	1453	1454.jp2	/asm0400/image/1454.jp2

While I was  in  Texas last  fall  I  met Mrs. M. B. Davis of Waco, whose  husband is State president of the Audubon Society     That evening I called upon them at a nearby sanitarium  where  they   were  staying     for     his  health.    He  was     enthusiastic,     although very nervous and he told me  this beautiful little story of the golden plover:     "The golden plover has  but  one  meal of fruit  during    the  year and it flies from the Antartic to  the Arctic Zone to get it.    Each year  late in summer the snow melts at a  certain place near the Arctic Circle  at the same date each year.     These  birds know that and time their visit  just in time to get there and eat the  berries that are just  ripe when  the  snow  melts."    This  story  is  a  true  one.    The golden  plover  spends  six  months in  Argentina  then  finds  its  way back to the Arctic coast of North  America  by  a long  and     circuitous  route,  rears its young there and as  soon as they are old enough to care  for themselves, fall migration is begun by a trip to the Labrador coast  where the plover  fattens  for a few  weeks on the abundant native fruits.  A   short  trip   across  the   St.     Lawrence  brings  it  to  Nova  Scotia  the  starting point for its    extraordinary  ocean flight due south  to the coast  of South America.    If the weather is  good it ma^es the whole trip of 2,-  400 miles without pause    or    rest.  When  it  finally reaches its winter  abode in Argentina it has made an  8000  mile trip.    The Pacific golden  plover even exceeds this distance in  making its changes.  The shore-birds such as the golden plover, present the longest migration  routes    among    land     feeding  birds; but even their surprising records are surpassed  by some of  the  birds which  glean their living from  the  waters.    The  world's  migration  champion is the Arctic tern.    It deserves the name of Arctic for it nests  as far north  as land has  been  discovered; that is as far north as the  bird  can  find  anything    stable     on  which   to   construct     its   nest.    The.  first nest found by man in this re-!  gion,  only  7   1-2   degrees  from   the  pole, contained a downy chick, surrounded  by  a wall  of  newly  fallen  snow that had been scooped out of  the nest by the parent.    When the  young are full grown the entire family   leaves   the   Arctics   and   several  months  later  they  are found  skirting the edge of the Antartic  continent.    What their track is over that  11,000 miles of intervening space, no  one knows.    A few scattered individ- j  ruals have been noted along the Unit-1  ed   States   coast  south   to  Long   Island  but the great  flocks of  thousands and thousands of these terns  which alternate from one pole to the  other have never been met by any  trained ornithologists competent    to  learn their preferred path and their  time schedule.  The Arctic terns^arrive in the far  north   about   June   15th,   and   leave j  about August 25th, thus staying 14  weeks at the nesting      site.    They  probably   spend a few weeks longer'  in  the  winter than  in the  summeri  home;   and,  if so,  this  leaves them  scarcely 30 weeks for the round trip  of 22,000 miles.     Not less than 150  in a straight line must be their daily  task  and this is undoubtedly multiplied   several  times  by  their  zigzag  twistings and turnings in search of  food.    The  Arctic  terns  have  more  hours of daylight and sunlight than  any other animals on the globe.    At  their most northern nesting site the  midnight  sun  has  already appeared  before their arrival and it never sets  during their entire stay at the breeding grounds. Durirrg the two months  of their sojourn in the Antartic they,  do not see a sunset and for the rest j  of the time the sun dips only a lit- j  j tie way below the horizon and broad  ; daylight  continues  all     night.     The  I birds therefore have 24 hours of day-  ; light for at least eight months in the  | year,   anu   during   the   other     four  months have considerably more daylight than darkness.  The number of miles traveled each  day by a migrating bird varies greatly in different parts of the journey.  These variations seem to correspond  to the variations in the northward  march of spring  The robin has been studied closely, no doubt because of its tame nature and the ease with which it can  be identified. It is only recently  that the robins have found out the  desirability of Biscayne" Bay as a  winter resort. For three years*,  ' many have come here. I have In-  | tended to take notes, so as to remem-  ' ber the dates of their arrival and departure, but have not done so. They  were here about two months this  year and left the last of February.  They adapt spring's time table for  their own, and as soon as it gets  about freezing, further north, they  begin their march, going very slowly at first, about 13 miles a day. The  speed is gradually increased until  near the end of the journey two  months later they fly 70 miles a day.  They breed mostly in the far north  —Alaska, British Columbia and Newfoundland. Most migrants, except  ducks, geese and robins, wait in their  warm winter quarters until spring  time is far advanced, and then traveling swiftly, occupy only a few days  in their vernal migration. While the  Alaska breeding robins start off in  February and spend nearly 90 days  in going from central Missouri to  western Alaska the black poll warbler remains in his tropical home during February and March, and is not  seen in Southern Florida until about  April 20. By the first of May he arrives in central Missouri, which the  robins left 60 days earlier, and yet  he reaches northwestern Alaska only  10 days later than the robin, thus  making the trio in one third the  time.  7%  m	85429012 Bytes	4848	5872	2173022514	RGB	8	600	asm04000001520073001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1455	1455	1456.jp2	/asm0400/image/1456.jp2

Special Collections	Woman’s Club of Coconut Grove Records	ASM0400										asm0400000152						asm04000001520074001		The black poll warbler furnishes a fine example of speed acceleration during the latter part of migration.  The first 10 days he makes an average of 30 miles a day, the next 10  days an average of 100 miles a day  while the last few days he flies 300  miles a day.  Another interesting feature of migration is the narrowness of the migration range of some birds, notably  the scarlet tanager, compared with  the width of the summer and winter  homes. This tanager nests from  New Brunswick to Saskatchewan, a  region extending over 1900 miles of  longitude. The Missisippi Valley  birds go south and the New England  birds southeast until they all leave  the United States along 800 miles of.  Gulf coast from Texas to Florida.  The migration lines continue to converge until in south central America  they are not more than 100 miles  apart. Arrived in South American  for the winter the birds scatter over  a district about one half the area  of the summer home with an extreme east and west range of about  700  miles.  The summer home of the bobolink  is from Cape Breton to Saskatchewan, 2300 miles, and the migration  lines converge toward the ricefields  of the south, the objective point of  all bobolinks, no matter where they  nest. Having gorged themselves to  repletion, they press on to Brazil,  their winter home.  Without doubt many changes have  taken place in the habits of    many  birds,  but  few  are  known  as    yet.' i  Even   in  the   last   50   years   several  changes have been noted in the bobolink.    When  the   virgin   forests  of  New  England  were  converted     into  grain fields and  meadows     by    the  white man, the bobolinks took advantage of their opportunity and  their  numbers greatly increased until the  modern mowing machines and  hay-  rakes   destroyed   thousands  of  their  nests and caused a marked diminution  of   their   numbers.    Again   the  bobolinks were formerly cut off from  the   western   states,   because     they  must have the damp meadows to be  normal;  but with the advent of irrigation, large areag were brought under cultivation and little colonies of  bobolinks  are appearing here     and  there, almost to the Pacific.    If we  would take notes on birds from year  to year the  subject  would  soon  be  intensely     interesting.     A     woman  who lived in Michigan a number of  years, told  me that the barn swallows left her home there  regularly  on the  29 th of August.    This year  the whippoorwill sang his first note  in hearing of my house on March 12.  /&lt;£  Next  year  I   shall   try  to  listen  for  him  on  that  date.    The  little wren  who has been  nesting  in  the  fence-  near   my   kitchen   door   for   several  years,  came on  the  28 th  of March  this year, and  I heard the meadow  larks on the  29th.    I do  not  know  whether any larks remain here during the winter or not, but they aro  always here in the spring and summer and their music always delights  me.    While  in Texas  last  fall    the  birds that interested me most  were  : the Paradise-bird  or scissors-tail as  | they are commonly  called.     I     saw  j great   flocks  of  them   everywhere   I  went  in   September   and       October.  They are more beautfiul and dainty  in shape than our mockingbird and  far more beautiful in coloring. They  go out into the fields just before sunrise in the morning and just before  sunset they come in to some favorite  clump of trees near a house, in the  country or else in the towns.     I asked a  ranchman  about  them and  he  said:      "The  scissors-tail   is  a  good  bird.    I  don't  know  any  harm     of  him;   he  eats  insects and does  not  bother the crops."  As I close this paper, I feel like  pledging myself to give more time to  the study of these wonderful creatures than I have ever done, and I  hope that others will join me in this  pleasure.	85233880 Bytes	4824	5888	3462647240	RGB	8	600	asm04000001520074001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1456	1456	1457.jp2	/asm0400/image/1457.jp2

It would really take  too much time and space to enumerate on the work done in the different grades, which showed the interest of the pupils, ana gave credit  to the efficiency of the teacnlng of  Principal Asbury, and Miss Baker  of the primary grade. Special mention may be made of the special  work done outside of the school by  one of the boys and which took the  eye of the housekeepers. That was  a beautiful chocolate cake made by  John Clinkenbeard which he presented to the ladies to serve with their  refreshments. Surely this boy will  be a great help to his mother.  There was also an exhibit of many  beautiful, useful and quaint baskets by Mrs. Haden, and also wood  carving by Mrs. DeGuizelle.  Mrs. John Gifford displayed many  rare candlesticks, one in the form of  the sacred bay tree, also extinguishers, and odd little oil lamps which  looked as though they might have  belonged .to the wise virgins. Many  of these were gathered by Mrs. Gifford, on her trip abroad.  Mrs. J. L; Nugent also brought a  collection of very unique bells used  in the far away lands of her travels  —possibly the most noted of these  were the bells within bells, "three  in one" presumably worn by the  camels crossing  the deserts.  There were songs by children and  a short address by Hrs. Asbury  thanking the housekeepers for their  interest in the school work and  their hospitaltiy during the past  year. Refreshments were then served.  The next meeting of tne club will  be held April 19 and arrangements  will be made for the club's twenty-  first birthday party which will take  place on Thursday, April 25.	85863860 Bytes	4840	5912	2709530516	RGB	8	600	asm04000001520075001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1457	1457	1458.jp2	/asm0400/image/1458.jp2

There are few clubs in Florida  that can boast of having had twenty  teas—especially teas such as are  given iy this famous club. They  are veritable banquets* and are always the crowning event of the social season at Cocoanut Grove.  All of the memhers are urged to  be present. ^H  Housekeepers' Club Appropriately  Celebrate Twenty-First Birthday  The crowning event of the twenty- j  one years since the organization of  the Housekeepers' Club, at Cocoanut  Grove, was the celebration of the  twenty-first birthday of the club on  Thursday afternoon, April twenty-  fifth, from four to six o'clock, at the  club-house.  Despite the unfavorable weather in  te morning it was braved by the undaunted president. Miss Flora McFarlane, who accompanied by Mrs.  Dearborn, wended their way through  the storm to prepare the table for  the supper.  As the day advanced and donations  in the way of palms, cut flowers, and  good things for the making out of  the menu began to arrive none attracted more attention or was more  appreciated than the beautiful flowers and cake brought by Mrs. DeBog-  ory for this faithful friend has to  ride many miles on a tricycle to the  club meetings;  Those who had expected that the  "tea" would be called off on account  of the storm were amazed and gratified to note, as the members and  friends began to gather, that at four  o'clock, the house was filled with a  merry laughing throng. Everyone  seemed nappy even those with sadness in their hearts caused by the recollection of the loss of the loved ones  who had mingled with many of those  present under the beloved old roof  in the "good old times" referred to  in Mrs. Munroe's paper.  Covers were laid for sixty-four and  many of these had to be reset as supper was served to nearly one hundred.  The house was decorated with, cocoanut palms and cut flowers, the  color scheme of yellow and white, the  clufc colors, being carried out ia the  floral decorations. There were roses  in abundance,, jessamine, allamanda,  white oleanders, and that more rare  and beautiful flower, franjiperii.  ■^■■■■■H	85192088 Bytes	4848	5856	2690869066	RGB	8	600	asm04000001520078001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1460	1460	1461.jp2	/asm0400/image/1461.jp2

The idea of the  birthday cake was suggested by one  of the old and valued members of  the clubt Mrs. C. J. Peacock, who  was too 'ill to make it or to attend  the "tea."  As the time for serving arrived the  club's founder, honorary president  and president, Miss Flora McFarlane,  gathered around her the guests of  honor. Mrs. J. S. Frederick, president  of the State Federation, Mrs. T. V.  Moore, president of the Woman's  Club of Miami, Mrs. Kirk Munroe,  president of the Folio Club of Cocoanut Grove, Library, also ex-nxesi-  dent of the Housekeepers' Club having served several terms at different  times, Mrs. E. A. Rickmers, corresponding secretary of the State Federation, the ex-pfesidents of the club,  Mrs. Isabella Peacock, Mrs. Emma  Swanson, Mrs. Florence P. Haden,  Mrs. Anna K. Dearborn, Mrs. S. V.  R. Carpenter, Mrs. Grace Manlove,  and Mrs. Wade, secretary of the present administration.  The other tables were assigned to  the other officers of the club who  found places for the members and  their Mends. Before taking their  seats the assembled guests reverently bowed their heads while Rev. Dr.  Jackson invoked the divine blessing  on those present.  Mrs. Frederick, the toast mistress  for the occasion, in a few well chosen words proposed a toast to the  founder of the club, Miss Flora McFarlane. Mrs. Gifford has made the  club a birthday gift of several dozen dainty glasses, which were used  for the toasts during the "tea." Miss  MacFarlane responded in her gracious and charming manner, welcoming members and guests,. and  gave a brief outline of how she started the club with a little band of women twenty-one years ago with the as  sistance of Mrs. Isabelle Peacock, the  "Mother of Cocoanut Grove," Mrs.  Kirk Munroe, Mrs. C. J. Peacock,  Mrs. Martha Peacock, "Aunt Martha/' Mrs. William Fuzzard and other good women.  As the country began to open up  and new people came, the membership grew until there are now seventy-one members. The club was incorporated in 1897, and the building  started the same year. There was a  small mortgage which was paid off by  the ladies giving bazaars and Other  entertainments.  In 1901, during Mrs. Dearborn's  presidency, the mortgage was canceled. The occasion was celebrated  with a New Tear's party. After a  brief address by Mrs. Dearborn, she  handed the mortgage to the founder  on a tray. This ended the indebtedness, and the club has never owed  anything since and never expects to.  Mr. Ralph Munroe donated the  grounds on which the club-house  stands and it has the distinction of  being the most southerly club-house  in the United States.  The other toasts were responded  to in the following order: Mrs. Kirk  Munroe^ Mrs. S. V. R, Carpenter,  Mrs. Eclna Rickmers, Mrs. T. V.  Moore, of Miami, and Mrs. Wade.  These toasts were all so good, that  the Metropolis will take pleasure in  publishing them in full later.  After the conclusion of the last  toast all present joined in singing  "Auld Lang Syne" and Praise God  from Whom All Blessings Flow, and  the members and guests departed after many congratulations and good  wishes for the contikued prosperity  of the dub, declaring that the birthday party had been a grand success  and ay far the most enjoyable event  in the club's history.	85491168 Bytes	4832	5896	3165816559	RGB	8	600	asm04000001520079001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1461	1461	1462.jp2	/asm0400/image/1462.jp2

Old Times and New Called to Memory «  Housekeepers Club Twenty-First A\  There certainly is not a woman's  club in Florida — perhaps in the  world—that has the peculiar charm  that is found about the Housekeepers' Club of Cocoanut Grove, whose  aim has been from the beginning of  its existence to live up to its name,  although during the years it has  branched out into very nearly ever}''  department of modern club work.  At the twenty-first annual tea,  given a week ago, much of the history of the organization and of the  ear'y days in Dade County were given in the toasts, which the Metropolis is having the pleasure of publishing today.  Miss MacFarlane, who founded  he club, and who has been its honorary president ever since, was mistress of ceremonies and introduced  the toast mistress, Mrs. J. S. Frederick, who made the following introductory speech:  Mrs. J. S. Frederick's Talk.  "To you favored dwellers in this  present day of rock roads, automobiles and motorcycles, it is almost  impossible to realize the conditions  that existed or the shores of beautiful Biscayne Bay twenty-one years;  ago.  "Where  now  the  distant  farmer j  comes gliding into town in his well-1  laden car, in those days the weary!  homesteaders   struggled   and   stumbled  on the  sharp  rocks  and  even  rougher  palmetto   roots  of  the  infrequent foot paths through the endless pine forest, which were rendered still more difficult by the crowding palmettoes.  "Many a time have I seen such a  plodder, bent nearly double with the  burden of his produce, a few vegetables, eggs, and possibly a little fruit  stowed in the inevitably gunny sack  which had on some previous occasions contained the ever necessary  fertilizer, and had been carried out  to the little clearing in the same  fatiguing manner.  "Of course, the Mecca of these  weary pilgrims was ever 'the store,'  where the hardly earned produce  was exchanged for the inevitable  canned goods, tomatoes, roast beef,  milk, corn meal, sugar and coffee.  How pitifully small was the pile,  aud yet how very, very heavy before  the long returning miles were accomplished!  "Now came the dissipation or rue  week, a rest and gossip, while waiting for the musical sound of the  conch shell, which wafted over the  Bay should herald the coming of  the little sail boat which twice a  week brought the longed-for news  from homes and friends far away.  "Sometimes adverse winds caused  the boat to ha so late that one disappointed farmer must e'en shoulder  his burden, and warned by the  lengthening shadows, start on his  homeward way.  "Today, two, three or five miles  before the rushing car, and our farmer is home ere the kettle is steaming. Not so twenty-one years ago.  Then it was one step forward and  often slip or stumble back two on  the dreadful rocks, so that every  foot of path was an achievement.  Meanwhile,.miles away in the lonely  pine forest, the patient wife is sitting on the door step, a sacred section of pine tree, which serves as  entrance to the palmetto thatched  homestead house. Probably two :&gt;r  three youngstrs are clinging to her,  eagerly demanding 'How soon will  daddy come?" To divert their insistent inquiries as well as to allay  her own nervous fears, she tells  wonderful stories of the far-distant  home and the loved ones she left so  far behind when she came a bride  to take up a homestead in the wonderful Southland, where, according  to the prospector's eloquent pen, a  man needed only to live to make a  fortune in a few short months.  "There are a few women who can  well remember their vigils while the  sunset faded and one by one the  stars came out, and even today I  warrant they can feel ,the delightful  thrills of joy at the well-known  whistle which told the eager listeners that Daddy was actually near.  What fun it was for $he youngsters  to unpack the groceries, roll around  the tins, while father and mother  read and discussed the letters and  papers which, in spite of the waiting supper, demanded their attention.  "To a woman in this environment  fancy what a boon it was to have  an opportunity to meet other women—to look into their faces and  listen to their voices.	86214608 Bytes	4840	5936	2699779831	RGB	8	600	asm04000001520084001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1466	1466	1467.jp2	/asm0400/image/1467.jp2

Toasts  wtual Tea  "This thought became so compelling that an enthusiastic woman,  longing to help the lonely sister,  planned and started that organization which has been so potent a factor in the developing of Cocoanut  Grove, so I ask you to drink to the  health of Miss Flora MacFarlane,  the first president of the Housekeepers'  Club."  Miss MacFarlane's Response.  Miss MacFarlane did not have a  forma' paper, but talked in her de-  I lightful way about the early days in  I Cocoanut Grove.    She was the first  I woman to take up a homestead In  Dade   County   and   her   cabin   near  where  the  present  postofllce  is  at  Cocoanut   Grove  was  the  gathering  place  of  the  little  band  of women  who in those pioneer days so longed  for the companionship of other women, and the comforts of "civilization."  Vigorous and generous and kind,  Miss MacFarlane is very dear to the  members of the Housekeeper's Club  and her talk was especially enjoyed.  In introducing Mrs. Munroe,  whose toast, "The Good Old Times,"  followed the one to Miss MacFarlane, Mrs. J. S. Frederick, the toast  mistress, said:  "Biscayne Bay and Kirk Munroe  have for so many years mutually  suggested each other, that there  could be no one more appropriate  to respond to the toast, 'The Good  Old Times,' than Mrs. Kirk Munroe."  Mrs. Munroe then read the following paper:  "The Good Old Times."  "In the good old times, when we  had no railroad here; when to get  here on had either to walk the beach  from Lake Worth or come by sailing  vessel* from , Key West. When we  were lucky If we had mail twice a  j month, and to procure late newspa-  I pers Commodore Ralph Munroe  used to sail out to Fowey Rock light-  1  house and beg for the New York  papers that the captains of the passing steamers never failed to toss overboard for the keepers of the light.  Now we cannot be provoked enouga  it our morning and evening papers  are not delivered on time, or the R.  F. p. is a bit late.  "The good old days when we had  oil lamps and candles, mostly obtained from wrecks, instead of acetylene and electric lights, when every  cottage had a smudge pot to keep  mosquitoes down, when cheese clofi  was used in place of wire screens,  when a wreck on the beach of a  'general cargo' order was our greatest excitment and joy—if no lives  were lost. When we had to make  our own yeast cake, when there was  but one store in the county, Brick-  ell's at Miami, no roads in the  county, only trails through the pine  woods most of them made by Indians. Whem there were no locks to  our doors, and all political differen-  | ces were fought out over a good  dinner at Mr. Peacock's. When we  had to cook with wood, and sometimes out of doors, instead of in the  well-equipped kitchens now in Cocoanut Grove with gas, oil or coal  stoves.    When a dozen eggs was a  P gift worth something, and, best of  all, when there were no saloons.  Yes, they were good times.  "But if any of us who are gathered here today meet again in  twenty-one years, we will speak of  this occasion as belonging to 'tho  good old times.'  "It is hard to realize that twenty-  one years have gone into the past  since the first gathering of earnest  women who met in the pine wood  wilderness of Biscayne Bay to found  a Housekeepers' Club for the purpose of solving household difficulties, better care of children, an I  above all, to know each other, for  we were then a scattered community.  "Those were the days of real  housekeeping, for we all did our  own work, including washing, and  did it well, and if any of us had a  new cake receipt or jelly test, we  never rest until every woman m  sight shared it.  "Will any here, who were present  at our first annual tea ever forget  it? How we decorated the little  room in which it was held, with pine  branches and palmetto leaves and  wild flowers! How at a good deal  of trouble we secured two new  brooms which we crossed over the  door and tied with red ribbons, and  instead of pictures on the walls we  hung between th pialmetto leaves  aprons, baby caps, sacques and dresses that we had been making for a  fair! And how beautiful we thought  it all was!  "There were Just twenty-three  present including members, and tt  will interest those who knew them  to hear their names: Miss MacFarlane, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Peacock,  ! Mr. and Mrs. C. J. Peacock, Mrs.  , Jack Peacock, Mr. and Mrs. John  Pent, Miss Lillie Pinder, Mr. and  Mts. Joseph Frow, Mrs. Newbold,  Mr. and Mrs. E. U White, Mr. and  Mrs. Kirk Munroe, Mrs. Rosa Richards, Mr. Jacobs, Mr. Richard Car-  noy, Mr. Nugent, Mr. McDonald,  Mr. and Mrs. George Roberts and  Commodore Ralph Munroe.  "Miss MacFarlane and Mrs. Peacock received, Mrs. Kirk Munroe  had the tea table, and Mrs. Newbold.  Mrs. Richards and Mrs. Frow served  the cake and chicken and sandwiches.  "Every lone man in the county  was invited to our teas, and we fed  them so well that if we had asked  for even a 'vote' we should have got  it then.  "Yes, it is good to remember  when the club had more than one  motto. When each week at the  meetings some one of the members  would propose a motto to live by  during the week, and then tell at  the following meeting how we had  put the motto to use.  "I remember now the one, 'Do  unto others as you would they  should do unto you/ worked, and  'Think before you speak.' Shall I  ever forget how I worked that one.  1 am afraid such a thing would be  thought simple now, but then it did  help us to feel that twelve other women were living up to the motto  we were.  "Those were the days when some  one, usually 'Aunt Tilly,' Mrs. John  Pent, or Miss Kittie Roberts, took  charge of the babies of the members  on club afternoons until four o'clock  when all the babies would come  trooping in and we held a baby  show. Very many of those babies  now have babies of their own.  "Those were the days when every one of us went to Mrs. Isabelle  Peacock-—rightly called the 'Mother  of Cocoanut Grove'—for all kinds:  of help, all the way down from making light bread to the latest fashions in shirt waist trimming, for  Mrs. Peacock always took note oi  all the interesting garments worn by  the strangers who occasionally  stopped for a night at the Bay View  Hotel, afterwards the Peacock Inn.  "And those were the days in  which we old settlers say we lived  on the 'fat of the land;* fresh venison, green turtle, gopher conch,  crawfish, wild turkey, sweet potatoes, that one never sees now, Seminole squash, coonty, home-made  and Indian made. The days when  the woods were full of huckleberries, and cocoa plums could be gathered by the bushel baskets full, and  pine apples came from the keys,  and, as for guaras, every one had  plenty.

Dudley Warner.  "Those were the days when Sunday was kept, not even a boat on the  Bay, uo motorcycles, or automobiles  joy 'rides,  and  if  ever  the  churcn  history of this place is written,  it  I will  begin with the  afternoon services held at that time, when everyone far and near came.    When Mrs  Peacock read the prayers and chapter from the Bible, after which some  of  us  would  read  or  tell  a  story, j  and very often the afternoon would j  end with the serving of a cake or a \  cup of tea at some neighbors.  "Then, too, can one ever forget !  the royal welcome those of us who !  went north for the summer always j  received on returning?    For before j  Khe railroad we had to come and go  by sailboat, and when our schooner  was sighted all of our neighbors  would come out in small boats before we had anchored to greet us,  and such a welcome as we always  had from the 'Mother of Cocoanut  Grove'! Indeed, I could make you  jealous telling you of the bread and  cake, jelly, cooked fish and other  comforts that would be sent in the  first week to help me. The last time  I went north, (last year), I was  home for ten days before any one  knew I had arrived, and some never  knew I had been away. So they  were good days for we knew each  other, helped each other, and did  rot criticise any act without thought  and always with kindness.  "I am proud of having been one  of the founders of the Housekeepers' Club and .on looking back the  one thing that is foremost is the  club's record for the right. The club  house has been generously loanea  for all good work. It has not become a place for card parties or a  public dance hall to be had at a  Price—not that cards or dancing are  wrong only in the way they are indulged in—and so, little by little,  the club has grown and stretched  out to broader fields of usefulness  But no matter what it may do or not  do it owes its existence to the 'good  old times,' and now that 'the good  old times' have passed for some of  us, and may not be altogether forgotten, I am going to present as a  mascot to the club one of the pictures that hung on the walls at the  first annual tea. I have kept it for  this moment for twenty-one years,  and I am glad I can give it into the  bands of the woman we all love and  know as the founder of the Housekeepers' Club, Miss Flora MacFarlane." ,  At the conclusion of Mrs. Kirk  Munroe's paper, Mrs. Frederick  called upon Mrs. S. V. R. Carpenter  for her toast to the "Past Presidents" anl it was given in the sweet  way so characteristic of everything  she does.  Mrs. Carpenter's Response.  "From   the   birth   of   the   House-  | keepers' Ciub, twenty-one years ago,  ! its  affairs have  been presided  over  'by  women  of  superior wisdom  and  sterling worth.    In its early infancy  in the pioneer days    of    Cocoanut  Grove,   club   work   was   necessarily  primitive,  and yet it was none the  less faithfully performed.  "These early presidents are writh  us today, and limited time alone deters me from eulogizing them individually and portraying their services as they deserve. One of these  has risen in club work to the highest  rank in the gift of the State Federation of Woman's Clubs, and we are  very glad to proclaim that this lady  is  one  of  our  pioneer  presidents.  "Each of our presidents has done  some special thing in her administration to mark her term of office.  That the club has steadily progressed with the times, standing today financially independent, socially prominent and morally a recognized corporation for the good of  this community, is a living tribute  to the efficient discharge of duties  by these past occupants of the seat  of honor.  "I might launch rainbow ribbons  of enthusiastic encomiums, but native modesty forbids, being a past  president myself. I can only say,  but for the sweet helpfulness, and  loving sympathy given me at all  times by our club members, my efforts must have been of little worth.  Thus demonstrating that the president is not the 'whole cheese' by  any means.  "And now, beautiful and brilliant  assembly of past presidents—past,  but not passed—I shower roses, and  many blossoms, and sweet mignonette and white carnations, and rosemary, for remembrance, upon yon  all, hoping to meet you, with none  missing, at our next 'annual tea.' "  "The Present Administration.'*  "May  the  administration  of  the  Introducing Mrs. Wade, who came  next on the program, with the toast  to "The Present Administration,"  Mrs. Frederick said:  "The fast flying years have  wrought many changes, and few of  the original members now meet on  Thursday afternoons, but their places have been filled by others imbued  with no less enthusiasm and many  new ideas so now we shall turn the  pages rapidly and call upon Mrs.  Wade, the club's present secretary,  to respond to the toast."  I coming year be all and more than  we hope for.   We expect to do great  things.  "The Housekeepers* club is a  united body of women firm and set  in these purposes and ready to stand  for the betterment of the community, ready to respond to the call of  any worthy cause, waiting for an  opportunity to get our machinery at  work.  "But as we have outgrown our  bib and tucker and reached our  twenty-first birthday, we feel grown  up and of age, and we must fall in  line and keep up with the times,  bo we will have a little new work  on our next year's program, a little  political training just to keep us  posted.  "We are sure that we shall be no  worse off, and we are sure that Cocoanut Grove will be so much better  off, as we can soon enlighten them  on so many important questions.  "We expect to organize a Civic  League and a Junior League. We  do not propose to cut out the good  old times we have had; we only  want to be a little wiser and become  better acquainted with the ways of  the world.  "May we then work together in  good fellowship for fun and for  profit."  Following Mrs. Wade, Mrs. Frederick said:  "When the 165,000 women of the  New York City Federation 'boycotted butter,' and by their united action forced the price of that important article of food from 60 cents  to 37 cents per pound in New York  City, they proved conclusively the  \alue of federating. We here in our  state may accomplish like wonders  if we choose, so I will give you the  toast "The Florida Federation of  Woman's Clubs,' and call upon Mr^.  E. A. Rickmers, state corresponding  secretary, to reply to the same."  To which Mrs. Rickmers responded as follows:  The Florida Federation.  "In the midst of all the sentiment  and romance centered in the House-  Keepers' Club this day. 'The Federation' might seem prosaic were it not  that the beautiful spirit which pervades this club today glorifies all  ciub work with the same light to  love and service.	86503200 Bytes	4856	5936	3076034933	RGB	8	600	asm04000001520086001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1468	1468	1469.jp2	/asm0400/image/1469.jp2

For with one accord we are all  joined together to more and more  serve the Master."  Mrs. Frederick then introduced!  Mrs. T. V. Moore, of Miami, who  was on the program for the toast  "Our Sister Club," by saying:  "Twenty-one years ago when the  Cocoanut Grove women were moved  by a spirit of sociability, they made  up a little party and persuaded  some of the men folks to take them  for a sail up the Bay. Their destination was usually 'Brickell's store'  at the mouth of the Miami river.  Here too was the beautiful home of  Mrs. Julia D. Tuttle, and many a  pleasant visit was enjoyed in these  two notable places. How we should  have opened our eyes in those days  had we beheld the members of the  Housekeepers' Club today visiting  'The Woman's Club of Miami!' I  will give you the toast 'Our Sister  Club,' Mrs. T. V. Moore, President."  Mrs. Moore then, in her beautiful  self-possessed manner, gave a delightful little talk in which she  briefly outlined the work of the  Miami Club, telling what it had  done and of its plans and ambitions  for the future.  Mrs. Frederick then rose and  said:  "And now, before we say goodnight, I ask you all to rise as we  give thfc toast 'The Housekeepers'  Club*—past—present—and   future."	88382860 Bytes	5040	5844	3366943468	RGB	8	600	asm04000001520087001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1469	1469	1470.jp2	/asm0400/image/1470.jp2

HOT WEATHER  WARNS CITY TO CLEAN UP  Weeds and Objectionable Plants  And Harbors for Mosquitoes  Must be Eliminated  Mayor Smith Thinks it Important for  toe People of Miami to Get Ready  for the Heat of Summer—Issues a  Proclamation for a General Cleaning Up of the City.  Mayor S. Rodmond Smith this  morning issued a proclamation declaring May 13 a cleaning up day  and advising all good citizens to exert their best efforts to make the  city a cleaner and better place on  that day.  At his office this morning, Mayor  Smith was greeted by his many  friends who were delighted to see  him enjoying such good health. To  a Metropolis reporter the mayor stated that he believed that now was the  time for citizens to get busy, rid the  community of all trash, and work for  the betterment of the city.  The proclamation reads as follows:  Proclamation.  Whereas, in these tropical environments the rainy season common to  such latitudes is about due It is  at this period of the year and until  November that our rainfall is relatively greater than during the winter months, and that nature puts  forth her greatest efforts to cover  the earth with plant growth. Weeds  and objectionable plants spring up  with great rapidity; and unless they  are checked, quickly become miniature forests for the development or  malaria, and afford a harbor for mosquitoes, flies and other insects.  In the interest or tne puouc neaiui,  this should be prevented as far as  possible by cutting down there rank  growths and moving away the refuse.  I therefore order and direct that  Monday, the 13th day of May 1^12,  bo observed as a cleaning up day  throughout the city; and I call up  all citizens and persons residing in  the community to give this matter  their personal attention and to aid  the authorities in the effort to keep  this city clean and attractive, and  free from all forms of malaria and  disease.  .Done at the city of Miami, Florida, this 4th day of May, 1912.

They consider the year the most successful  in the history, of the school. The  /hearty spisit of co-operation mani-  'tested by the patrons and the Housekeepers' Club, is most commendable,  \and has made the very high degree  of success attained, a possibility.  The school has given two entertainments at the Housekeepers' Club  (which were largely attended.    More  than $75 was cleared, a splendid or-  ffean purchased and a fund started for  the library.    The pupils nave  been-  given unstinted praise ifor the man-'  ner  in  which  they acquitted   themselves in the public programs.  The  members  of  the  Housekeep-j  ers' Club also gave the school an opportunity to give an exhibit of schoo  work.    It was enjoyed and appreciat  ed by a large number of people.  Mr. James Bolton showed his public spirit in a very practical and commendable way by offering as a prize  a watch to the boy in the high school  class who ranked first in scholarship  application and deportment. George  iPeaoocfc worn the prize and his  riends wish him great success in all  uture undertakings.  The Folio Club offered a prize to  he pupil writing the best feook review.    Mr. John Clinkenbeard won  the prlaae.

There will be dancing In  the evening.  Nearly all the ladies present  Thursday signified their intention of  attending the reception which the  Miami Woman's Club is giving; them  on next Tuesday. Those having au-  tos and desirous of helping others  not so fortunate would do well to  arrange before Tuesday whom they  can  take.  The paper read by Rev. C. P.  son upon.    "Some of the Civic Needs j  of Our Community," was appreciated  by all.  To   quote  somewhat  at  length  he I  said, "The welfare, the prosperity of I  a   community,   (and   of  a   nation  as I  well)   depends    primarily     upon  the!  physical'health and strength  or   the)  individuals  who  compose  it.  Physic-1  al  soundness  in  turn  depends   upon '  the ability of all  classes  to procure  a   sufficient   supply     of     nourishing  food, and the knowledge to properly  prepare and eat it.  "Another important  factor in the  accomplishment of this result is sanitation. Carefully kept    bouses    and  , yards, proper disposal of sewage and  | waste and careful protection of  wa-  j ter   supply.  "Sickness will appear in every  community. Cases of contagious and  infectious diseases are a menace to  the whole population. Often a physician is not called until the seeds of  an epidemic are wide spread. The  employers family is endangered  through contact with domestic and  other employees. A sanitary officer  and a district nurse would do much  to lessen the danger from these  sources.  "The employment of a competent  nurse by    the    community and    the  J instruction of employees to call her  immediately without cost    to  themselves, at the first indication of sickness would  often  avert  a  neighborhood scourge of sickness and death.  I recommend to your thoughtful consideration this civic need,  and  since  the serving people of the community  are practically all colored, a competent colored nurse,   (there are many;  such  graduates     of    good     training j  schools)   would   be   of the   greatest j  benefit and might easily avert a gen- j  eral   catastrophe. j  "Cocoanut Grove has no recreation !  ground where the public can prome-|  nade;   picnic   or   rest  in   the  shade?  where   the  young  and   the  old   cat)  gather socially    and  democratically!  on  an  equal  footing    out of    woi k  hours and on holidays. A public park  (on the bay front if possible)  wc.'id  be a moral uplift for the community.  The only place for young men to con*  gregate at present  is the pool room,  the dance hall   (without any  proper  restrictions) and other equally  sirable places.  A  public park  \  not be at all impossible for this  munity if those who are abundi  able to provide it could be inter&lt;  in the matter."  Under the herd of Aesthetic.  Jackson closed his remarks wfdS  "Every public place and every hotm  might be made delightful to ih&gt;  eyes, and a bower of beauty throiUgS  the intelligent and sympathetic cooperation of citizens aided by tIJH  generous help of transforming nature."	86419376 Bytes	4887	5893	1289070347	RGB	8	600	asm04000001520093001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1475	1475	1476.jp2	/asm0400/image/1476.jp2

Harper, Chairman Libary Extension F. F. W. C.  Speaking of the season of thanks, I as civil service «reform is preferably  of the multitudinous blessings which called.    At first thought this subject  'seems  outside the  general  trend  of  bring cheer to our homes, our  neighborhoods and to our fair state,  the latest source of gratitude which  has gladdened my horizon is the  lively remembrance of Florida's recent Convention of Club Women. We  are accustomed to speak with pride  of the everwidening resources of our  wonderful country, we are learning tb  cultivate with more Intelligence our  rising crops of boys and girls, yet we'  still hesitate to view the fields of  standing grain, to consider in seriousness what sort of grown-ups we have  made half unconsciously out of ourselves.  Sixty-seven delegates from the  woman's clubs of Florida, with additional officers increasing the number to eighty, gathered at the Woman's Club House in Jacksonville about  the middle of November to report on  women's clubs, yet the steps lead  ng thereto are plain and easy to number, for . instance: She is a poor  mother who mothers just her own  children,—the heart of a true mother  goes out to the orphan, the neglected  and the unfortunate,—many such are  the wards of the state,—our public  Institutions are their only home,—  how are these homes conducted?—  what are the qualifications of these  caretakers who act in a mother's  place?—are they appointed on their  merits for the good they are able to  do to the neglected and unfortunate?  —are they?—and the next step is  the Merit System in our civil service.  Chairmen of the health' and education departments sent written reports,    tyeing unable   to be   present.  the activities of the past year and to  Eve?   with   this   disadvantage   these  mighty subjects held their rightful  1)1 ace in the fore-front of the discussions.     A year ago the president of  consult for the future. Tt has been^  said of this annual assembly that it"  includes "the most prominent, the  most intelligent and the most effective women of any community." A  census probably would have record- j  ed few of the company as Florida  born, but all are loyal, helpful daughters of the land of their present  homes. Moreover, by their independence, their self-reliance, their grasp  of essentials, their appreciation and  enjoyment of non-essentials as subordinates, by their easy unconsciousness  in using excellent natural abilities  and their willingness for service, by  all these were shown on every side  the practical sense, the freedom from  convention, the courage, the genuine  worth and the hopefulness which are  the blessed heritage of a pioneer  country. Similar assemblies in older  communities are often conducted exclusively by a few members, the inactive majority accepting without  comment the decisions of the Readers.  In   our   seventeenth   annual   conven  the General Federation mentioned  "suffrage, prohibition and politics"  as matters tabooed by the national  organization. A twelvemonth's march  of events has brought the first mentioned before several Federations in  northern states. Our chairmen on  legislation and civil service frankly  stated that many important questions  would be simplified if women had a  legal voice in their decision. The  convention smiled and the presiding  officer laughingly said "Sh!" It was  clearly the sense of the meeting that  cUffSflt progress in the rights of the  fair sex i§ sufficiently rapid to satisfy Florida. Many, conscientious  women still prefer' to wield influence  rather than authority. Perhaps because tne eternal feminine b&* had so  many centuries of experience in exercising the former.  The    publications    also    included  copies of a carefully studied booklet  tion practically all the delegates were ! presented   by   the   chairman   of   the  j women of talent.    Whatever part ap  I peared  upon  the  program,  a   dozen  j listeners were able almost equally to  ! fulfill  it.     Our ranks included sing-  | ers   who   remained   silent,   speakers  ! who listened, writers who laid aside  | their  notes,  social  leaders   who   followed, organizers who observed, with  presidents,     secretaries,     committee  heads and enthusiasts galore; the audience was replete with life, suggestion   and   decision,   yet   despite   this  wf^tlth of membership no two of us  '/Iked at once!  Again the exceptional personnel, of  ^e convention was evidenced by the  igh   character  of the  subjects   discussed.      Serious      and      important  lemes     were  none    too     heavy to  |waken interest. Matters which froir  leir personal connection or roman  fc character would seem  to appeal  fiore closely to ladies were relegated  a subordinate place.    Social conditions, legislation, civil service, pubic health, education and civics, these  Veighty and hitherto supposedly un-  jeminine subjects were the dominat-  ag topics of the discussions, recur-  |ing again and again; while interests  lportant and ably presented yet less  [(road in their scope, received an al-  3tted half hour's attention and were  |hen  passed  J)y,  as  music,  forestry,  lird protection,   traveling    libraries,  Irt collections, household economics,  flub  extension  and  the  information  lureau.    No higher compliment was  |aid to the mental,calibre of the dele-  ates than this obvious fact,-—the big-  ler   and   the   broader  an   idea,   the  |reater the interest with, which it was  eceived.  The  long patience  and  fine  course of the Chairman on social condi-  |ons was rewarded by a most sym-  athetic    hearing.    Lists    of    books  Icommendett by the National  Vigi-  Ince Committee, which furnish care-  II instruction with reference to sex,  ]ive been taken to every club home,  tie gentle manner of the chairman  legislation  misled no  one  in re-  krd  to her  clear intellect  and her  tactical  efficiency  in  presenting  to  ^islators    those humane    measures  forestry department, naming the  three hundred varieties of trees now  found in Florida.  In the reports from individual  clubs, which are the vital constituency of the Federation, over and  over sounded the same clear notes,  public health and civics, public health  and civics: Village improvement,  cleaning-up days, sanitary drinking  fountains, individual drinking cups  for rural schools, inspection of school  premises, moving picture films furnished by the State Board of Health,  playgrounds, parks, Arbor Day, tree  planting,—this last the especial enthusiasm of the civics chairman,—the  sale of Christmas seals for health  funds, libraries, the formation of  junior civic leagues, and the medical  inspection of school children in which  admirable innovation the schools of  Palatka and Ocala are leaders. It  cannot be said that club women are  learning to live • without literature,  music and art, as the local yearbooks show many fascinating programs on strictly cultural subjects  and our audiences listened intently  ,to a beautiful talk on "Venice" in  which the choice taste and varied opportunities of tfye speaker .illuminated t\\e narrative. Still practical  usefulness rather than personal culture Was the achievement which each  club proudly brought as a record of  its year's work. These reports Were  intensely interesting. The local clubs,  the personal wdrkers, are essentially  the Federation and their efforts  should never be overshadowed by any  summary'of the work according to  subjects. The presentation of these  reports promotes introduction and acquaintance among the delegates and  an earlier and more prominent place  in the anmml program should be assigned to the•'*individual'■■ societies  however many they may be. With  the close of this convention we welcomed our fiftieth club.  As the exceptional character of the  delegates determined the choice of  subjects, so also the discussion of  philanthropies attracted to our con-  vention    a. number    of _ high-m|nd  ed correspondent half humorously  challenged the reporter to make a  speech. To which he responded  somewhat as follows: When I received my first assignment to write  up a convention of ladies, the other  fellows laughed at me. They said,  "You'll catch it. AH of them will  talk at once. You can't make out  anything they are saying and they  will get after you for not taking it all  down." Anyway I tried it. The convention came to order.rather quicker  than a man's meeting. The first  speaker presented her report, short,  clear and very much to the point. So  the meeting went on, plain, clear,  fact after fact. I did not have any  trouble. When I went back to the  office, the chief said, "Cut out all the  fancy business. Boil your story down  to facts, nothing but facts." So I sat  down at the typewriter. I put down  one fact, then another and another,  I finished a page, two, three and on  up to seven. Then I took my copy  to the chief. I said, "Here's my  story, seven pages, all facts and I  am not through yet." My story went  in and since then whenever there is,  a meeting of ladies I am sent to  cover it. And I wish to say that a  convention of ladies sticks' to facts  better than an assembly of men.  Certain, it is that the women of  the Federation, having accomplished  their mission promptly and effectively, settled into the audience of the  Charities Conference to observe with  much complacency in what way prominent and capable men could do better. It was noted that a woman's  meeting is more facile, it moves more  briskly, there is less tendency to long  pauses and less punctuation consisting, of "and—er." Even an ordinarily bright woman can be trusted  to make a dash after the point.  However, in compiling generalities,  we should not forget the controlling  force of personality and the great  variety Of channels through which it  is' exercised. Needless to say that  wom^n are not blind to elegant  gowns, to beauty of person or grace  of manner and a straw ballot taken  off hand on any of these points would  have resulted in a definite and judicious choice. However, those costumes  only gained attention tvilich accentuated the qualities of the wearer.  A robe almost regal in tone and outline became attractive only when  worn with the bearing of a princess,  while a blunt disregard of the art of  the modiste coupled with a rugged individuality won a half laughing respect which was no less complimentary. As in subjects so with individuals, the good judgment of the  delegates valued talents and accomplishments at their - true worth.  Beauty of person, completeness of  type,-—and our assembly included fine  specimens of the dark-eyed southerner as well as the angel daughter of  the snows,—grace of bearing, ease of  manner, the charm of native friendliness, the heavensent gift of sympathy, none of these went unrecognized nor unrewarded by the answering pulse of appreciation.  The deference, habitual and fitting,  given to two serenely happy ladies  who were the earliest promoters of  the Federation, the comraderie of the  president and the ex-president, "the  fine spirit of friendliness and fellowship" desired by both, these were the  chief characteristics of our meetings.  Our presiding officer's unselfish wish  to prefer others, her kindliness in  serving the whole and her modest  estimate of her own powers was always evident. "So far as I have  succeeded," she suggested in conversation, "It is not by what I myself  have done, but by my ability to recognize and select those who are capable  and to enlist their services." Which  indeed, although unostentatiously  stated, is the very talent of aii organizer.  As in most assemblies of women:  members who spoke without notes  were in the minority, hardly more  than a dozen. Eminent among these  was the president of the Jacksonville  Woman's Club who adds to her execu-  I  I i  :  Ill  .3	128434596 Bytes	4997	8566	123891790	RGB	8	600	asm04000001520096001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1490	1490	1491.jp2	/asm0400/image/1491.jp2

A brave doze nof husband  sprinkled the first reception, all interested, al1 looking curiously and admiringly over into this promised land  of new and inspiring thoughts. The  program speakers were men of emi-  nece and eloquence, leaders in our  colleges and public institutions and  practical workers for social betterment. The First Florida Conference  &gt;of Charities and Correction, associated with and following our meetings, received its inspiration and  much of its support from club women. A paper written by a club woman of Jacksonville on, "The Need of  a State Board of Charities" gave the  first impetus to the undertaking. The  masterly address on "A Program for  Social Workers," the sympathetic  plea for good music in the public  schools, the winning story of helpfulness, told by a distinguished judge  of the juvenile court, all these were  records of progressive usefulness today and harbingers of hope for the  future, portions of a great drama in  which every village worker may  faithfully play his or her part.  Even the reporter,—a solitary  masculine who sat out the day sessions of our program,—was a chosen  man. References to the press were  .frequent and our versatile aifd talent-  I ***** «v(, tuiyugn yet. iviy story went  j in and since then whenever there is  and that frank honesty of manner,  almost boyish, which is ever attractive to women. In several impressive  addresses the carefully written report  preceded the impromptu explanation.  In summary, however, it should be  added that neither the gifts of nature  nor the acquisitions of matrimony  carried the strongest influence, but  rather the prevailing and all-convinc- _  ing spirit of fairness,—of willing- II  ness to concede personal plans for the  advancement of a permanent good. 8!  In the plea made by the ex-president  for the general endowment fund, she  being Field Agent for Florida,  neither strength of argument nor aptness of illustration compared in influence with her answer to objections made from the floor. With an  expressive gesture of deprecation she  rejoined, "Then let the Field Agent's  plan all go and we will begin again."  Undoubtedly every one would agree  to begin again and permanent favor  for the cause was won right there.  Buried in the mass of recent magazine articles is this sentence,:—"Self  seekers are, as a rule, opposed to  "co-operation." If there were any  self-seekers at our Federation meetings, they must have kept very quiet  on the back seats. Frank, cordial,  able and enthusiastic co-operation  was everywhere and for that reason  I write my lively recollection of  those days as first on my list of new  blessings in this season of thanks.

Glowing Account of Trip  In  Interest  of\ Federation  Mrs. J. S. Frederick, of the South-  side, has just returned from an extended trip in the interest of the  Federation of Women's Clubs of the  state of Florida, of which she is the  president, and the following glowing  report which she makes of her journey- and the work not only by every  club woman in this city, but all over  the state as well.  "It was a most satisfactory trip in  every way," said Mrs. Frederick, "as  every plan worked out smoothly.  My first stop was at Palatka, where  I was the guest of Mrs. George Gay,  president of the Woman's Club in  j Palatka. As my arrival was on Sat-  | urday, I spent the night and Sunday  with S. C. Warren and family who  own a very beautiful grove on the  St. John's river Mr. Warren is well  known to all members of the Horti-  cuture society, of which he has been  a member of many years, and he  is the inventor of several contrivances for washing and packing citrus  fruits. His enormous grove was  covered with masses of bloom and  the delicious fragrance was wafted  far out on the river. .  "Monday morning early the  launch took us down to Palatka,  where the executive board meeting  was called. An enthusiastic crowd  of seventeen ladies from the various  adjacent towns met in the parlors of j  the Putmah House at eleven o'clock,'  and at oiice 'Settled down to business.  ; "Reports from the\ chairman of  Civics, Social "Conditions, Health,  Glub extension, etc., were read and  found most interesting. Mrs. M. E.  Randall, of Lawley, had been visiting a number of towns and lecturing  to tne school children, teachers and  mothers on School Hygiene. Every-  I where she has been received with  I the greatest respect and attention.  ! "Mrs. George Gay, of Palatka, |er^tioii  chairman of Civics, has also been on  var  through Florida and lecture before  the clubs and civic associations on  (compulsory education, child labor,  and better school laws, as well as  better conditions in public institutions. The women of Florida are  awakening in a wonderful way to the  practical needs of their state, and it  is the policy of the present adminin-  tration to eliminate everything but  the most practi6al* and necessary  work.  "The meeting |)iaee for the next  iconventjion waM ^discussed but not  settled Upon. fifm William Young,  president of th« Jacksonville cluh,  and also chairmaii tif arrangements  for the General federation Convention to be held fn &ari Francisco,  i June 25 to July C reported various  routes. A private car will be furnished the Florida; delegation of  eighteen which will go from Jacksonville. ,,-,..,  I "A  preliminary,nominating   com-  II mittee consisting of Mrs. George  Gay, Mrs. M. E. ftakaall and Mrs. W.  P. Corbeti, oi Jacksonville, was appointed by the president to secure j  a satisf actmry ticket for the next November election. »AH clubs are requested to send tfeir suggestions to  this committee. ......:,  "The subject tfftiie State Flower  Was also discussed and the unanimous vote was iri favor of the orange blosom.  "A communication was read from  Los Angeles urging the Federation to  use their influence with Congress to  erect a colossal statue of Peace at  the entrance of the Panama Canal.  The board requested the president to  reply that more can be done toward  furthering the peace movement by  literature and by speakers than by  mounments.  "'The Dade City Club' and 'The  Wednesday Morning Musical Club'  of Ocala, were admitted to the Fed-  the library. A civic association had  also been started, and the ladies were  most anxious to learn of the methods of work in Florida along these  lines.  "After a delightful visit of a  week in this beautiful country I returned to Orlando, and had a most  interesting interview with the president and secretary of the Sorosis  Club of that city. This club is one  of the very best in the state, but has  never joined the Federation. Now  they have decided to investigate its  advantages and possibly become a  member of it.  Sanford was the next point reached. Here I was delightfully entertained by Mrs. Henry Wight. There  are two Federation clubs in Sanford,  "The Welaka" and "The Wednesday Club," both of which do excellent work. I was the guest of both  these clubs and had the pleasure of  renewing my friendship with Mrs.  Forest Lake, formerly the well-  known leader in Miami society. I  also exchanged greetings with Mrs.  McDaniels, sister of Mrs. C- D. Leff-  ler, of Miami, and gave accounts to  interested Sanford friends of the  well-being of the popular towns-people.  ; "Of course, while the fine gardens  surrounding Sanford excited the  greatest admiration and the charming cordiality of the people was most  attractive, I wa%glad to return to  the Magic City.  "Upon my return, I received a request from the Governor of Tennessee to act in his sub-executive committee for Florida for the Southern  Sociological Congress/'  The^ meeting of the Board    was  a tour among the various clubs, the most enthusiastic one that has  ,giV,ing them pointers on the best bee& known in the Ihistory of the  ways to help and improve their Federation, and the members ad-  towns. Mrs. Gay has secured very 3onimed with renewed enthusiasm in  reasonable terms o nthe most mod- their work.  ern trash recepticles, which she \'X then took the evening train for  urged the various clubs to purchase.

He would have  the clause amended so that the finding of the  Commission of Inquiry shall not be final, but  may be set aside by either nation.  Mr.   Roosevelt  Moves  to  Amend the Treaties.  JR. ROOSEVELT'S objections, reiterated since the beginning of the  Tripolitan war, are similar, and he  proposes several important changes.  The treaties, as drafted, would be "wicked, if  kept," and yet to break them, as undoubtedly  would be done if occasion arose, "would be  fed only less shameful than keeping them." No  &gt;ft'j joint high commission, he thinks, should be  P?j allowed to decide for us what is justiciable or  3 arbitrable. He would amend each of the  jeE   treaties along the following line:  be  toj "If either party to it claims that a dispute in-  &' volves its vital interest, its independence, or its  ie honor, then (always provided that neither party  w3| takes a position that necessitates immediate action  by the other), upon the request of either party,  all questions of fact and all questions of law involved in the dispute shall be referred to arbi  trators, who shall have no power to decide th  dispute, but shall be authorized to pass upon the  controversy as to questions of fact and of law,  and to recommend such adjustment of the dispute as they may deem just and honorable to  both the contracting nations. The recommendation of the arbitrators should then be given publicity, and, unless rejected within a specified time  by one or other of the contracting parties (in  the case of the United States this would mean  the President and the Senate, or, perhaps, the  President and Congress), should become binding  upon both."  Ex-Senator Edmunds Answers  Senator   Lodge.  &gt;j HE   question   of  the   constitutionality  i   of the treaties also continues to come  to the fore.    Senator Lodge and ex-  Secretary Olney hold that the creation   of   the   Joint   High   Commission,   with  power to determine what is and what is not  arbitrable, would be, in effect, the handing, by  the Senate, of its treaty-making powers over  to   a   commission   over   the   composition   of  which it would have no control.    Ex-Senator  £J1   Edmunds,  considered one  of the greatest of  to    our constitutional lawyers, comes to the Presi-  fro   dent's   support   on   the   constitutional   point.  ior -      - .       .  ani  ,  Its.

[•PKCIAL TFI.EOKAM TO THE PDEL1C I.EfcGEa.J  WASHINGTON, Jan. 14.—Thomas J.  Pence- who had charge of the Publicity  Bureau of the Democratic National Convention in .the last presidential election,  has recently made a tour of the Southern  States to ascertain the sentiment in the  South regarding the arbitration treaties  now pending in the Senate.  "As showing the character of the men  who are earnestly favoring the arbitration treaties," says Mr. Pence, "I may I  mention Doctor Alderman, president of  .the University of Virginia; Doctor Kirt-  l'and, president of Vanderbilt University,  in Tennessee; Doctor Craighead, of Tu-  lane University, New Orleans; Doctor  Mitchell, president of the University of  South Carolina; the Rev. Dr. J. E. White,  of Atlanta; the' Rev. Dr. Cecil Russell,  of Richmond; Clark Howell, of 'the  Atlanta Constitution; Major J. C. Hemphill, of the Charlotte Observer; Governor  Mann, of Virginia; Governor McCreary,  of Kentucky; Governor Neal, of Mississippi, and men of that character and abil-  l ity.  "The" statement ot i^ton. jonn »narp  Williams, Senator from Mississippi, in  which he carefully analyzed the treaties  and proved that they were all-sufficient  as drawn, has had a great deal to do in  the way of giving the people of the South  much information as to the scope and intent of the arbitration treaties. The fact  that opposition was found in only one city  indicates the attitude of the Southern people toward this great subject in the direction of universal peace.  "I found a great many people did not  understand what the arbitration treaties  meant and they were at a loss to explain  why Southern Senators were opposing the  treaties, but when they fully understood  the purposes and scope of thre treaties,  there was almost practical unanimity  among the people of the South w-ho read  and think, in favor of their ratification  just as they stand. The only opposition  that developed anywhere to the treaties  so far as I found was in the city of New  Orleans, and that was confined to a small  number."

Interesting    Report   of    Miss  Mildred Hamilton  j     The  Woman s  Relief    Association  i held a very interesting meeting yes-  ! terday afternoon at the home of Mrs.  P. T. Skaggs on Fourteenth Street.  |     There  were twenty-one     members  I present at the opening of the meeting, when it was called to order by  the President,  Miss Saidee Kolb.  ! .   The   minutes   of   the   last  regular  meeting  and  of the  special  meeting  were then read by the secretary, Mrs.  W. M. Brown, after which the treasurer reported the receipt of a check  for  $8.75,  the Christmas offering of  the  Knights  Templars to the Society,   a   donation   of   $40     from     the  Church of the Holy Name, $40 from^  Mrs.   Chapin,   a   winter   resident   in  Miami,   and   the   donation     of     $33  from the Housekeepers' Club at Co^  cipanut Grove, the proceeds of their  share of their Japanese^ Xeju-^Diies  from tlKfe^iiWJ^^^fb a^the^UJj^tioji  from the two   invalid chairs, which  are tnfe^ro^exty of the organization,  were   also  reported.  Mrs. Burbank, who has charge oi  he work of the visiting mirse, then  ead the following letter addressed  o the Association, the newly appointed district nurse, who was una-  Dle to be present:  "Since meeting with you on Saturday, February 3d, I have made seventeen calls where I have done actual nursing. Given at least one  bath and rubbing at each call, and  in the case of mother and child, haye  given two baths during the call.  "Have seen and talked with most  of the doctors, who seem to be greatly pleased with the prospect of help,  especially with the poor.  "Have made numerous calls in the  interest of the work where there was  no nursing involved. Have been well  received, and much interest has been  manifested by all whom I have talked to of the work, but on account  of the many demands being made  upon the public at present, have considered it wise not to solicit subscriptions towards the support of a settlement house for the visiting nurse's  headquarters. i spoke to and received the first payment on subscription of two business men, who seem-  edto approve of the plan. One gentleman, a visitor, gave $1 when I  had told him of the plan, without  being asked.  "Have made five visits where  |nursmg was involved, where there  has been no charge made, and I herewith turn in $13 earned on other  cases. Yesterday, Sunday, February  17th, I began by starting to a case  at 7:00 a. m., and after assisting  at an operation in the country near  by, in me aiternoon, came home to  bed at 9:45, having had very little  intermission during the day. I consider it my best day's work, and  wish  for  more like  it.  "Hoping that the foregoing report,  as well as the work, in a measure  represents, will meet with your ap-l  proval,  I  am,  Most sincerely and respectfully  yours in the work,  MILDRED M. HAMILTON."  Four new members were reportec  at yesterday's meeting: Mrs. S. Boot  Dean, Mrs. Walter Waldin, Mrs  Hobbs, and Mrs. Charles Courley, oi  Buena Vista.	90083308 Bytes	5071	5920	774884944	RGB	8	600	asm04000001520103001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1500	1500	1501.jp2	/asm0400/image/1501.jp2
Biography of Dr. Eberhardt (page 146)					Written on front: "146"					1910-1920			eng		University of Miami Libraries. Special Collections	Woman’s Club of Coconut Grove Records	ASM0400										asm0400000152						asm04000001520104001		The following story of the life of  )r. Eberhardt, as published in the  Jommercial Chronicle, is very in-  ,eresting:  "After all, the making of men is  the most important business of the  world; men who J$ave the divine secret of mastery o^fer whatsoever may  befall. To such men the accidents of  circumstance and environment are  but incentives and challenges to their  own courage and resources. Wise is  the man, whatever his state, who  avails himself of every means he can  discover to develop the good and useful inward forces and powers which  constitute his personality; for it is  the personal factor that lifts man into prominence and places him above  his fellows in all the relations and offices of life.  "This indefinable thing called human personality is, in a large measure, the secret of the orator's influence, the politician's triumph, the  professional man's achievements, the  business man's success.  "For nearly sixty years Dr. John  Frederick Eberhart,. A. M. LL. D.  has been a prominent figure in Illinois history, especially in Chicago  and Cook county; frsta^ a man of  great force and influence in educational affairs, and later as a successful real estate operator and home  builder. In all his line of activity  he has been an influence for good;  his work has been for the benefit of  the community and the promotion of  all worthy movements.;  "Within the scope of a brief newspaper article it is 3impossible to re  count the varied incidents of Dr.  E'berhart's career or give adequate  expression to the impress he has  made upon the history of his times;  but as he has celebrated his 83rd  birthday it seems timely and fitting  to present an epitome of his busy  and useful life; to recall in outline  those achievements by which he is  best known and most highly honored.  "Born in Mercer county, Pennsylvania, Jan. 21, 1829, Dr. Eberhart  was reared on a farm, and to him  befell the usual experiences of the  farmer's boy and country school  teacher. He became especially proficient in penmanship and drawing.  After several terms at Cottage Hill  Academy, Ellsworth, Ohio, he entered Allegheny College, Meadville, Pa.,  and was graduated in, 1853. For a  short time he was principal of the  seminary at Berlin, Somerset county, Pennsylvania, one of his pupils  being the late Dr. Hiram W. Thomas, for many years pastor of the  People's  Church,   Chicago.  ;'Dr. Eberhart came to Chicago in  1855 and for several years devoted  himself to lecturing in institutions of  learning on scientific subjects; serving as editor of the Northwestern  Home and School Journal, and traveling for a New York publishing  house. By this time he had become  widely known as an educator of exceptional ability and progressive  ideas, and 1859 he was elected superintendent of schools for Cook  county, an office which he filled with  signal success for ten years.  "Among the important achievements which will ever stand as monuments to his ability was his organization of the Cook County Normal  School, now the Chicago Teachers'  College. He was one of the founders  Of the Illinois State Teachers' Association; was instrumental in establishing township high schools and  free kindergartens; was the principal  mover in the formation of the State  Association of County Superintendents, and its first president; one of  the early members of the American  Institute of Instruction; and one of  the first life members of the National Teachers' Association. He recently donated $100,000 to his alma mater, Allegheny College, Meadville, Pa. •  "After twenty-five years spent in  pursuits connected with the cause of  education, Dr. Eberhart turned his  attention to operations in real estate, in whic'h he has been pre-eminently successful. His sons, John J.  Eberhart and Frank N. Eberhart,  &re carrying on the business established by their father. As chief promoter of Norwood Park and Chicago Lawn, Dr. Eberhart is favorably  fcnown to hundreds of home buyers.  He has handled thousands of lots and  acres in Chicago and Cook County  and made a reputation for integrity  4hd good citizenship which it would  be difficult to parallel.

The National Business League is organizing Boy Scout societies  for the purpose of planting trees on de-forested areas. Owners of  large tracts of treeless territory are asked for the use of their land  and colonies of boys under efficient instructors are sent there to  camp and, by their labor, young trees are planted and cared for.  The good results to be accomplished are manyfold. Valuable  forests are started. Waste land is put under cultivation and, best  of all, hundreds of boys are given health and knowledge and a means  of livelihood that approaches the ideal.  - A society of this kind for Dade county would be a powerful  agency for good. Tree growing in this section should be a leading  pursuit and yet, strange as it may seem, it is only accidentally or  in the establishment of fruit groves—money-makers most assuredly  —that trees are planted.  Just imagine the boys of Miami enrolled in an enthusiastic  company of scouts engaged in the converting of everybody's unused  land into forests of valuable trees! Just imagine the loafing places  about town bereft of their patrons and acres of cocoanut palms—  miles of Australian pines and gumbo limbo trees resulting from the  labor of the young woodmen.  Nor is this an impracticable thing at all. Boys must have  something on which to work off their energy, and the National  Business League, in making the opportunity for this energy to be  expended, out in the sunshine and the rain, has originated a movement that will be of untold benefit to the country.	88370520 Bytes	4928	5976	2741022240	RGB	8	600	asm04000001520105001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1502	1502	1503.jp2	/asm0400/image/1503.jp2
Notes on State flower, Cherokee rose (page 150)					Written on front: "150"; Printed on clippings: "Wants Cherokee rose for State flower"; "Cocoanut Grove ladies work for Benefit Fair"					1910-1920			eng		University of Miami Libraries. Special Collections	Woman’s Club of Coconut Grove Records	ASM0400										asm0400000152						asm04000001520106001		Wants Cherokee Rose for State Flower  /s~d  The following letter has been sent  to the nress of the state t&gt;y Mrs. Min-r  nie Moore Wilson of this city, says  the Kissimmee Gazette, -who urges  the selection of the Cherokee rose  as the state flower, and gives some  excellent reasons for her choice. In  the light of her letter, the flower  chosen seems a most happy selection.  We take pleasure in commending the  suggestion, and in calling it to the  attention of those organizations  which are interested in the subject,  says the Gainesville Sun, in a leading  editorial.     The  letter follows:  "The ever interesting subject, A  National Flower, again interests the  country, and while the Federation of  Women's Clubs is working toward  the final passage of an act of Congress that will give America a flower emblem, why cannot Florida club  women unite in one great effort to  secure for  Florida a state flower?  "The club women of the national federation are urging a petition  that will make tne white mountain  laurel the national flower. As yet,  very few legislatures have acted on  the state flower, and Florida has  long been discussing the question.  'Can Florida with her background  of romance, her history so inter-  blended with that of the Indian and  particularly the Seminole, can Florida adopt a more fitting emblem than  that of the beautiful trailing wild  rose of the South known as the  Cherokee rose? To Floridians, the  fragrant Cherokee rose has two  strong points in its favor lor its  adoption as flower emblem. It  makes possible the perfection of the  peerless Marechal Neil, which grows  in the Southland in rioutous luxury,  if budded to the studded Cherokee  stock, and like the rugged Florida  pioneer, who has blazed the way for  the luxury and comfort of the present Floridian, the native wild rose-  has made  perfect for the twentieth  century rosarian, the matchless  Marechal Neil. But a stronger argument why the Cherokee should  be the flower most worthy of honor  is its beautiful Indian legend. With  the almost universal interest and  sympathy in the Seminoles of Flor^  ida, the lengend of the Cherokee  rose will give a strong impetus toward its adoption by the Legislature  as a state flower. The present Floridian may thus pay a tribute to the.  fast vanishing race, and preserve,  too, for future generations, a native mythology in the poetic legend  of the Indian lovers.  "According to the legend, the wild  rose first grew in the Carolinas, the  home of the Eastern Cherokee Indians. Years ago, a Seminole warrior was attracted to the tribe by  the beauty of a Cherokee maiden,  whom he won, after many difficul-  tiesfi, for his bride. As she left her  childhood home for the fragrant or^  ange bower of the Seminole, she  plucked a trailing stem of the wild  rose, the flower she had always  known and loved, and, hiding it in  her bosom, she carried it to the  land of the Seminoles, which we  know as Florida. She planted; it  beside the orange tree at the door  of her husband's lodge.  "Today the beautiful white- rose  is trailing over the decaying walls  and falling timbers of the -ancient  lodge of the Seminoles. Wherever  it grows, its fragrance is wafted on  the breeze as incense to the memory of the Cherokee Indian maid. The  Seminole has done 'much for Florida in bequeathing to us the musical  and rhythmical names of rivers and  lakes; these abiding words of beauty are the heritage of these aboriginal pathfinders.  "Let us at this late day pay the  little tribute of naming a state flower in memory of the picturesque  Seminole."  * COCOANUT GROVE LADIES      *  * WORK FOR BENEFIT FAIR. *  * *  At a meeting held at Mrs. John  Gifford's, of Cocoanut Grove, yesterday afternoon, the ladies attending  worked faithfully on articles for the  Benefit Fair which is being held in  Miami today.  These ladies have some beautiful  work on display as a result of their  industry. The beautiful rosebud hat-  pins are the work of Cocoanut Grove  (amateurs. The paper hat bags, decorated with cocoanut leaves are the  work of Mrs. Wade, an artist.	87412264 Bytes	4903	5941	442487122	RGB	8	600	asm04000001520106001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1503	1503	1504.jp2	/asm0400/image/1504.jp2

MUSIC MATTERS  WAS FEATURE OF  NIGHT MEETING  Large and Enthusiastic Audience Attended Evening Session of Federation of Women's Clubs.  FINE PROGRAM WAS RENDERED  Dr.  Conradi  Delivered Address on  Subject of Music In the  Public Schools.  The open meeting of the Florida Federation of Women's clubs held last evening in the Woman's club was attended  by a large, enthusiastic and highly appreciative audience, composed not only  of many prominent citizens and club  women of Jacksonville and delegates to  the convention, but more especially lovers of good music, for this program of  music was rendered by artists of no  mean ability.  At the meeting of the Federation held  in Ocala last year a new department was  opened in the club work, that of music.  Mrs. Arnold Goldy of St. Augustine, a  prominent member of the St. Cecelia  club who has also been connected with  the1 work of the State Musical Association, was appointed chairman of the committee in charge of this department. Mrs.  Goldy has worked untiringly and much  has been accomplished during the past  twelve months. She secured the services  of Dr. Conradi, president of the Florida  State College for Women in Tallahassee  who spoke last evening on the introduc-  i tion  of music   in  the  public   schools.  The musical program which was arranged by Mrs. Goldy, was rendered by  Miss Clara Farrington, violinist, and  Miss Ella Scoble Opperman, pianist,  members of the faculty in the musks department of the State College for Women. These young women are among the  most talented musicians in the South,  and their numbers were most heartily  applauded.  PLAYED AT CONCERT.  Miss Farrington appeared in Jacksonville two years ago, playing at a concert  given by the State Music Association in  the board of trade auditorium. She completely captivated her audience, and there  were present at the entertainment last  evening several who had enjoyed the privilege of hearing her play two years ago  who took advantage of this opportunity  to enjoy her rendition of several numbers. Possessed of a charming personality,  and  artistic  temperament,   she  gave  inmost  pleasing  renditions  of   several  dif-  j ficult selections.  Miss Opperman is a pianist of no mean  ability,  and in  her numbers displayed a  rare    understanding   and    interpretation  her  technique  being especially  fine.   She  is graceful and attractive  in personality  and   was   most   cordially    received    last-  night,    her    audience     being     composed  of    many     musicians,      naturally     critical. Her       accompaniments       were  ably   executed   and   most   pleasing.  MUSICAL  NUMBERS.  The musical numbers were as follows:  (a) Adagio Religioso (from Fourth Con-~  certo),   Vieuxtemus;   (b)   Spanish   Dance  No.   8,   Sarasate,   Clara   Farrington.  (a)   Etude  Op.   72,   No.   6,   Moszkowski-  (b)  Minuetto  Op.  €8,  No.  2,  Moszkowski,'-  Ella Scoble Opperman.  (a) Chanson sans Paroles. Tschaikows-  ki;  (b)  Moise (Theme  and Variations on  the G string only), Paganini, Clara Far- -  rington.  Hungarian Rhapsody, No. 12, Liszt, Ena  Scoble Opperman.  In introducing the speaker of the §  evening, Mrs. Charles Cay, president  of the Woman's club of Tallahassee,  paid a glowing tribute to this prominent educator, Dr. Edward Conradi,  president of the State College for  Women  of Tallahassee.  MUSIC   IN   PUBLIC   SCHOOLS.  Dr.   Conradi's   subject   was  Music In f  the   Public   Schools.(     Two   years   ago  the   State   Music   Association   took   up  the   subject,   and   members   have   been  endeavoring   to   interest   all   clubs   in j  this   work.     Last   year   the   Woman's  clubs  became  interested,   and  to  stim-  \ ulate   enthusiasm   in   the   subject,   Dr.  Conradi   was   asked   to   speak   at   the  meeting last night.  Dr. Conradi's remarks were in answer to the question, has music any  place in the school curriculum, and if  so, what are the reasons for its introduction? He said in part: "It is  an established fact that business men  readily contribute to anything from  which they are sure benefits will be  derived, and to secure their cooperation in this movement it is only necessary to prove the need of music in the  public schools, and what can be accomplished by its introduction." Attention was called to the fact that all  the senses are fed freely, all but the  auditory sensory. From the lowest  grades the visual sensory is trained,  and feasted on unlimited material.  FUNDAMENTAL METHOD.  Music is a fundamental method in  cultivating emotion and in the expression of emotions. Dr. Conradi interspersed his talk with many illustrations which substantiate his claim  that music is the greatest thing in the  uplift of the soul, in the old as well as  young. He said, "Songs stand for  character and emotiOnai uplift as  nothing else will." He made an urgent  plea for concentrated effort on the  part of the women of the state to obtain the introduction of a systematic  study of music in the public schools.  ; Dr. Conradi is a direct, convincing, and  •interesting speaker, and offered many  suggestions and arguments which can  be used to advantage by the women in  their effort to secure the introduction  of music in the public schools of Florida.	85805448 Bytes	4872	5869	3064150847	RGB	8	600	asm04000001520108001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1506	1506	1507.jp2	/asm0400/image/1507.jp2

The roll call of officers, first of the  program, showed that all were present,  with the exception of Mrs. S. J. Hil-  frurn, of Palatka, who is State auditor  of the federation.  i T£e report of the president, Mrs. A.  E. Frederick, of Miami, was very interesting and showed in a marked manner the profound interest she has taken  in her duties, and the many accomplishments which have rewarded the  work of the entire federation since tire  last annual meeting. Mrs. Frederick  was high in praise in speaking of the  w Oman's Club of this city regarding  the preparations it has made for the  entertainment of the delegates to the  meeting, and said that the interest  ^ch has been shown was in keeping  with the general spirit of enterprise  and hospitality so evident in the mem-  °ers of the local organization.  Directors Are Pr*     _.„  The president attributed the good  work accomplished during the year  largely to the help of her board of directors and to the chairman and various committees. Her board of direc-J  tors has been wisely chosen and had  rendered her much aid and profitable  advice on many matters during the  year. She took in many mutters of  general interest to all of the members  among which is the fact that she has  written 765 letters during the year to  the various organizations making up  the federation. She spoke of the great  growth and stated that each had lent a  helping hand in the work of good.  Corresponding Secretary's Report.  Mrs. William Hocker, of Ocala, first  vice president, read the report of the  corresponding secretary, wno is absent  from the meeting. The report told of  the enthusiasm that existed through-J  out the entire State among the mem-"'1  bers and in the different clubs, who  by letters made known their endeavors and told of the work most important in the consideration of each of  the represented bodies. The report  stated that 500 letters had been written throughout the State in an endeavor to keep in touch with all the clubs  and that the replies received were  gratifying in the extreme.  Treasurer's   Report.  Mrs. F. F. Tenny, of Federal Point,  who looks after the finances of the  organization, and takes upon her  shoulders the responsibility of steering through any financial difficulties  which may rise, made her report, taking in every detail, both of expenditures and funds received during, the  past year. The report showed the  financial condition of the federation to  be very favorable, considering the numerous expenditures, which were necessary to carry out the worthy plan of  the  body.  Mrs.   S.   J.   Hilburn,   auditor   of   the  federation,   reported   the   books   to   be  in   first-class      shape,     after     having  passed  inspection  at  her  hands.  Mother of Federation.  Applause greeted Mrs. E. G. G.  Munsell, of Green Cove Springs, who  bears the well-earned title of "the  mother of the federation." It is stated  that it is very largely due to her untiring efforts that the federation had  reached its present high standard, and  that she has .ever been a great power  in keeping the fire of keen interest  glowing in the hearts of many members through Florida. Her report of  the general federation was brief, and  to the point, showing that uhe was actively in touch with the duties of her  office.  Mrs. Kirk Munroe, of Cocoanut  Grove, who, besides being chairman of  the forestry committee, is press representative, reported upon the work  accomplished as correspondent to local press. Her remarks were very  witty, and brought much laughter,  when she showed what had been accomplished by exhibiting many clippings. She spoke of the great help  rendered by the press, and stated that  newspaper notices had been used with  great advantage in stimulating and  arousing interest in the work. She  stated that she desired the help of all  the clubs, and suggested that each appoint reporters to keep her supplied  with good reading matter. She spoke  of the many letters which she had  written in the endeavor to more fully  accomplish   her   task.  1£AlI1  Club Extension  Report.       %  Mrs. J. A. Crosby then made her report on the extension of clubs  throughout the State. She leads the  work of her efficient committee in establishing new organizations, and adding to the large number of clubs represented in the federation. She reported the forming of ten new clubs during the past year, and the statements  were greeted with hearty demonstrations of approval.  Library Extension,  As chairman of the library extension committee, ^the report of Mrs.  Charles T. Harper was most interesting. She described the rather original  plan by which little libraries of good  books were circulated from city to city  through the central and southern part  of the State, especially where there  are no free libraries. There are a  number of these libraries now in circulation. The library is composed of  about eighty boo&s, on subjects in  general, both interesting and instructive. These are sent in chests made  for the purpose to different sections,  where they are received by a librarian,  who, by letting out the books or by-  other means, makes up the money to  pay the express. All money above expenses may be used as the local club  sees fit.  The Official Organ.  Mrs. T. E., Buck, of this city, made  her report of the official organ, The  Keystone, which is a paper published  in the interest of the work of the women. She stated that all should read  and subscribe to the paper, as a means  of keeping in touch with the work of  the federation. Mrs. Munroe suggested that the bulletin be also largely  recognized in the matter of contribution.  The report of Mrs. E. E. Coulson, the  chairman of the committee on bird protection, was deferred for the present,  owing to the fact that it Was still in  the hands of a stenographer.  Mrs. Frank Roger's report as chairman of the committee on reciprocity  was next'on the program.  General Federation Benefits.  The time was then taken up by the  reception of federal greetings from  other organizations. Each organization  present told of the benefits derived  from the general federation, which  showed that the women of this State  kept in constant touch with similar  work done  throughout the  country.  The report of the credential committee was not quite complete, but a favorable communication is expected at  another   meeting.  The session adjourned at about 12  o'clock, having accomplished admirably  the business of the opening meeting,  which is strenuous. The federation  went into session again at 2:30 this  afternoon to take up the following outline   of   business:  Reading  of the minutes.  Announcements.  Report of committee on rules and  regulations.  Report of chairman of civic committee, Mrs. George Gay.  Report    of    chairman    of household  economics committee, Mrs. L. V. Duval.

Dear Madam:  I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the End  instant and to say in reply that the sanitary condition of Cocoanut  Grove is in a general way just like a great many other little towns  in Florida that have not been incorporated.     There are a certain  number of things, however, that the Woman's Clubs and Housekeeper's  Clubs can do.  These have been near-indicated in an address before  the State Federation of Women's Clubs in Jacksonville, a copy of  which address is herewith sent you.  Disposal of sewage has also been dealt with in a special  publication of the .board, a copy of which is sent you under separate  cover.  We have two kinds of nuisances: One that actually makes  people sick, which comes under the jurisdiction of the State Board  of Health, the law concerning which will be found on the attached  leaflet; the other kind is the common nuisance and does not make  people sick.  That is dealt with by Section 3680 of the General  Statutes of Florida and reads as follows:	106384516 Bytes	5261	6739	2918804407	RGB	8	600	asm04000001520113011.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1526	1526	1527.jp2	/asm0400/image/1527.jp2

BY  • WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT  (REPORTED BY WILLIAM  BAYARD HALE)  Q  IT was an autumn day at Beverly-by-  the-Sea. The cold wind that swept  up the hill made the log that crackled  in the study fire-place a pleasure to  the eye and a comfort to the hack.  The last detail of a long journey through  twenty-four states of the Union, to be entered  upon on the morrow, was completed. A  last official act — the exchanging of adieux  with the late ambassador of Japan, just  called home to become his Emperor s Minister of Foreign Affairs — was over. A  loyal delegation of New England's business  men had come, offered their stirrup-cup  of cheer, and departed, and the President  had an hour all his own. He sat back in  his chair, and talked — talked of a thing  that lies perhaps nearer his heart than  anything else in the world — talked of peace  on earth among the nations of the earth, and  the prospect of it. The sun was going down  in a particularly fine exhibition of its best  colors.  When a President relaxes before his  study fire late on a fine autumn afternoon,  he is pretty certain to say something interesting. Mr. Taft said a great many things  interesting. Some of them discretion scarcely suggests the advisability of printing.  But some other things which the President  said so manifestly ought to be printed —  ought to be heard not by a solitary listener  but by the nation and the world, both on  account of their intrinsic interest and of  their significance coming from the occupant  of so exalted an office — that I asked permission to write them out. And obtained  it, with the qualification that I should make  it clear I was recording an unpremeditated,  informal conversation.  Thus, then, the President, to the best of  his interlocutor s recollection:  Do you know that one of the most  notable phenomena of the day is the swiftness with which belief in permanent international peace is growing?  Yes, this sentiment, comparatively new  in the world, has made enormous strides  within the past few years. Wherever  1 go 1 find the most eager interest in  anything 1 say on the subject of war and  peace. Crowds grow silent as I approach  that theme; men put a hand behind the  ear and stand on tiptoe leaning forward so  as not to miss a word. There is astir a  profound revolution in the popular thought  on the subject of war, a moral awakening  to the hideous wickedness of armed combat  between man and man, and an economic  perception of the wastefulness and folly  not only of war but of the great armaments  which the present jealousy of the Powers  makes it necessary to maintain.  Workingmen have brought it home to  me as 1 have seen and talked with them  in all parts of the country that they are  against war. They have to pay the bills,  and what do they gain? What interest  have they in the common run of disputes  between governments — matters of boundary, matters of dynasty, matters of so-  called "honor"? And if they feel any  interest in the dispute, they want to know  why it can't be settled in some way less  archaic,   less   barbarous,   less   wasteful,	64509976 Bytes	3919	5485	1949064962	RGB	8	600	asm04000001520115011.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1530	1530	1531.jp2	/asm0400/image/1531.jp2

It is indeed a barbarous thing, a thing  worthy of the Stone Age, that men with  common interests, a common destiny,  with all the great common causes, common  battles to fight against nature, common  marches to make up the ascent of civilization — a barbarous thing that men  should cease from their common war to  engage in mutual slaughter and destruction, should batter and disfigure and maim  and   slay  one  another.  With this feeling in the mind of the  workingman, war to-day does not afford  the glittering prospects it once did. It  is, for instance, no longer advisable to  resort to conflict with another country  as a means of reuniting a country distracted by internal problems. On the  contrary, war is distinctly dangerous to  a country torn by internal dissensions.  The increased burden of taxation, the  tightness of money, the inconvenience of  living, the unpopularity of war, the  absence of troops, abnormal conditions  generally, and especially the vivid realization that the interests of the rulers  are not the interests of the people — these  things are likely to provoke and encourage  domestic disaffection.  The birth and growth of this peace  sentiment (and I tell you it is acquiring  amazing strength) is not to be wondered  at; it would have been a cause of wonder if  it had not been born. We have advanced  in everything else; we have lagged far  behind in this serious and terrible matter  of international disputes, allowing them  to settle themselves according to the rude  and savage methods of days long past.  Now we have at last taken up that matter,  I am inclined to think that we shall  advance with it much more swiftly than  some   will   believe.  The evening papers on the table had  cables from Peking telling of the gravity  of the insurrection in a Chinese province;  cables from Paris, Berlin, and Rome agreeing in pessimistic views of the outcome of  the European crisis. But the President  talked on — of permanent peace among the  nations.  I say boldly that what I look forward  to is nothing less than a court of the  nations — an Areopagitic court, to whose  conscientious and impartial judgment peoples shall submit their disputes, to be  decided according to the eternal principles of law and equity.  Civilization demands that, and it is  coming. The treaties with Great Britain  and France lately negotiated, will, if  ratified by the Senate, mark a long step  into the path along which the world must  now advance.  Everyone recognizes that our existing  treaties with England and France — which  agree to arbitrate all questions except  those which affect the vital interests or  the national honor of the Powers concerned  — make an advance in international  relations. Yet, of course, when any  question comes up, either nation might  convince itself that its vital interests  or its national honor were involved, and  refuse to arbitrate. There are very few  questions which might not be so construed  in the opinion of one or the other nation.  I mean to say that the exception in the  present treaties is so phrased that it  really leaves very little to be arbitrated;  it leaves us definitely committed to very  little indeed. In effect, we merely declare that we are in favor of arbitration,  and that, when a question arises which  we are willing to arbitrate, we will arbitrate it — if the other nation also is  willing.  Now, that is all very well — but it  doesn't go very far toward permanent  peace — toward providing a means for  the settling of those serious questions  which  lead   to  wars.  The new treaties do provide that means;  the new treaties do really commit us,  and the nations which sign with us, to  seek a settlement of all disputes, even  the most serious, without armed conflict.  The new treaties do not leave it to the  excited, momentary opinion of the countries involved to decide whether or not  the question which has arisen is one that  may honorably be arbitrated. The new  treaties provide a judicial means of  settling that initial question.

This device of the Joint High Commission is the centre and the point of the  whole plan. I repeat there is nothing  gained for the cause of peace by agreeing  to arbitrate what and when we feel inclined. There is everything gained for  it by agreeing to arbitrate whatever  an impartial tribunal says is arbitrable.  These treaties establish such a tribunal;  under the plan it will always be constituted  of an equal number of citizens of the  United States and of the other country  involved — three of each. It is a mistake  to say that the Joint High Commission  might be made up of foreigners. That  could not possibly be; there must always  be in it three American citizens and three  citizens or subjects of the other nation;  and unless five of the  six agree that the  issue is an international one which  may be settled by  the just application  of the principles of  law and equity in  which the whole civilized world agree —  arbitration may not  be had. If five of  the six members  agree that it is capable of just settlement  by the impartial  principles of law and  equity, then the Executive and the Senate are bound to take  the steps necessary to submit the question  to a board of arbitration.  We should not be forced to arbitrate  anything, and, of course, on the other  hand, we should not be able to secure  arbitration for anything, unless two of  our own three members agree on it.  The treaties themselves naturally do  not state how the members of the Joint  High Commission are to be selected.  Each nation will name them as it sees  fit. The Senate can, if it like, reserve  to itself the right to confirm nominations  made by the President. I see no objection to that.  IN   BALTIMORE  ON  MAY  3,   191 I  PRESIDENT TAFT, THE OFFICIAL HEAD OF THE ARMY  AND NAVY, AND SECRETARY OF WAR DICKINSON  ARRIVING  AT THE   PEACE   CONFERENCE  There is another feature which has  not been appreciated as much as it deserves. In the first place, under these  treaties, before we come to actual arbitration or even to reference to the Joint  High Commission for a decision as to  whether arbitration is or is not to be had,  it is provided that either party to a dispute may postpone action for one year,  in order to afford an opportunity for  diplomatic discussion and adjustment.  Now, that year's delay would prevent  almost any possible war. Wars almost  invariably spring from the swift passions  of a moment. Almost invariably governments are hurried into some belligerent act by the sudden passion of a  people aroused by an accident, a misunderstanding, or an error, which a few  days' delay would cure, and a few months'  time would erase  from the memory.  The necessity for a  very little delay, the  making it impossible  for two Powers to  rush into hostilities,  would remove far  more than half the  peril of war.  Objection has been  made, you know,  that the ratification  of these treaties  would obligate us to  submit to outsiders  questions so vital as,  for instance, the restriction of immigration,  the Monroe Doctrine, and the payment of  Confederate bonds. Senator Root has  proposed to put into the resolution ratifying the treaties a qualification to the  effect that they do not authorize the  submission to arbitration of "any questions which depend upon or involve the  maintenance of the traditional attitude  of the United States concerning American  questions or other purely Governmental  policy."  Senator Root's resolution does no harm,  but the subjects which it excepts from  those which may be arbitrated were never  among them.

These are all domestic matters, matters  of internal policy, which no other power  could   bring  into   question.  What is the good of such a qualification?  It is already implicit in the treaties as  they stand. All of us in our daily lives  are fully subject to the courts of the land.  We are responsible for our every act,  and we may be haled before the court  viding that we shall be free to restrict  immigration and to enforce the Monroe  Doctrine. Those are national matters  — not international. They would never  be arbitrated, Root resolution or no Root  resolution. As to immigration^there can't  be an instant's doubt that it is a purely  domestic matter. As to the Monroe  Doctrine, I believe that the study of that  subject will demonstrate that it, too, is  by all the world recognized and accepted  as a settled national policy of the United  Copyright by Underwood & Underwood  THE    PRESIDENT   ON   HIS    FAVORITE    SUBJECT  "CROWDS   GROW   SILENT  AS   I   APPROACH   THAT THEME ;   MEN   PUT  A   HAND   BEHIND  THE   EAR  AND   STAND  ON   TIP-TOE   LEANING   FORWARD   SO   AS  NOT  TO  MISS   A   WORD"  and our acts questioned, and the decision  of the court pronounced. Yet people  do not worry lest they have to submit  to the judge the internal conduct of their  own households. They don't deem it necessary to draft a bill of rights guaranteeing  that a man shall be secure in his inalienable privilege of marrying either a blonde  or a brunette as his taste and the opinions  of the girls decide. That would be no  more absurd than is the amendment pro-  States. A policy which has been continually adhered to for a century, publicly  and in the eyes and ears of the whole  world, without challenge by any Power,  has ceased to be open to question.

While I am expressing my own views,  I may as well say that personally I would  go further than these treaties go in the  matter of deciding what questions are  justiceable. I should be willing to leave  the question of whether or not an issue  arising between two nations is arbitrable  to the decision — not of a Joint High  Commission whose finding is practically  controlled by a majority of our own representatives upon it — but of the Board  of Arbitration itself, which is ultimately  Now, those who object to these treaties  in their hearts object to any arbitration;  that is all there is about it.

It won't do  to say we believe in arbitration, and then  refuse to arbitrate anything but minor  questions about which we care nothing,  which we are certain of winning, or  which we are willing to lose. You can't  have a court on such terms. You can't  enforce international law and equity  over the affairs of nations by playing fast  and loose like that. It is no good talking  about the grand principle of international  arbitration — and then excepting from  the application of that principle all that  makes it of any  significance.  Of course, a man who in his heart of  hearts believes in war and likes it, who is  convinced that it is a noble game, strengthening the body and elevating the soul —  of course, that man can not be expected  to support real arbitration treaties. There  are those who were born with this spirit  in their breast and who probably do  sincerely regard as invertebrate milksops us who are opposed to war.

Some of us so hate  war, while we so love the peace of right  eousness, that we are willing to submit  all our disputes to disinterested judges.

He urged this: The condition of national prosperity is national  strength, and a nation that is not politically (i.e., militarily) strong must play  a secondary and effaced role in the affairs  of the world; must live on the sufferance  and good will of others, unable to make its  due weight felt in the councils of nations,  or ensure respect for its legitimate interests; and, when it comes to the pinch,  be shouldered out by the more lusty.  "When a people will not or cannot continue to spend enough on its armaments  to be able to make its way (sich durch-  lusetien) in the world, then it falls back  into the second rank and sinks down to  the role of super on the world's stage.  There will always be another and stronger  which is ready to take its place."  Even more concretely was this view  expressed more than a decade since by  the German delegate to the first Hague  Peace Conference, Baron Karl Von Stengel.    This authority says in his book that:  predominance, the struggle for which is now  in progress between Great Britain and Germany. Such predominance forces a nation to  seek markets and, where possible, control them  to its own advantage by predonderant force.  There you have it quite clearly from  the greatest Anglo-Saxon exponent of  the old political creed. The naval rivalry between Great Britain and Germany  is part of that struggle for commercial and  industrial predominance which is going  on between two countries, and moreover  the Mahans, von Stengels, Homer, Leas,  and Roosevelts defend these "axioms"  by what is presumed to be a very profound philosophy. It is all, we are told, in  keeping with the great laws of life in the  world — with all that we know of the  evolutionary process; throughout nature,  the law of fight and struggle is supreme;  so must it be with nations.  Well, it's all wrong. It considers only  one half of the facts, and the other half,  perhaps the larger, certainly the dominating half in the general process of human  development, is left out. And the evolutionary analogy at which I have hinted,  and which is accepted almost universally  as a true analogy, is an absolutely false	38636992 Bytes	3924	3280	1202442759	RGB	8	600	asm04000001520115081.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1537	1537	1538.jp2	/asm0400/image/1538.jp2

PATTEN  (AUTHOR OF " THE NEW BASIS OF CIVILIZATION ")  IF ONE watches from day to day the  statements of newspapers, or estimates the expenditures made on  national armaments, he is inclined  to the view that the world has not  changed, that the passions of men are as  strong as ever, and that wars will always  remain objects of dread and a menace to  social progress. The reasoning back of  this view is often stated, and has become  so familiar that it is a part of our historical heritage. The opposing view is  seldom clearly expressed, and seems to  lack force because there is no emotional  background to give it vividness. I have  no desire to imply that the older view has  no validity." The arguments for it are  plain and clear. What I wish to impress  is that we are in an age of transition in  which the new and the old exist side by  side, and thus are confused. The new is  steadily coming more clearly into view,  while the old yields but slowly because it  is made vivid by tradition and emotion.  This contrast is made more vivid when  we realize the radical difference between  the appeal which war and peace make to  us. The appeal of war comes through our  emotions and national traditions. The  nearer we can put ourselves in the attitude  of primitive men in a fierce struggle for  local advantage, the more clearly does the  proposition of nations come out, and the  more vivid is the appeal that war  makes.  Religion, race, language, and local advantage have given the basis of past  conflicts, and have separated men into  opposing groups, which struggled in hopeless endeavors to suppress each other.  These antagonisms have not ceased, but  they have lost their force as means of  arousing modern nations, because the  grouping of nations, now necessary to  carry on a successful war, must extend  over such large areas that men of opposing  religions, races, and languages must be on  the same side. An emotional, local war  is now impossible, for it would be quickly  suppressed by the larger nations whose  interests  are  jeopardized.  Emotion is intense only as it is local  and vivid. It has no means of propagating itself except by personal contact. A  large assembly might be emotionally  aroused, but the extreme limit of such an  assembly would be five thousand persons.  Fifty million people could not be aroused  by any such means. As a result, the  orator is displaced by the editor; for only  books and papers can reach so large a number located in so many places and living  under such different conditions. I do not  mean to imply that editors and authors  are better than orators, but their actions  are conditioned by the medium they use.  Successful papers must appeal to a large  audience, and hence local appeals fail to  arouse, or more often arouse antagonisms  that destroy the paper's influence. There  is, therefore, a constant tendency to appeal  to broader motives, and to base the appeal  on statistical and historical evidence that  has but slight emotional value. Orators appeal to passions, while editors  appeal to facts. This states concisely a  notable difference between the means  used by these two dominant social forces.  The change from listening to reading  carries with it a change from local intense  appeals to those that are general and mild.  Larger areas are thus united and a check  is put upon local antagonisms and upheavals.	65480116 Bytes	3942	5535	2617704146	RGB	8	600	asm04000001520116011.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1538	1538	1539.jp2	/asm0400/image/1539.jp2
World's peace in the making (back)		Patten, Simon N. (Simon Nelson), 1852-1922			Article, "The world's peace in the making" written by Simon N. Patten found in the scrapbook		Leaflets			1910-1920			eng		University of Miami Libraries. Special Collections	Woman’s Club of Coconut Grove Records	ASM0400										asm0400000152						asm04000001520116021		(  This change is made emphatic by like  alterations brought about by commerce  and industry. The food of our ancestors  was raised on their farms, their clothing  was made in their homes, and their houses  and tools had a local origin. Each community was thus locally independent,  and did not feel the evils that befell other  communities or nations. War stood for  the conquest of the stranger and the appropriation of his goods. Ancient wars had  plunder as their end — your neighbor's  prosperity was thus your temptation and  his loss brought home to you no felt evil.  Modern industry has changed all this.  The stoppage of commerce means the  oss of customary articles from your table  and a failure, on your part, to dispose of  some of the articles you have produced.  War thus means conscious deprivation to  all in industrial contact with the warring  nations. The losses are not confined to  those engaged in it, but are felt by the  whole world. The capital destroyed is  taken from the world's market, and the  labor displaced is felt by every industrial  worker. The evil most dreaded by workmen is unemployment, and this is one of  the most readily perceived results of great  wars. First war, then industrial depression, and then a lack of work and  decreased wages is a sequence so obvious  that even the dullest worker can comprehend.  It is, therefore, no wonder that 250,000  workmen assembled in Berlin to protest  against a recent menace of war. To them,  war would mean a burden with no compensation in glory. Lower wages, less  work, and a lower standard of life could be  the only result of a clash of arms. Facing  these evils, how could the workmen of  Berlin do other than they did? It is  also important to note that for once the  interests of capitalists and laborers in  Germany became identical. The financiers opposed war with the same vigor  as did the socialists, thus showing the  fundamental unity of the social parties  which, on minor matters, oppose each other  so bitterly. The great gain of socialism  is that it has made workmen calculate  what is for their advantage. An economic viewpoint has disadvantages, in that  it prompts people to be over-zealous for  their economic rights, but it sweeps away  the emotional background that has controlled the world for ages. No calculating man wants to fight. The very things  that seemed on the credit side of war,  thus become its greatest debits. Glory  becomes misery when it is represented by  a column of figures. To both capitalist  and laborer this is becoming plain, with  the result that their united forces will  oppose war.  Calculation and emotion are the great  forces that determine history. Emotion  is local and intense, and has its maximum  effect in private life. It loses force as the  size of social units grows. Public matters  must, thus, become matters of calculation  in which emotion plays a subordinate part.  The distant evil makes itself felt, not on  our emotions, but in dollars and cents, in  poorer meals and less work. These are  the forces that oppose war, and their  growing control over our conscious acts  means the repression of the emotional  outbursts that lead to war. The growth  of commerce, the increase of capital, the  rise in the standard of life, the greater  use of magazines and papers, the spread  of art and literature — all augment the  forces of peace and increase the difficulty  of arousing the warlike feelings that  wrought such havoc in the past.  , War has not gone from us, but its forces  are held in check by the interests and  sentiments of modern industry. It will  go when men live in the present and let  their present contact with other men  govern their acts. War is within us —  made active by tradition and emotion.  Peace is without — and has its bases in  the harmony of interests and the welfare  of mankind. Slowly but surely, economic  interests dominate the emotions, and the  growth of nations unites men of different  faith, emotion, and education into one  social unit. The larger the nation, and  the higher the standard of life, the more do  the forces of peace dominate. We may  not live to see the day when war is no more,  but we may be sure that each decade will  strengthen economic interests and put  conciliation in the place of struggle as a  means of national advance.  ■  Y  !

Special Collections	Woman’s Club of Coconut Grove Records	ASM0400										asm0400000152						asm04000001520120041		FOREWORD  At the Tenth Biennial Convention of the General Federation of  Women's Clubs, held in Cincinnati in June of 1910, Mrs. Ellen  Spencer Mussey, then Chairman of the Legislation Department, mentioned the request that had come to her from many sources, for a  primer for legislative work. She added that there should be a manual  published for each State, giving the laws most concerned with women  and children. This suggestion, along with others akin to it, crystallized into the adoption by the Convention, of a resolution providing for  the preparation of a series of State Digests presenting the laws of most  interest to women. It is in pursuance of this plan that the Legislation Committee of the Florida Federation of Women's Clubs is offering this little pamphlet for the consideration of the thinking women of  the State. If we are to have any influence at all in bringing about  such reform as may come through changes in legislation, there are three  necessary conditions to be observed, viz;  (a) A thorough understanding of arguments AGAINST as well as  in favor of the measures we are asked to advocate.  (b) Concerted action on the part of the federated clubs, in the  furtherance of plans.  (c) Official endorsement of measures by the State Federation.  Without any one of these requisites, your committee is so handicapped as to be worse than useless. It is with the hope that the club women  of Florida may be brought to realize how very many lines of Federation activity lead directly to legislative reform, that we are offering the  following summaries; with the suggested outlines for club study. If we are  to make any gains through legislation in 1913, this year of 1911-1912  must be a period of education along the lines we wish to pursue, and  we must be prepared before our next Federation meeting, to present  and act upon carefully prepared plans of work. We are not denied the  right of petition which is withheld from our British sisters, and there  doubtless are times when a numerously signed petition may have excellent effect as an expression of sentiment or conviction on the part of  a community. There is also a time and place for the personal letter to  representatives, provided it expresses vital interest and firm belief, and  is not merely a few perfunctory lines dictated by some organization.  The real power that brings things to pass is not measured by  yards   of petition, nor numbered by hundreds of letters—it lies in the	53012066 Bytes	3439	5136	1224611152	RGB	8	600	asm04000001520120041.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1560	1560	1561.jp2	/asm0400/image/1561.jp2

The thorough awakening of a social consciousness, the confluence  of a strong current of public opinion are not matters to result from  the work of a few months, or even years, but we must not withhold  such effort as we have in our power to give. Let us be prepared, before the Legislative Session of 1913, to give unbiased intelligent support to such movements as are for the improvement of conditions in  our beautiful State, working for these because we have investigated and  know not only that they are right, but that they are expedient for us.  The little outlines for study are suggestive merely, and may be  changed and elaborated to any extent that local circumstances warrant.  We do urge the clubs to use them, however, co-operating with the Federation Committees, asking assistance from the chairmen of the respective departments, and getting information from whatever source they  may be able to obtain it accurately. We hope that through its president, each federated club in our State may be able to submit recommendations next fall, which the Legislation Committee may formulate  into plans to be presented to the Convention in 1912.

This property is not subject to the  debts of the husband. He is entitled to the custody, control and  management of the wife's separate property, but cannot encumber it, nor create any lien upon it, without the consent and signature of the wife, nor can he charge her estate without her consent.  A wife may not convey her separate property without her  husband's consent, except choses in action assigned by husband  to wife, and assigns, which are assignable by her alone.  A wife's separate property cannot be levied upon for family  necessities ordered by her.  The law gives the husband the care of a wife's property, and  he may collect rents, using them as he pleases. She cannot sue  him for rents or profits, but if he abuses his privilege, she may  have a trustee appointed in his place.  A wife is entitled to a dower interest in all real property acquired by her husband, and he cannot convey a perfect title to it,  unless she relinquishes her dower in the manner prescribed by  law. The wife is also entitled to a dower interest in all personal  property of which her husband dies possessed.  The dower interest of a widow is in all cases, a life estate in  one third of the real estate of which the husband dies seized, or  of which the husband has been seized during coverture and of  which the wife has not by legal conveyance relinquished her  dower.  Of the personal property, her dower interest is one-half of  which he is possessed at the time of his death, if there be no  children, or if there be only one child. If there be more than one  child the dower interest in the personalty in one-third. This  dower interest is free in every way from the claims of creditors.  In all cases, the widow may take her choice between her dower,  and what is known in law as "a child's part" of her husband's estate. This option must be exercised within one year after appointment of an administrator, or the probate of the will as the  case may be. If the widow elects not to take dower and there  are no children, she then takes his entire real and personal estate,     f there is one  child, she takes  one-half; if there be  two	51581036 Bytes	3383	5080	3179459240	RGB	8	600	asm04000001520120061.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1562	1562	1563.jp2	/asm0400/image/1563.jp2

Special Collections	Woman’s Club of Coconut Grove Records	ASM0400										asm0400000152						asm04000001520120071		she takes one-third, and so on in proportion, her share being an  equal moiety with the children. If she elects to take a child's  part instead of her dower, such part is taken subject to the payment of the debts of the estate. The interest of a child's part is  absolute and fee simple as distinguished from the life estate of  dower. Until dower has been assigned, the widow may retain the  full possession of the dwelling house in which her husband most  usually dwelt before his death, together with the out-houses and  improvements belonging thereto, free from rent. And in addition  to the dower interest, she shall be entitled to keep her wearing  apparel and such household goods, farming utensils, provisions  and clothing as may be necessary for her and her family.  A husband cannot cut his wife off entirely by will. If the  will makes no provision for her, or such as is not satisfactory to  her, she may signify her dissent, and may demand her dower or a  child's part.  A minor married woman may bring suit to enforce any  rights appertaining to her separate property without joining her  husband as a party.  A married woman may obtain from the circuit judge a license to manage her own estate, and to become what is known as  "a free dealer," in which event she may transact business of every  kind in every way, as if unmarried. The minimum cost of obtaining this license is about $50.  A wife may make contracts or enter partnerships without her  husband's consent, but she is not bound by her contract unless  she is a free dealer, except in certain cases through equitable  proceedings, neither can she enforce the terms of a contract, unless her husband enters joint suit with her.  The widow is entitled to the benefits of the homestead exemption provided for in the Constitution of the State.  The husband cannot dispose of the homestead by will where  there are any children. Children, in this case, means living issue  of the marriage, and is not limited to persons under twenty-one  years of age.  A married woman's wages and earnings acquired by her in  any employment separate from her husband are her own separate  property and subject to her own  disposal,  and she  may sue for	51687558 Bytes	3392	5077	3610205916	RGB	8	600	asm04000001520120071.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1563	1563	1564.jp2	/asm0400/image/1564.jp2

Where the husband has been judicially adjudged insane, and  has continued in such a condition for a year, the wife may convey her real estate, or make binding contracts concerning the  same without the signature of her husband.  The proceeds of life insurance where the policy is made payable to the wife, or specifically to the children is in no way liable  for the claims of creditors, unless the policy specifically declares  that it was made for their benefit. It is otherwise, when the  policy is payable to the estate. \  Miscellaneous  The legal causes for divorce are the same for both husband  and wife.  The father is considere 1 the natural guardian of the children,  but in case of a separation the custody of the children is left to  the judgment of the court.  The age of consent in Florida is eighteen years.  The punishment for bastardy is a payment not exceeding $50  and all necessary expenses attending the birth of the child, at  the discretion of the court, yearly for ten years, toward the support and maintenance of the child. The reputed father shall  give bond with good and sufficient security to be approved by the  court, for the due and faithful payment of said sum of money.  The bond shall be void in case of the death of the child.  Intercourse with an unmarried female of any age, with or  without her consent, she being an idiot, lunatic or imbecile, is  felony, punishable not exceeding ten years in prison.  The punishment for pandering is imprisonment not to exceed five years, or a fine not to exceed $1,000, or both fine and  imprisonment.  Florida has no punishment prescribed by law for seduction,  which is counted neither a crime nor a misdemeanor, nor is there  a law against the taking of indecent liberties with young girls.  Florida has no law requiring the employment of women as  matrons, keepers, nurses or physicians in State, County, and City  Institutions having the custody of women and girls.

Special Collections	Woman’s Club of Coconut Grove Records	ASM0400										asm0400000152						asm04000001520120091		The laws of this State do not prohibit night work for women  and girls, nor do they require sanitary regulations for factories  and shops, nor prescribe their hours of labor.  The punishment for wife desertion in Florida is imprisonment in the county jail not to exceed six months, or a fine not  exceeding $500, or both fine and imprisonment. (If wife desertion were made a felony, the husband could be brought back  when he takes refuge in other States.)  Children may be legally adopted in Florida, after the notice  of adoption proceedings have been published in a newspaper, at  least once a week for thirty days. A petition is then made to  the circuit court, asking the judge to give the applicants legal  possession of the child, and having an attorney present the facts  in the case. The general cost of adoption proceedings ranges  from $25 to $100. If the parents of the child to be adopted are  living, notice must be served to them, giving date and place of  hearing.  The Juvenile Court law which was passed at the last Legislature is of especial interest to the club women of the State, as  many of them worked towards its passage. It means that encouragement, helpfulness and kind treatment will be substituted  for punishment as a means of reforming children. Detention  homes will supplant the Police Station, the jail and the chain-  gang. Children will be considered as offenders, not as criminals,  Hearings in Court will be done away with, and conference with a  sympathetic judge will be held to ascertain what can be done to  help—not punish—the child. The Probation officer will supplant  the Sheriff and Police officers. The public funds will thus be used  to make citizens—not criminals.  Some Recent Gains in State Legislation   in Florida  A law requiring service to be made to parents and guardians  of minors under arrest.

A pure food law.  Free text books for dependent children.  An Anti-gambling law.  A law prohibiting the publication of the name of the woman  in assault cases.  All of these good measures, also the Juvenile Court Law  which was quoted more at length, were the work of the Legislature of 1911.  Some   Things   That   Other   Legislation   Departments of Federated   Clubs  Have Helped to Bring About for Their States  Teacher's retirement and pension laws.  Medical inspection of school children.  A thrift-teaching law, resulting in the establishment of  school savings banks.  Child labor laws.  Anti-gaming and anti-cigarette laws.  The appointment of a woman assistant to a State Labor Commissioner.  Improvement in working hours for women.  A law for the prevention of transmissible disease.  Wife and child desertion laws.  Legislation looking to the prevention of blindness.  Laws for the equal parental guardianship of children.  Twenty-nine States have enacted legislation permitting  women to hold places on school boards.  Outlines for Club Study  It is quite understood that this entire program may not  prove practicable for all clubs, but it is the earnest hope of the Legislation Committee that as many of the topics as possible will be  taken up for discussion. After the club season has passed, a  questionaire will be sent out, and from the tabulated results of  the investigations and conclusions of the club-women of the  State, a series of the measures will be prepared for presentation  before the next meeting of the  Florida  Federation.

FARNHAM GIVES LECTURE  IN WHICH HE DESCRIBES THE  GREAT WORK AT BATTLE  CREEK—MANY INTERESTING  PERSONAL NEWS NOTES.  The gathering on Thursday the 13  at the Housekeepers' Club to hear  Mrs. Damon Archer's paper on  "Bread, Cakes and Pies," and Mr.  &lt;€, H .Farnham's talk on Hygiene  was   unusually  large.  Mrs. Archers' paper had been I  looked forward to for sometime and  was thoroughly enjoyed. It was full  of useful information and bright and  to the point, and was voted one of  the best club papers this season.  Mrs. Archer is a prominent member of the club and holds the office  of librarian of the club's papers  and magazines, which she passes  along when they have served their  purpose among the number.  At the last business meeting she  reported having sent 7 bundles of j  these papers and magazines to the;  sponge fleet, and having received)  most sincere-^anks for them from j  the men on the*banks.  After   Mrs.   Archers'   paper,     Mr. }  Charles H. Farnham was introduced, j  It is safe to say, that it is seldom i  that a gathering of women outside j  the large centers of life have the  opportunity of listening to such a  scholarly and interesting discourse  as the members of the Housekeepers'  Club did last Thursday from Mr. C.  H. Farnham, of New York, when  that gentleman talked to the club  upon hygiene and diet,, as connected  with our daily life. The effect of  the talk will be a lasting one and  the women who heard Mr. Farnham  will not forget his forceful words on  the  subject.  if is  y  1  A3  The latter part of the lecture was  devoted to an account of the Battle  Creek Sanitarium system, and the  foods prepared there. Many of  those present were amazed when  told of the attractiveness of the  place, for comparatively few in  Florida know anything about Battle  Creek except as a place where cer- ,  tain breakfast foods are manufactured. That such a splendidly arranged and managed institution exists, and is spreading its influence is  indeed a fact worth knowing and  helping.  Mr. Farnham was the recipient of  most sincere and hearty applause at  the conclusion of his talk and courteously met-the ladies and answered  all questions they asked.  It was a red letter day on the  Club's program, and an unexpected  one, for Mr. Farnham As only kere  tor the winter and kindly consented  to give the talk in a feeling of gratitude to Dr. Kellogg, of the Battle  Creek Sanitarium, for what that institution had done for him in the  way  of  restoring  health.  Very handsome booklets of the  Sanitarium were on the table for  those wishing to take a copy, and  the Battle Creek Monthly Magazine  called "Good Health" will be one of j  the Clubs' magazines in the future. I  Mrs. Perry, the mother of so many  sons and daughters;  a great grand-j  mother several times, was one of the j  Clubs* guests for the afternoon, and  thoroughly enjoyed the meeting.       j  Madam Peacock was also present,  also the latest bride in the Peacock  family—Mrs. Albert Victor Peacock.  Miss Williams, principal of the  Cocoanut Grove School and several  guests of the Club were also present.  Miss Williams is making many  friends here. Cocoanut Grove is especially fortunate in the school  teachers.	83749492 Bytes	4792	5824	1282996836	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510016001.tif		2013-03-04	2013-03-04	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1600	1600	1601.jp2	/asm0400/image/1601.jp2

The Club entertained nearly a hundred guests, and every one enjoyed  the afternoon. The first thing on  the program was a poem read by  Mrs. T. W. Mather, called, "The  Song of the Scientific Housekeeper.',  Two verses of which will give an  idea of what we should be:  "Before we learned to do things  right we always used to cook  Without so much as peeping at a  dietetic  book,  But this is not the way at all, as  science  has  made plain,  And now, as we prepare the meals,  we murmur this refrain:  "There's nitrogen, and hydrogen, a  small per cent of fat,  The carbo-hydrates, gluten, starch  —remember all of that;  The right of proportion must be  found in every meal each day,  For 'tis the only accurate and hygienic  way."  Pa hopes in vain for ham and eggs;  the children can't have pie;  The boarders one and all have left  —we  often  wonder  why.  We  steadfastly  decline  to   do     the  way we know is wrong,  And as we cook the daily meals we  hum  the  well-known  song:  "There's  nitrogen,  and  hydrogen, a  small per cent of fat,  The  carbo-hydrates,  gluten,    starch  —remember all of that;  The right proportion must be found  in every meal each day,  For  'tis the only accurate  and  hygienic way."  This was receivel with great applause, especially after the Club's  good food, and hygienic living talk  the week  before. ——  After the poem Mrs. Harlan(#app$  delighted every one by singing,  "Little Boy Blue. ' Mrs. £?app has  a lovely voice, and a most~T?leasing  manner   in   the   ues   of   it.  Then followed a short account of  the awarding of the Nobel prize for  Literature, to Miss Selma Lagerlof,  the most famous woman in Scandinavia. She is one of three women  who have won the prize, and the  account read of her, and her home,  by Mrs. Grace H. Manlove, was very  interesting.  Every one had been waiting for  the next number, a violin solo, by  Miss Dearborn, Cocoanut Grove's  clever little violinist. Miss Dearborn had to repeat her selection, it  was so thoroughly enjoyed.  Mrs. Walter DeGarmo came next  with a beautiful song. Mrs. De  Garmo is a great favorite here ,and  the storm of applause that greeted  her ever before she had sung a note,  proved the pleasure that was in  store for he raudience. Mrs. De-  Garmo's little daughter, Doris DeGarmo, is the youngest member of  the Housekeeper's Club, a love member, for she was votel in without  the usual ballot box.  The program was cloesd by a recitation given by Miss Hilda Baile.  The little lady had not conie to assist, but graciously did so in the  most delightful manner, and has  won a big place in the .hearts of the  members of the Housekeeper's Club.  The afteronon ended by the serving of delicious cake, canly, and  candied fruit, and Club tea. A great  many beautiful gowns were worn for  the first time, and gave an air of  fastivity, as nothing else can do.  The president and officers received,  adn the young ladies present helped  serve   the   tea   and   cake.  Dr. and Mrs. John Gifford have  moved into their new house.  Mrs. Kirk Munroe entertained on  Saturday afternoon in honor of Miss  Williams, principal of the Cocoanut  Grove school, and Miss Carpenter,  principal of the Miami school.  Both ladies have many friends here.  Arbor Day will be observed on  Friday when two trees will be planted by the children. One by the  boys and one by the . girls. ^Mr.  Matehson  will  give the  trees.	82202572 Bytes	4736	5784	2334122989	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510019001.tif		2013-03-04	2013-03-04	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1603	1603	1604.jp2	/asm0400/image/1604.jp2

The program for the Housekeeper's Club for February is as follows:  "Business, (and this year children's day. After a snort business  session the club house is to be turned over to the children of Cocoanut  Grove. Ice cream and cake and  candy will be provided and if the  children do not thoroughly enjoy  the day it will not be the club members'   fault.  On the 10th there will be a most  interesting paper on Noted American  Women by Mrs. R. S. Truslow, This  is the second of these papers this  season, and is of unusual interest.  Mrs. Truslow is a woman of much  talent and knows how to handle  such a subject. Every one is most  cordially invited  in the afternoon.  The 17th is Exchange Day. It is  believed that this day will be a very  rich one in the useful and lovely  things that are to be offered. Homemade cake and candy and many articles of palmetto and cocoanut  cloth. On the 24th there will be  a lecture by Mr. Farnham on an interesting Canoe Trip. It is full of  interest and the ladies are most fortunate in securing it for the day.  March 3 is the annual meeting.  This day is especially the Club's  day and every member should make  a point of attending.

MUNROE RETIRES  FROM PRESIDENCY OE  HOUSEKEEPERS' CLUB  is succeeded by miss flora  McFarlane and   reception  FOLLOWS VERY INTERESTING  MEETING—RETIRING PRESIDENT WILL DEVOTE TIME TO  FORESTRY WORK.    / y     ^  The annual meeting of the Housekeepers' Club took place on Thursday March 3rd. There was a very  good attendance, and perhaps a better meeting never occurred since the  first in 189X when the club was organized.  The' president, Mrs. Kirk Munroe,  refused re-election, although the by  law made some years ago providing  that two years  be the limit of the  presidents term of office—would  have been set aside, but Mrs. Kirk  Munroe thinks two years long  enough for any one to hold such an  important office, and suggested a  plan that will bring many more  workers to the front. Miss Flora  McFarlane, founder of the C^b,  and the Clubs' honorary president,  was made acting president, with a  staff of six vice-presidents. One to  serve as presiding officer in each  club month.    The officers stand—  President,   Miss  Flora  McFarlane.  For March,  Mrs.  E.  It. Williams.  For April, Mrs, Grace H. Manlove.  For November, Mrs. R. L. Stewart.  For December, Mrs. Walter Waldin.  For January, Mrs. John Gilford.  For February, Mrs Florence P.  Haden.  The Secretary, Mrs. Ralph Munroe, re-elected.  For Treasurer, Mrs. T. W. Mather,  re-elected.  These officers comprise the  board of directors, the presiding officer acting as chairman of the  board Jor the month the serves  only.  The board, not the President, or  presiding officer, will appoint all  committees, and attend to all business. . ._ .  By this plan six splendid workers  are brought7 to the front, and club in  electing the board really manages  the affairs of  the  club.  At the conclusion of the session  Mrs. Kirk Monroe presented the new  presiding officer for xne month, Mrs.  E. M. Williams and Mrs. Williams  in a most graceful manner accepted  the chair, and called the club to  order.  Mrs.   Kirk  Munroe     received    an j  ovation  and  held  a  reception  after j  the  adjournment,  that  as  she  said |  made her "the very proudest woman  in the State."  Mrs. Kirk Munroe says she is going to give her time to her forestry  work, now. She is chairman of the  Forestry Committee of the Florida  Federation of Woman's Clubs, and  greatly interested in the work.  The Housekeepers Club Forestry  Day, is the last Thursday of March  the 31 ,and will be in charge of Mrs.  Kirk Munroe. An interesting paper'  music, and souvenirs made of Florida woods are promised.	83750244 Bytes	4792	5824	3704078116	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510027001.tif		2013-03-04	2013-03-04	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1611	1611	1612.jp2	/asm0400/image/1612.jp2

HADEN  MADE IT—VISITS OF DEACONESS   AND     BISHOP     TO     THE  a"ov* W fi  Among the many interesting afternoons of this year's program of the  Housekeepers' Club, looked forward  to, was that of last Thursday, Mr*.  Florence P. Haden'g Day. For whatever Mrs. Haden does she does so  thoroughly, and makes it all so interesting that no Cocoanut Grove  woman will be absent from the club,  when Mrs. Haden is hostess—-besides  being dearly loved, she has a wonderful faculty of imparting knowledge, and there are very few women  who could have made the subject or  her paper, Laundry Work, so interesting as Mrs. Haden did.  A half hour's discussion followed  the paper, and many little helps  from the experienced housekeepers  were gleaned. Mrs. E .R. Williams presided, as she is the chosen  member to fill the chair for March,  and she is doing it with all the  grace and dignity that the most exacting   club   could   wish   for.  Mrs. Haden was assisted at the  tea table by Mrs. Gifford, Mrs.  Stewart, and Mrs. Ralph Munroe.  Two new members, Mrs. Daniel  Gifford, and Miss Steere, were present, and the afternoon was one to  be  remembered.  Next Thursday is Exchange Day,  and Thursday, the 24th, is School  Day. Thursday, the dlst, is Forestry Day.	82184764 Bytes	4768	5744	3611459767	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510029001.tif		2013-03-04	2013-03-04	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1613	1613	1614.jp2	/asm0400/image/1614.jp2

Dear John Muir says: "The forests  of America,    however    slighted    by  man, must have been a great delight  to  God;   for they were  the  best  he  ever planted.    And  I    cannot    help  feeling that the Lord must have been  very happy in thinking out the for-/  ests of  South  Florida.     If  one  will!  notice tnere is nothing sad or lonely!  in   the   hammocks   of  Dade   county.  They are full of life and  blossoms.  jThere are very few wet and  soggy  .places, or dim mosshung byways.  There is color, and stir, and light. %  One may think he is alone on a|  Jquiet   day  when  penetrating  to   the!  depths of the woods, but wait a bit; |  ithere is a stir, a whir, a swift move-  Iment made by some bird or woods  jinhabitant that never once thinks of  throwing a* stone at you, even should  he see you?   All of a sudden there  comes the perfume of some opening  flower that you *do not see.  No.  never   once   does   the   nature-  loving man or woman find it lonesome   in   a   Dade   county   hammock.  Even the colors of the    tree    trunks  seem   alive  with  jo;f.     Look  at  the  beautiful bronze of the gumbo limbo  trees;   the   exquisite  mauve,   of  the  blossoms of the monkey ear bushes,  the rich colorings of the berries  of  the fiddlewood tree.    Notice the deep  green of the bay tree.  H     Florida   has   300   of  the   500   in-  Tdigenous   trees   of  the   country   and  I many more if transplanted trees are  counted.  And these hammocks are fast giving way to what is called the march  1 it civilization. . There are some wise  men from the east who are realizing  I the beauty of our native trees, and  in several cases only the trees necessary for the erection of a building  have been sacrificed.  One proprietor  of a ten acre lot  has gone so far as to have a forester  j label  every  tree  he  has  saved  and  j each year the trees    are    carefully  looked after.  I Others clear every tree, bush and  \ stick from a lot bought, and others  \ plant a few, what they call shade  i tr.ees, * giving them no attention, but  even that is better than no trees.  Let nie say one word for a newly  ] arrived stranger from the tree king- i  ! dom in this part of the earth, and  ! that   is  the   beautiful,   cheerful   and J  i&lt;	85734780 Bytes	4949	5773	3493669587	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510033001.tif		2013-03-04	2013-03-04	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1617	1617	1618.jp2	/asm0400/image/1618.jp2

COCOANUT GROVE, Fla., April  5.—The Housekeepers Club was  fortunate this past month in having  five club days* and Mrs. E. R. Williams as presiding officer. Mrs. Williams has walked right into the  hearts of the club members by the  gracious dignity she has shown in  the responsible position of presiding  officer of the Housekeeper's Ciub.  As there never was a more exacting, and also a more appreciative  set of women.  The first program afternoon was  on the 10th when the subject for, the  day was Laundry WorK, and it was  made so attractive t&gt;y Mrs. Florence P. Haden, that most of us  wished we could do our own washing, in fact, several) tried? the following week with the good result  that they noW know what the work  means.  Exchange Day followed on the  17th,  and was very successful,  The afternoon of the 24th, the  club gave over tjo the Cocoanut  Grove school, the ^ogram being in  the hands of the chairman of education, Mrs. G. H. Manlove, and  Miss Williams, the principal of the  school, and her assistant, Miss  Gladys Merritt, about 30 children  attended, but only 4 mothers.  It is a great pity that the patrons  of the school should always be so  busy that they have to forego the  pleasure of attending special day  given by the childi^n. There were  many remarkably good papers read  by the boys and girls, and nearly  an the subjects chosen were about  Florida. Miss. Williams made  known the principal) needs of the  school, one of the greatest being a  bell, and the club nas promised to  take ud the work of obtaining: one.  Florida forests, and work and information concerning the two National Forest Reserves that Florida  now has, it was in fact a history of  ■ forestry&lt; in iFlorUda,., Then Mrs,.  Kirk Munroe read a paper on Florida Rivers. This paper was written  by Mrs. Julie Hanson, president of  the Women's Club of Fort Myers.  It was full of information about  our beautiful waterways and many  stories connected with them, a  large map of Florida was hung so  "iat the locality of the rivers could  Je pointed out, as they were described.  At the close of the program the  many members ana their guests  were served with tea! and cake, and  a very happy^ hour was spent in seeing the beautiful collection of Florida woods that was on exhibit, also  articles made of Florida woods and  a really lovely display of tinted  photographs of Cocoanut Grove  roads, gardens and the bay—that  had been loaned by Mi%. Gross, of  Miami, for the afternoon. Forestry  afternoon will long be remembered  by those who were there, and the  hostess of the aftei-noon, Mrs. Kirk  Munroe, feels that the first Dig step  has been taken towards a setter  protection of local trees, if no further.  The pamphlet p^pared by Dr.  John Gifford on Florida trees, and  published by the Forest Department  of the Florida Federation of Women's Clubs, of which Mrs. Kirk  Munroe is chairman, was presented  to all present. The little book was  the first of its kind published by a  State federation for free distribution. Since its appearance three  others have followed.  At the close of the program Mrs.  E, £? Williams gare a talk, on  what club work meant and what a  great and responsible work it is;  ending her well timed words with  a most graceful tribute to the Club,  thanking the members for their  help during her month term of office, and announcing that at the  next meeting, April 7th, Mrs. G. H.  Manlove would take the chair according to order of election for the  month. The April program of the  club will be—  7th.—Business.  14 th.—Noted American Women  by Mrs. Alice Bush.  21st.—Exchange X&gt;ay.  28th.—Cftib's Annual Tea, arrangements for which are already  being made.  4&  y  yy	84728972 Bytes	4848	5824	3566933669	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510035001.tif		2013-03-04	2013-03-04	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1619	1619	1620.jp2	/asm0400/image/1620.jp2

BRIGHT WOMEN MAKE  ANNUAL TEA NOTABLE  IN ANNALS OF CLUB  TWENTIETH ANNUAL TEA OF  THE HOUSEKEEPER'S CLUB OF  COCOANUT GROVE IS ATTEND-  ED BY GOODLY COMPANY  WHOSE SPARKLING WIT AND  GOOD SENSE MAKE OCCASION  HIGHLY ENTERTAINING.  COCOANUT GROVE, Fla., April  28.—The annual tea of the Housekeepers' Club is always one of the  events of the season, and usually  closes the social season of the Grove.  This year it was entirely arranged  by Mrs. Grace H. Manlove, the club's  residing president for the month,  and was a very enjoyable affair.  Of course it was an invitation affair and in spite of so many members  and friends having gone north, over  fifty ladies were there to enjoy \he  good things provided.  Mrs. Walter Waldin, Mrs. Stewart, and Mrs. Gifford received, and  each guest as she arrived was presented with a bunch of pink and  white flowers by the two flower  girls, Eunice Peacock and Eleanor  Harris.  The table decorations were nasturtiums, and the hall was made  most attractive with palms, and yellow flowers of many kinds, yellow  being the club cplors.  The guests' ^iace cards at the  tables were hand decorated, and  very dainty, while the members of  the club found their seats by verses  rhyming with each name, such as:  "She is bonny, she is kind, with  her time never lags.  She is from Miami; you know her,  Mrs. Scaggs."  Guests and members gathered in  merry little groups on the piazzas  until 4 o'clock, when Mrs. Manlove  opened the doors of the main hall  and smilingly invited all in, to enjoy  the Housekeepers' Club Twentieth  Annual Tea.  After all were seated, Mrs. Manlove  gave in a few well chosen words a  very sincere welcome to all, and announced that while the ice cream  was being served, the toasts of the  afternoon would be responded to.  First came "To the Housekeepers'  Club" by Mrs. Kirk Monroe.  Then followed Mrs. S. V. R. Carpenter in response to "Trust in Cocoa  nut Grove.  Mrs. Carpenter said:  "The good word 'trust' is one of  the many unfortunate words of pur  Englisn language, capable of misconstruction, and it has been, in the  last few years, Americanized into indicating some pretty mean things.  For instance, two Irishmen, just  landed upon American soil, one said  to the other, 'Pat what is all this talk  I hear about 'tainted money?' '  'Sure, Mike and it means taint yours,  and taint mine, so its 'tainted.' *  "A corporation means union of  strength, and it is to be honored and  supported until it becomes ruled by  graft, then it becomes a Trust, as  the word is now understood. Here  in our midst, we have the Housekeepers' Club, a corporated body holding  controlling all the good things in and  about Cocoanut Grove, but it has  never become a Trust, because it has  no graft, and no greed, even its officers go a begging. However, its officers, both past and present, stand  by their guns, ready to fire a salute  to the honor of the club that they  love, the club they know is not a  trust, but can be trusted in the true  sense of the word, to always do  things right."  To the "Woman of the Day," Mrs.  Gifford said:  "Is she not here to speak for herself? The Woman of today, is, I suppose, the so-called 'new woman,' a  familiar, if not hackneyed theme.  Be that as it may, at any rate, new  or old, Were is no gainsaying the  fact, that we are here and you can't  get round us either. We stand firm  as a rock in the midst of things. We  look backward, and we look forward,  spinning the threads of life.  '9/6&gt;  7  Daughters of Jb've, motners ui men,  are we to pay the penalty of so prominent and exalted a position; Of  course we become a target ±o many  missiles all manner of sharcs being  hurled unmercifully at * us—the  weaker sex. Here, for instance, is a  sample, upon which my eye fell only  today:  " 'Women will work very hard to  get a husband and then work harder to lose him.'  "Rather hard on us, is it not? and  yet if we are wise the taunts should  find us smiling*  "We know that we are intensely in  tere§tea m life, in the whole of life,  and if mistakes are made and ridicule incurred why its but due to the  natural exuberance of youth. We  must be young since, are we not  'new?'  "As for the short-comings of the  women of today, of course, we admit them and as for all this clamor  for suffrage, which I for one find very  wearisome, and yet significant too,  and all right in a way, voicing perhaps some of our imperfect yearnings  for the race, as for all this, I sa&gt;  listen to the wisdom of an old color*  ed mammy, who has her own philosophy to account for women's inferiority and for her not having the  ballot:  " 'I ain't ever had no trouble in  believin' dat woman was made out of  man's rib. What worries em is why  de lawd's choice fell on de rib,  which ain't nothin' but a sort of rafter to hoid up a man's chist an' swell  hit out, an make him look proud.  " 'Cose I ain't a presumin' to  criticise de good Master, but hit does  dook lak to me dat when he was a  creatin woman, an' had de whole  man to cut from, dat he could have  saved us a lot of trouble ef he had  made Eve out of Adam's backbone I  instead of his rib.  " 'Hits becaze woman was made  out of man's rib an' man was left wid  all of his backbone dat he has got de  comeuppance over woman. Dats de  reason dat we women sits down an'  cries when we ought to git up an'  heave boickbats.*  "Far be it from me to advocate  heaving brickbats, but there's something in the old mammy philosophy,  ■ K	84150352 Bytes	4848	5784	1185714237	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510039001.tif		2013-03-04	2013-03-04	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1623	1623	1624.jp2	/asm0400/image/1624.jp2

"So here's to the woman of today.  May she have plenty of backbone, but  not grow stiffnecked. May she be  ever 'new,' yet never 'fresh,' and  when her time is up with 1fs- all hail  to the joyous maiden of tomorrow,  may she, may we, smilingly and undismayed, join the blessed ranks of  yesterday."  This response received the applause of the afternoon.  Then came the "Woman of the  Past" .Mrs. Mather said:  "Her satisfaction, her contentment with her supreme sphere, she  avoided testiness and won content,  and from contentment came a j  strength of inner character that in- j  spired the men of her circle. She |  was a factor in those days of our  early Americans. Tremendously effective if we read the letters and  diaries of Washington and Adams.  But she read well, and she thought  clearly, and when she spoke she said  something, and when he did she did  something, so here's to the women of  the past, whose unselfish, simple  lives, comes the saving grace for the  women of the present."  Several good stories were then  told, all bearing on the subject of  women, and domestic life. Mrs.  Truslow's poem on "Woman Suffrage" being especially good:  "Our Annual Tea" was given by  Mrs. F. P. Haden, the dearly loved  member of the club who is always  listened to with great regard.  "Here's to the annual tea! May  it's spirit of hospitality and good  cheer be fostered and may the custom of serving it be continued long  after we are only held 'in loving remembrance' in the hearts of those we  leave behind and on the pages of the  club's year book."  "Our Absent Friends" was answered by the whole company rising and  singing one verse of "Auld Lang  Syne."  The sun was just setting when the  last good bye was    said,    and good  wishes were extended to the Housekeeper's Club of Cocoanut Grove.  y?/o.

COCOANUT GROVE, Fla., May 10  —The  last  month's   work     of     the  Housekeepers'   Club   was    extremely  satisfactory.    Mrs.   G.   H.     Manlove  was presiding officer for the month  and hostess at the Club Tea on the  28th.  The first meeting was as usual  given over to business. This meeting of the year also includes the  report of the program committee,  and the approval of the coming seasons work by the club, and arrangements for the Annual Tea, several  new members were voted in, and the  club dues paid. Backward members  a~e notified that a member not paying her dues/before the 1st of June  will lose her vote for the year.  On the following Thursday April  14 the club enjoyed very much a  paper by Mrs. Alice Bush on "American Women Composers of Music."  This paper has been sent to the reciprocity bureau so that other club  women may have the benefit of it.  Address, Mrs. N. C. Wamboldt, Jacksonville. The 21st should have been  Exchange Day, but it was not held  as a business meeting of much importance was called to decide unfinished business of the various committees. At this meeting the Civic  Committee reported good work in  the way of cleaning streets.  The School Committee reported  that the school had been visited,  and the needs of the school, the  most pressing needs made note of,  that a school bell had been promised  t& a member of the club, and that  the school play ground fund, had  come up to $3 0; $17 of this being  contributed by club members. The  committee consists of Mrs. Kirk  Munroe, Chairman; Mrs. Richard  Carney, Mrs. C. J. Peacock, Mrs.  Wade Harris. The committee wj.u  do all they can with the help of Superintendent Hall, and the Cocoa-  rove special school tax trus- jl  tees, to improve the school grounds •  this next season, and to secure the  most necessary   teeds.  The Annual Tea came on the 28th, j  a special business meeting was called for May 4th and a satisfactory |  attendance was present to transact j  necessary affairs for the summer.

The Wonderful River System Of Florida  BY MRS. JULIA HANSON  Florida is very often called the  "Land of Flowers," but might, with  equal propriety, be termed the "Land  of Lakes and Rivers;" for it is, perhaps, as lavishly endowed with these  as is any state in the Union; and to  their presence Florida is indebted  for much of her fertility, and contrasts favorably in this particular  with Asiatic countries lying in the  same latitude—Egypt, Palestine and  southern China. The surface of  Florida is generally flat, an extension of the South Coast plains, being  the junction of the Atlantic and Gulf  Coasts; and its greatest elevation is  little more than three hundred feet  above the level of the sea. The  highest district is in the sandhills of  Florida, in the middle of the peninsula.  From its peculiar shape we find  Florida Rivers draining the country  in three different directions, some  flowing into the Atlantic Ocean,  some into the northern and some into  the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.  The Perdido River forms the western boundary of Florida, and thence  to the Suwannee, the country is, for  the most part, heavily timbered; but  from the Suwannee to the Atlantic  the land is generally flat and sandy,  showing but little vegetable growth.  The Perdido and Escambia Rivers in  the extreme west, are noted for the  beautiful bays of the same names  into which they flow; and the Escambia, which is wide and navigable  far up into the adjoining State of  Alabama, its high banks covered with  luxuriant verdure, is often called the  "Ocklawaha of West Florida," a little expression of the highest praise.  Proceeding eastward, we find the  Choctawhatchee (named from the  tribe of "Choctaws," and the Indian  word * Hatchee," signifying "river")  the goal of their ambitions! removed j  the "oaour of saneity," but failed to  obliterate the ravages of time. Disappointed, and deeply incensed, they  cruelly revenged themselves upon the  Indians.  The Suwannee is the next river of  importance, and it meanders first  | east, then west, but still southward  (bound, through Georgia and Florida,  receiving numerous tributaries, and  flowing through one of the most important fruit districts in the State.  The Suwannee is, perhaps, the best  known of all our rivers, through the  song which has made its name familiar wherever the Anglo-Saxon tongue  is used.  In the northeast corner of Florida  we find the St. Mary's River, which  (with feminine eraticism) flows for  half its length directly north, then  turns suddenly east until it enters the  Atlantic just above Fernandina.  Next comes the St. John's, beloved of  the tourist for its beauty, and accessibility; furnishing many miles of  navigation, and exhibiting in its waters, shores, scenery, vegetation, birds,  fish, and reptiles, an endless variety  of vastly interesting objects. When  the Redman ruled the forest this  beautiful expanse of water was  known as the "San Mates," and later  as the "Mango River;" although it is  generally conceded that the name "St.  John's" was bestowed upon it because the river was discovered upon  the day dedicated to that Saint. This  river reverses the order of most  American water courses, by "flowing  due north throughout its entire  j length.  | The Ocklawaha, the only import-  ■and tributary of the St. John's, en-  jters that river at the commencement of the second division; wThen  ithe stream resolves itself into a nar-  | row channel, passing through a semi-  I tropical jungle, dense with foliage,  I but    very     beautiful     through     its  from one to two and a half miles  in width; then narrows to a lovely  stream? running between high banks,  clothed with tropical verdure, and  intersected with luxuriant citrus  groves.  There is a pretty legend belonging to the Manatee, which tells how  in the wars of 38 and 40 a Spanish  officer fell in love with the beautiful  daughter of an Indian chief, whose  camp was on the site of the present  Bradentown. The father, who intended h*s daughter to espouse a  brother chieftain, was much incensed  when he discovered the love affair,  and vowed he would kill his child  rather than allow her to become the  bride of an enemy. The I young  couple determined to elope, and  started in a row-boat to cross the river, but the wary father discovered  their flight, and seizing his bow and  arrows, shot h4s daughter through  the heart: she fell from the boat,  and sank beneath the water. Her  lover, after vainly seeking her corpse,  also found a resting place in the  depths of the Manatee; but often on  moonlight nights, the sweet, weird  song of the Indian Maiden, bewailing  the sad fate of herself arid her beloved, is heard by those wandering  along the River banks.  The Peace and Caloosahatchee Rivers, which are wide and navigable,  lie farther south; the former flowing through much of the rich phosphate lands of the State, and the  latter connecting Lake Okeechobee  with the Gulf of Mexico. The name  originated with a tribe of Indians,  who inhabited this part of Florida  (antecedent to the Seminoles), the  'Caloosas,' and 'hatchee', Indian for  'river.' Many claim that this river  exceeds even the St. John's in beauty;  it rises in the marshes, a few miles  west of Okeechobee, and is about  sixty miles in length. Its width is  about   two   miles,   until   it   reaches  ■  I	83565540 Bytes	4843	5750	1808046291	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510041001.tif		2013-03-04	2013-03-04	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1626	1626	1627.jp2	/asm0400/image/1627.jp2

NOTES ON THE FORESTS OF FLORIDA  BY CHAS. T. SIMPSON.  ;  The northern visitor who comes to  Florida for the first time is quite  • likely to be disappointed in its vegetation. An impression has prevailed  quite generally in time past that the  greater part of the state is a swamp  that it and the drier parts of the  country are covered with a luxurious  tangle of tropical vegetation, where  great trees are loaded with blossoms  throughout the year. Instead of such  a magnificent growth he rides through  hundreds of miles of monotonous  pine forests, the trees in many places  tbjlnly scattered, and the poverty  stricken, sandy soil, covered with  a growth of saw palmettos. Here  and there at long intervals the train  runs through a bit of something like  what he had dreamed Florida to have  been, hardwood trees hung wich moss,  and filled in between with a dense  tangle of rich undergrowth. These  are the "hammocks", the name being an aboriginal word signifying  hardwood forest, and not the article  .in which people are accustomed to  loll around in on piazzas.  In the northern part of the state  ithese hammocks consist of various  Ikinds of oaks, hickories, elms and  jmaples, some of them identical with  forms found in the north, and mingled with these are species of mag  ?nolias, tupeloes, sweet-gums, cypresses  and many other forms having a more  southern range. The pines, are for  the most part, Georgia and long-  leaved species, (pinus palustris). As  one travels south the character of  the hammock vegetation gradually  becomes more tropical. That strange  almost startling tree, which was so j borders.  abundant in the northern half of the  state, the cabbage palmetto, becomes  more rare, though there fare still  an abundance of Red bays, Sweet  bays, (magnolia virginiana), cas-  sinis, (Ilex vonitoria) and mulberries,  (morus  rubra).  When one has reached the lower  keys the vegetation becomes strictly tropical. Even the pines, which  constitute the greater part of the  forest in the lower half of Florida,  is of a different species from those  inhabiting the upper region, having  been derived from the American  tropics. This tree which grows  abundantly in the province of Pina  del Rio in Cuba has rejoiced under  more aliases than a professional confidence man. It has been called  pinus heterophylla, P. elliotti, and  several other names, and the very  latest and most authentic is pinus  I caribaia. What name it may have  tomorrow no one knows.  Perhaps it may be well here to  give a life history of the forests of  Florida, especially of the southern  part, to conjecture, at least, where  and how and when they developed,  and from whence the members composing them migrated.

ELGOME TO ARBOR DAY  AND MANY HAPPY RETURNS OF IT TO THE  CHILDREN OF NEWARK!  The Shade Tree Commission  only wishes that the boys and  girls would make every day an  Arbor Day. Why not plant a  birthday tree for yourself each  year, if not on your own street, on some other  where the children will be happier for seeing it  grow? Make the year one long Arbor Day all the  way through; Spring for planting young trees,  Summer for watering them, feeding them and  keeping them free from insects, and Winter for  guarding them and learning to take the best of  care of them when they waken again in the  Spring. Try to find out what the little sign means  which you will see on many of the trees: "THIS  TREE IS A FRIEND TO ALL CHILDREN.  BE ITS FRIEND." Then join hands with us  around each tree in Newark and wish it "A Long  Life!" "A Useful Life!" "A Happy Life."	41544456 Bytes	3339	4145	2606556330	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510043031.tif		2013-03-04	2013-03-04	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1632	1632	1633.jp2	/asm0400/image/1633.jp2

They protect the pavement from the hot sun.  They add beauty and comfort to the city street.  They cool the air in summer and radiate warmth in winter.  WHERE TO PLANT TREES  Plant them 35 to 40 feet apart.  Plant them in good soil. Dig a pit four feet square by three  and a half feet deep. Replace the sand and stones by good  top soil mixed with well-rotted manure. See that the best  soil is near the roots.  HOW TO PLANT TREES  Dig the hole large enough to take the roots without crowding.  Cut off broken and injured roots with a sharp knife.    Make a  clean cut.  Trim back the top to counterbalance the loss of roots.  See that the earth is pressed firmly around the roots to hold  the tree in place.    Water thoroughly.  WHAT TREES TO PLANT  Trees for general street planting should be nursery grown. These  have compact root systems, straight stems and symmetrical tops, and are accustomed to transplanting.  Only a few varieties of trees do well in the city. Among  these the Norway Maple, American Elm and Sycamore  or Plane trees are easily the leaders.  Do not plant poplars or silver maples. They are short-lived,  clog the sewer pipes, raise the sidewalks and topple over  in storms.    The* silver maples also harbor borers.  j	41293624 Bytes	3318	4146	4110367706	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510043061.tif		2013-03-04	2013-03-04	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1635	1635	1636.jp2	/asm0400/image/1636.jp2

The raw materials it uses are the minerals from the soil and  the gases from the air.  The leaves are the machinery that take charge of the raw material and make it into the finished product, sap, that  goes  to feed every part of the tree.  The sunlight is the power that runs the machinery.  The waste products of this mill that the leaves send off into the  air are the very things that we human beings need most,  oxygen to breathe and moisture.  Do you know   of  any  other   manufactory   that   runs  itself,  furnishes its own materials and  gives away its products to  bless and brighten the world ?  That trees are the oldest living inhabitants on the face of the  globe ? That there are trees living now in California that  were already one thousand years old when Columbus discovered America?  That the trunk of a tree one foot in diameter and twenty feet  high can bear a weight of over thirty tons (61,600 lbs.)  That a full-grown tree sends out 187 gallons of water a day  through its leaves into the air ? Think what a difference  that makes in hot, dry weather.  That it will only cost $3.50 to have a healthy young tree  two inches in diameter, with stake and tree-guard, planted  in front of your house by the Shade Tree Commission?	42198128 Bytes	3372	4169	3771841659	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510043071.tif		2013-03-04	2013-03-04	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1636	1636	1637.jp2	/asm0400/image/1637.jp2

Give them  a  good  drink on a hot day.  Feed your tree now and  then with a little well-  rotted manure around  the base. Loosen the  earth to give the rains  a chance to reach the  roots.

How many are there? Are they young or old? Pretty healthy or needing a tonic?  How many of the Shade Tree Commission's young trees are there? (You will know  them by the stake and wire guard). Have you a tree in front of your house? If not, is  there one on your neighbors sidewalk?  DO SOMETHING  Do you think you could manage to give that tree a good drink twice a week, two or three  pailfuls each time, letting it sink in slowly? Bring in as many answers as you can to  these questions at the next meeting and we will talk them over.  Number of Old Trees in Block   Number of Young Trees in Block -  Health ,   Shade Tree Commission planting   How many Trees Watered?   How many Times  Watered ?... .,..  LEARN SOMETHING  What the Trees do for your Block  Watch the people on these hot days and see how they select the shady side of the street.  In waiting for a car see them stand under the shade of a tree rather than in the hot sun.  Notice the horse whose master leaves him in the heat, creep up until he gets his head  under the grateful shade cast by the branches of the shade tree. Think how hot and  sunny the house would be if that tall Maple were cut down, which now brings coolness  and shade to the front rooms? Many a sick person lies and watches the graceful swaying  branches and restful green on the leaves.  Do You Know  That a full-grown tree sends out 187 gallons of water a day through its leaves into the  air?    Think what a difference that makes in hot, dry weather.  That trees purify the atmosphere. The foliage takes in carbonic acid gas, which gas is  deleterious to us, and gives out oxygen, which is healthful—indeed indispensable—  lo us?  That a tree in front of your house makes it cooler in summer and warmer in winter?  That it increases the value of property. A house with a tree in front of it sells for  more than one without?  That half the people do not know these facts and do not appreciate them until someone speaks of it?  That you and I can help the City of Newark by knowing these facts, letting other people  know them too and lending a helping hand to the trees?  "Many a traveler in the heat, From a hundred leaflets fair  Finds the cooling shade most sweet, Fan his heated brow today,  Stops to rest within the shade And I think I hear him say:  That some wayside tree has made, 'Bless the hand that set that tree  Feels the moist and dewy air On this sunny street for me.'"

VIII  The facts which I have cited are so  familiar nowadays that it has seemed  hardly necessary to recapitulate them.  They had, no doubt, a psychological  as well as purely financial cause. They  may be explained in large measure by  the genuine and quite unprecedented  prosperity of the United States, which  was reflected, as prosperity always is,  by enthusiastic speculation. But they  were also reasonably to be ascribed to  what a French critic of economics of  high standing has called the "financial  megalomania" of our capitalists. The  phenomena bear close relation to the  inquiry with which we started out —  namely, to what extent a career such as  Harriman's is an omen for the country's  financial future, and what problems  will arise hereafter, if his exploits in the  credit market really foreshadowed the  next chapter in our financial history.  These questions are likely to be tested during the next year or two. All  that can now confidently be said is,  that the practices referred to have  already had a distinctly unfortunate  effect on the position occupied by the  American market in relation to financial Europe, and that the public mood  is such that resumption of the process  of exploiting corporation credit, on the  scale and for the purposes of 1901 or  1906, will almost certainly encounter  obstacles in the courts and the legislatures. President Taft's lately-announced policy of restricting ownership  by railways of stock in other railway  corporations, and of conferring on the  Interstate Commerce Commission the  power to veto issues of new securities,  except for the business requirements  of the issuing corporation, is one illustration of what the progress of events  may bring. Such a restriction will, to  many minds, seem superfluous and irritating, since, in theory at least, the  directors of a great corporation are assumed to act with the widest knowledge  and with the best interests of their properties in view. But the "Harriman  episode," taken along with the other  tendencies of the day which we have  reviewed, does not show that the theory  can be safely left to operate alone.  Not the least interesting aspect of  the situation is the bearing of all these  recent phenomena on the movement to  establish a central bank of issue. Mr.  Taft, in his Boston speech of September 14, pronounced it an " indispensable  requirement" that such an institution  "shall be kept free from Wall-Street  influences f9 But this is not in all respects so simple an achievement as  might be imagined. In more than one  quarter, it has been asked with much  concern, since the discussion opened,  how far we could be assured that a  central bank would use its necessarily  great power over the American money  market as we have seen the great state  banks of Europe to have done, — deliberately to place impediments in the  way of the extravagant use of credit  for exploiting and promoting schemes  of powerful interests in the market;  and whether it could be surely guaranteed beforehand that such power might  not be used, as even the United States  Treasury's great powers have been used  on certain well-remembered occasions,  to smooth the path of a daring and  dangerous experiment in the field of  speculation.	63228520 Bytes	3960	5320	3565486225	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510048021.tif		2013-03-04	2013-03-04	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1646	1646	1647.jp2	/asm0400/image/1647.jp2

It  was Japan, of course, settling in the  wake of the vanquished Russians.  Vague silhouettes moved across these  dimly-glowing squares. It was not  needed that a samisen should of a sudden send a minor chord groping into  the night.  In the morning all that had suggested  Japan, or anything we knew, had vanished. We were in a wide, flat, gray  town, covered all over, as it were, by one  huddling roof. A centuries-old, slow  town, crude in structure, bungling in  outline; a northern town built by dogged, big-boned northern men.  This was the first impression; but  walking in the streets one saw great  splashings of vermilion and gold, and,  over all, the aching, vivid, turquoise  sky. These crude, bold colors gasped  at one another and quickened one's  heart-beats even as the vigor of the air  had done, and the breadth of the plains  and the indescribable blue above.  The street life was nondescript, neutral; mule-carts and mangy donkeys,  lean, sniffing pariah dogs. The natives, great bundles of blue-gray rags,  all one tone, clumsy hoods dragged  over their ears, with curious, outstanding, fur-lined flaps, like wings. And  some with little ear-muffs shaped like  hearts, rimmed with fur and embroidered in gay colors. They wore black-  velvet and black-leather boots, soft  things like gloves, that made no noise.  The narrow street seemed crowded  with their bulk. Carts of fodder of  kaoliang, dried, yellow, rustling stuff,  brushed the crowd to fight and left.  Most of the shops were wide open to  the street. There were booths of food,  cooking and spitting in pans of boiling  fat, shoeshops with mammoth boots  of gold and painted lacquer hanging  from the curling eaves. Monstrous fans  VOL. 105-NO. 2  five feet across, with gilded sticks and  roses painted pink and red on black,  hung from other shops. Carved gold  and deeply fretted woodwork topped  other houses, and golden rearing dragons, with wide-reaching, trembling antennae. Long narrow boards of black  shining lacquer splashed with bold  gold Manchu letters, and red boards  streaked with black, dangled from  many eaves. Strange square-cut blood-  red shirts swung out on iron bars far  over the street.  It was a curious effect that one looked  at, with a sensation one might almost  say of hunger. The street itself was  gray and neutral; dun-colored mules,  dun-colored walls, dun-colored natives,  and the sudden terrific splashing of  gold, and spatter of red, fresh and clean  and beautiful as blood. And at the end  of the street the dull red gateway, low  and curving, through which only foot-  traffic might pass, and that almost with  bended head..  About the town spread high, smooth,  beautiful walls of gray, with regular  indented battlements. They meant  strength, and protection, and dignity;  and over each deeply-cut gateway  sprang a wonderful three-storied bell-  tower, like the flare of a great brilliant  flower blooming in the heart of a desert. These towers were colored fiercely  vermilion, with golden-dragons writhing and lifting at their four corners;  then came the smooth lift of plain red  surface with square openings, tiers on  tiers. The roof was smooth and slanting, row on row of shining tiles of green.  From every pointed cave hung a little  golden bell. These beautiful gateways  blossomed out in half a dozen places, in  the heart of the city, and at intervals  on top of those smooth, austere gray  walls.  This love of fundamental color must  be in the very .bones of the Manchus,  something that the freedom of their	68949564 Bytes	4280	5368	3022038751	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510048031.tif		2013-03-04	2013-03-04	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1647	1647	1648.jp2	/asm0400/image/1648.jp2

It is shouted  out of them, and stands for the primitive strength and vitality of the North.  For two hundred years and more this  rude northern race has ruled in China.  It is this forceful, vivid blood that filled  the veins of that wise, wicked, wonderful old woman, who for half a century  held the destiny of an empire in her  tiny yellow palm.  The Manchu tombs and temples lie  out across the plains, — three miles,  as our sleigh slipped over them. Dry  grasses, and weeds like little feathers,  stuck up through the snow, and stiff,  stunted bushes. Here and there were  rusty hemlocks and oak trees holding  fast in their empty branches enormous  balls of mistletoe — mistletoe with  orange-red berries. These people have  an intuitive sense of color and effect.  Our eyes for miles had known almost  an unbroken field of white, the dazzling glare of it, and, bowling over  all, the masterful blue of the sky. In  the middle of this blank page, as it  were, there sprang up suddenly a passionate red gateway, the pai-lou, with  its triple entrances, its cross-beams, and  curling eaves. A gray wall flanked it  on either side, and leaning heavily upon  the walls were the curving branches of  pine trees, resting there in their great  age.  We were in a grove of pine trees,  through which gleamed red temples,  low and spreading, with beautiful roofs  of royal yellow. It was a silent place.  We walked into the deserted court  and looked down an avenue flanked  on either side by crouching, grotesque  marble beasts. These fanciful, beautiful temples, carved and gilded, held  great monoliths imprisoned, upright  steles borne on the backs of sprawling  marble tortoises. We peered through  the red bars at these curious symbols,  climbed innumerable little steps to  other temples, heard our footfalls echo  in the marble court, and drank in color,  red and gold, blue and yellow, with a  background of dense dark green.  The treetops were full of a constant  murmuring. A kite wheeled and whistled in the blue sky above our heads.  Two native pilgrims approached the  temples, bowing low, step by step.  Every year some prince of the blood  comes to Mukden to offer up prayer  and incense to his ancestors in these  beautiful red temples lying out in the  white snow. Last year the Empress-  Dowager herself had planned to visit  this ancient capital of her forefathers.  A great clearing and rebuilding and a  flood of vermilion lacquer followed this  vaguely expressed wish,—and then the  Empress died.  But the old palaces which she was  to have occupied have been rescued  from ruin, and their lovely grace and  brightness give delight to the few who  chance to visit them. This glowing  group of red and gold and royal yellow  lies in the heart of Mukden. They are  not palaces as we know them, but low,  single-storied buildings, with beautiful  straight beams and curling eaves, suggesting and probably copied from the  ancient Tartar tents.  Behind these fragile lacquered walls  is hidden an untold wealth of treasure,  the sacking of which was so feared by  the Chinese that they brought their  war with Japan to a halt. There was  a great unbolting and unlocking of the  red doors and a tearing away of absurd  paper seals, before we could gain admittance; two soldiers, with bayonets  fixed, standing meanwhile by our sides.  Treasure after treasure, endlessly  wrapped and packed with little papers  of camphor, was placed for a moment  for inspection on a sort of yellow lacquer counter.

Special Collections	Woman's Club of Coconut Grove Records	ASM0400										asm0400000151						asm04000001510048051		/y  THE COLOR OF MUKDEN  243  of yellow satin embroidered solidly in  seed pearls, daggers with diamond hilts,  priceless kakemonas painted by China's  greatest artists, and others painted  with a needle cunning as a brush. All  these things, and many others, were  shown us in this temple storehouse  piled to the eaves with cabinets and  boxes.  We walked at last out of that cold,  dim treasure-house, into the court, full  of melting snow and blinding sunlight,  and across it into the audience-chamber, where that audacious, ivory-colored, paint-enameled Manchu princess had meant to hold her court. It  was dark as we stepped in from the c  dazzling light — but full of the gleam  of gold: eaves gold, walls gold, and in  the centre of the room a raised and  canopied dais. On this, before a monstrous screen, stood the throne — a  giant's chair of gleaming old gold lacquer, a deep shining seat, smooth as a  mirror, wide enough and deep enough  to seat three men—a royal, five-clawed  dragon rampant on arms and back.  The whole chamber was carpeted  with a thick and brilliant rug of royal  yellow, and this yellow, newly laid,  and newly woven tapestry, was covered  inch-deep with the dust and dirt of  months,— feathers, broken birds' nests,  bits of earth; and as we looked in amazement we heard a stir and movement  above our heads, where amid the golden  eaves the fowls of the air were nesting  unmolested.  We followed our guide into the gloom  and deathlike chill of still another wonder-house, and paused on the threshold  in amazement. The place was lined  with cabinets and shelves, and there,  row on row, piled and stacked, was an  array of imperial porcelains, each bit  a fortune in itself; bowls and basins and  vases of matchless " blue and white,"  ginger-jars with lovely plum pattern,  clear white with rich blue medallions,  curious old vases of Persian blue —  form and pattern Persian, — piain  blue and " powder blue." There they  stood, great toppling columns of them-  rice-bowls, tea-bowls, ordinary vessels  of everyday use, cast as it were in gold,  and piled as unconcernedly as coarse  hotel crockery bought by the ton.  One end of the room was packed in  yellow: rice-bowls, soup-basins, tiny  sam-shu cups, frail as eggshell, piled  by the dozens —or hundreds rather:  the pure undecorated royal yellow, half  mustard, half canary, with the imperial  dragon swimming beneath the glaze.  There were big vases of a glistening  bronze, of swelling and perfect proportions, with iridescent gleams of flame  and peacock green, dim and drowning.  There were others of sea-green, of a  pure and delicate wash, others again  pale blue, the very ghost of a summer's  sky, with outlines simple and demure.  One's fingers itched for the feel of them,  the sliding surface and the satisfying  shape. There were gourd-like vases  running through every tone of purple  and thick brown, and ending in petunia and amethyst and rose. There  were scores of deep cream pieces, and  biscuit boldly crackled. There were  vases black as night and glossy. Fa-  mille verte, in pairs, with handles and  quaint decorations, each color distinct  and pure.  We found four shelves of precious  "peach-blow," — slender little vases,  identical in form, some placid and perfect peach, some a trifle pale, others  ruddy, but all of the surface of satin  and without a flaw. There were thirty  in the group, a common sisterhood,  doubtless of one firing, and probably  akin to the "peach-blow " in the "Walters" collection—identical as it is in  shape and color. On another shelf were  as many little " peach-blow " boxes,  varying as a flame varies in tone and  intensity.  -y y	65803508 Bytes	4119	5323	3506531826	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510048051.tif		2013-03-04	2013-03-04	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1649	1649	1650.jp2	/asm0400/image/1650.jp2

More " blue and white,"  some wondrous sang de bosuf, pulsing,  throbbing tones, red and thick as blood-  clots. On the same shelf stood a pair  of vases of greenish-blue, with a glaze  brilliant as enamel, and crushed into  it a warm fawn-color, like a turquoise  matrix, mixed and melted. Hundreds  of bowls again of dazzling white, thin  and exquisite, each piece with the clear  chime of a bell—rice-bowls, wine-cups,  tea-bowls, fish-bowls, repeated and repeated. Near them were dozens again  of cups and bowls, " apple green " this  time, the royal dragon sprawling round  the brim half smothered in the paste *  — and so it went.  Finally we dragged ourselves away,  out again into the dazzle of the snow  and the bold blue sky, and faced once  more those amazing dwellings of vermilion lacquer.  What was the sum of it all ? It made  one pause and consider. A race that  can think in such fearless, fundamental  colors, without fuss, or futile decoration? And one sees this legend repeated  again and again on every side, in the  hard, enduring things of stone, the  blunt monoliths, the time-serving tor  toise. Every symbol of the land pointing alike to fundamental, enduring  things, — patience, labor, discrimination. This chaotic, inchoate, centuries-old China — what is the meaning  of it all? It is a thing to make one  think — to think mightily, and think  again.  We left Mukden at sunset and turned  into the street, to be smitten mute by  a crushing sense of color. The world to  the west was one gorgeous conflagration — an intense, molten, blinding  flame. Every tone in the street paled  and faded. One paused, stunned and  helpless, with a sense, rather than sight,  of dim blunt figures looming up confusedly along the whole length of the  way. Bewildered and half-blinded, we  strove to advance against this crushing  color in the west. But with the world  black and swimming, we dropped our  gaze and turned in desperation to a side  lane for escape. A spell had fallen on  the noisy thoroughfare— utter silence,  save for the jangling bell of a mule that  stubbornly pursued his course. His long  black ears, as we turned for a last  look, stood out in comical and wagging  silhouette against that background of  boiling gold.	62441288 Bytes	3876	5368	697422672	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510048061.tif		2013-03-04	2013-03-04	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1650	1650	1651.jp2	/asm0400/image/1651.jp2

CQNDRfl'S GDWDUGT GONDE^KlU  By COCOANUT GROVE HOUSEKEEPERS  | Housekeepers flub  '   Held First Meeting  With Much Interest  COCOANUT GROVE, Nov. 4.—The  first meeting 01 the Housekeepers'  Club was held on Thursday, the 3rd,  and was well attended. The president of the club, Mrs. Flora MeFar- j  lane,% has not arrived yet, and the !  presiding officers for the month, Mrs.  R. L. Stewart, being away also, the  chair was taken by the secretary of  the club, Mrs; Ralph M. Munroe.  The meeting was the business meet- j  ing of the  month.    The club house!  had been put to good    order,    the  grounds cleaned  up  and  everything  ready for a busy season.  A letter was read from a woman  who had bought Everglade land, asking the club's advice about it. It  was voted that in future when such  questions were asked, advice would  be to buy, and read Mr. Waiter Wal-  din's book on Florida land and what  to do with it.  It was voted to let the club house  be used by the Cocoanut Grove chapter of the Woodmen of the World in  their entertainments.  Also to buy 500 Federation Christmas stamps, and to aid with prize essay fund to be given by the federation on the Merit System in relation  to appointment of teachers.  Mrs. T. W. Mather was appointed  chairman of the Village Improvement Committee for the month  Three new members were proposed, and delegates to the meeting of  the Florida Federation of Women's  Clubs to be held at Ocala, on the 16,  17, and 18th, of this month. Appointed are, Mrs. John Gifford and Mrs.  Florence P. Haden.  Mrs. Waldin made an earnest appeal to the members to work for the  club fair to be held on December 15,  wh'ch she is to manage.  The next meeting of the club will  be of special interest, as six of the  members have promised 10 minute  talks on important events of the summer—Mrs. Kirkpatrick, Mrs. Carpenter, Miss Steere, Mrs. E. N. Williams,  and Mrs. T. W. Mather.  Mrs Kirk Munroe will read a sketch  of her trip to St. Paul, Minn., and  give a brief account of the Conservation Congress which she attended as  a representative of the Florida Federation, and chairman of the Forestry Committee of Florida.  As chairman of the School Committee of the Housekeepers' Club, Mrs.  Kirk Munroe reported that the school  yard had been cleared. A good bell  given to the school, a flag pole set  |and a committee appointed to visit the  school several times during the  month. The club's treasurer, Mrs,  T. W. Mather, reported no debts an  a tidy sum in the bank.  The   club   then   adjourned   to  th«  tea  table,  and  a  social  chat  before1"  good-byes were said.  RESOLUTIONS PASSED AT  MEETING HELD THURSDAY  Kirk Munroe Thanked for  Making Reply to the  Nebraskan  ACTION TAKEN AFTER PLEASANT MEETING OF THE CLUB,  WHICH HAD AN UNUSUALLY  INTERipplXG PROGRAM—MRS.  MUN E REPORTED ON CON-  SEKl ITION CONGRESS.  -OANUT GROVE, Fla., Nov.  1 . -There was an unusually large  gathering at the Housekeeper's  Ciub on Thursday, the 10th, to enjoy the papers on the important  events of the summer, and review of  summer reading that were given by  the members, led by Mrs. Kirkpatrick, whose paper on "Summer Art"  was delightfully written and read.  Mrs. Kirkpatrick also brought a  greeting from two clubs in Texas to  | the Housekeepers' Club.  Mrs.  E.  R.   William's sketch,  was  on   the   children's   dinner   and * the  need   to   be   more   careful   about  it,  her paper brought on a discussion that  proved very entertaining.  Mrs. T. W. Mather read a poem on  the new-fashioned hat, that brougnt  down the house, although Cocoanut  Grove disclaims any knowledge of  such bead wear.  Mrs. Steere took for her subject  the laws regarding fishing, and handled it most entertainingly, a subject that many are interested in and  know nothing about.  Mrs. Florence P. Haden told of the  summer reading elub for which she  was responsible. What a pleasure  it had been to those taking part.  Mrs. John Gifford had , been the  reader, and the meeting had been  held at the different member's I  homes.  Then Mrs. Kirk Munroe gave an j  acocunt of her trip to Minnesota this  summer, and a brief outline of the  Conservation Congress held at St.  Paul which she attended as a delegate from the Florida Federation of  Women's Clubs, in which she received a regular Housekeepers'  Club   ovation.  fr,n,?e.f0re   ^e   club   adjourned   th©  by  MrsngTrew1U^°n.Was   introd^ed  'Mrs   w»iT'    T, father,  seconded  by  iJ^^^erCrofts,  and   unanimous-	107772604 Bytes	5104	7037	2875501518	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510055001.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1671	1671	1672.jp2	/asm0400/image/1672.jp2

Musical affair at Coconut Grove, a delightful event (page 91)					Written on front: "1910"; "91"					1910-1920			eng		University of Miami Libraries.

JOHN GIFFORD AND MRS  CAMPBELL—RECEP-  FEDERATION   PRESI-  EDMUND  TION TO  DENT.  COCOANUT GROVE, Jan. 3.—  The Housekeepers' Club hall was the  scene of a very enjoyable gathering  on Saturday afternoon, when eight  little boys and girls gave an entertainment for the benefit of . oar  school. Perhaps I should say six  girls and 2 boys took part in the  songs, tableaus, and recitations presented under the management of  Mrs. John Gifford, and Mrs. Edmund  D.  Campbell. \  The program began with a Chinese overture rendered by Mrs. Gifford, and Mrs. Campbell.  Then Mrs. Gifford announced thai  there would be three Chinese songs,  sung by Roderick Carleton, Wesley  Asbury, Sophia Baker, Rose Carleton, and Doris DeGarmo.  The first was called a "Gift Flower" song, the children all carrying  flowers to give.  The second was a "Breakfast  Song" when the children sat on the  floor and ate rice with chop sticks  while they sang.  The third was a lamipin, the lami-  pin being a musical instrument. The  singers were all in Chinese costume,  and did their part very well.  Little Doris DeGarmo then gave a  fancy dance and deilghted every one  with her graceful movements.  There was also a Chanticler song,  a sleighing song, and a delightful little song called "Candy," sung by  wee Berniece Clinkenbeard, who  looked as sweet as the name of her  song.  The tableaux "Red and White"  was represented by a little white  girl, and an Indian, both giving appropriate   recitations.  The Chinese school room and scholars was well done both by children.  The songs were followed by a recitation called "Daisy" and the little  girl who gave it was dressed to represent the flower in white and gold:  and her name was Helen Bower. She  was very charming and did her part  very  acceptably.  There was a very dainty song by  three little girls dressed in Dutch  costume called "Three Knitters,"  who sang as they clicked their needles.  This was followed by a very successful ditty called "The Secret" the  children all in Dutch dress.  The program 'ended with the song  and march called the "Feast of Lanterns," children in costume.- But I  must not forget to mention a very  clever bit of acting and recitation  given by Adeline Clinkenbeard', called "Jerry the New Boy." Little  Miss Clinkenbeard was called upon  to fill a vacancy and did it not only  'ly .but most graciously.  The was      decorated       with  flags and  (Miiis  the ladies, who made the afternoon ]  entertainment possible, the childrerfj  who took part, were none of them j  over 11 years, and their interest in  what they were doing was charming.  The Housekeepers' Club reception  in honor of the State Federation of  Woman's Clubs' President, Mrs. J.  S. Frederick, was one of the successes of the season, and thoroughly  enjoyed. Mrs, Frederick's address  was one of her best and1 made her  hearers feel not her ability, but her  loyalty to the cause.  Mrs. A. Leight Monroe was a guest  of honor, and Mrs. Rickmers, corresponding secretary of the State Federation, was also present.  Also Mrs. and Miss Cas-^ of Washington and the mother of Cocoanut  Grove was also present, Mrs. Isa-  bell Peacock, and was invited to  take a seat! at the President's table.  Miss Toundsand of New York, was  also a guest of the club, and Mrs.  and Miss Jackson.  Miss Flora McFarlane presided,  assisted by Mrs. Walter Waldin.  The Housekeepers' Club of Cocoanut Grove sends New Year's greetings to all the Women's Clubs of the  State, and extends a welcome to the  club  meeting every Thursday.  The   January   program     of       the  Housekeepers'   Club   is   as     follows,  and Mrs. John Gifford is the presiding officer for the month.  5th.    Business.  12th.

The "Mothers Congress" and  "Child Study Clubs", are all helping to inspire higher ideals  in both teacher and child.  Doctor Andrew White says, "What is  needed to be taught in this Country is truth, simple ethics,  the distinction between right and wrong".       Then Lyman Abbott  says, "As there are standards of art, by which we educate taste;  so there are standards of right and wrong, by which we may edu-  I  cate conscience,"  Abraham Lincoln has said "The aim of moral  instruction is to form character* and character is the unconscious obedience to conscience".  Thus I might consume much time, and reams of paper,  quoting wise words from noted writers, all of which you have  read, or can read at your leisure*  It has been my  experience  that there are moments in life, when no recorded advice, can  [be of use.  Our good old Puritan ancestors handed down some  ^ry   iron clad rules, a number of which it has been my  pleas-  to break most emphatically.   For  instance this one, "Thee  not whittle sticks on Sunday".

"Spare the rod and spoil the child", is another  maxim I have proven a fallacy.  My children have never been  beaten, and yet I have no cause to complain of any grievous  disobedience.  To me, a rule of love, is far preferable to a  rule of fear.  Pear engenders cowardice, and cowardice, deceit.  Both being phases of character that lead to an endless  line of trouble.  Pear of punishment is no index of a desire to do  right,  Before the whipping post was abolished, were men  better than they are today ?  When the school master stood beside his high desk, quill pen over his ear, and tough birch  rod in his hand, were pupils more obedient, more anxious to  acquire knowledge, than they are under the tutelage of soft  voiced women, born with the mother!s instinct, and who almost  unconsciously teach so many things not in the books ?  Babies begin their education in their mothers1 arms, and woe  to the wee mite who has for its mother a quick tempered, or  querulous, tearful, complaining woman, utterly unacquainted  with patience.  Love and patience are the two essential  qualifications in the training of young children,  More  kthan once in my life I have seen the seed of rebellion sown  ^ri the heart of a sobbing child by an injudicious slap.   I  ve seen a happy-go-lucky, honest hearted, thoughtless boy,  ^^»sformed into a sneak and hypocrite, by a cruel whipping,  ^^^^listered by his austere, unsympathetic father.

Parents and teachers, frequently punish  to relieve their own wrought up tempers.  Though sometimes  a remembrance of the whipping it required to make them grow  up perfect, has its influence in their conscientious wielding  of the rod,  I know of a little four year old bojr, who, after  a patient lecture, from his gentle mother about the cruelty  of pulling off flies1 wings, stood by the window, his blue  eyes full of tears, and his chubby hands thrust determinedly  into his pockets- then suddenly the fists flew out with deadly onslaught and he said "Dod*s flies, gp, to Dod".  This  was a case for patience.  Xhe child had learned to whom the  x'lies belonged, but his trait of cruelty would need long weeks,  perhaps years, of careful watching.  The main and most essential thing in the training of a child is to keep its love and  confidence, and the only rule I would ever consider, is the  Golden Rule, which is applicable to both old and young.	85639724 Bytes	4252	6712	470432766	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510070031.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1694	1694	1695.jp2	/asm0400/image/1695.jp2

It being Forestry Day, the tables  and the stage were decorated with  the foliage of the native trees.  Following the greetings by the  President, Miss MacFarlane. and pre.  siding officer, Mrs. Florence Haden,  Mrs. Potter, of New York, gave two  well rendered piano solos. Mrs.  Powers, of Missouri, Mrs. Haden's  guest and relative, sang most delightfully "Love's Echo" and "Two  Little Brown Owls." j  Mrs. John Gifford's talk on "Forestry at Home and Abroad," was  very interesting. Much stress was  laid on what work is possible in  Florida to preserve our native trees,  and1 many trees were suggested as  being particularly suited for our  streets, roads and marshes.  Mrs. Powers gave the large audience a rare pleasure in singing a selection from "La Sonambula," "An  Irish Love Song," "The Nightingale," "A Russian Folk Song," and  the intermezzo from "Cavalleria  Rustic ana."  Refreshments were served at the  close of the program, and all voted  a royal good time.  • • •  A SIGNIFICANT BEGINNING  A Government Expert on Eucalyptus Starts  Experiments.  Mr, Bristow Adams, the eucalyptus expert ofthe forestrry service, United States Department  of   Agriculture,   has  completed  the     experimental    eucalyptus  plantation   in   the   Everglades,  where 600 trees of various species  were   set   out   near   the  Davie  ditch on the South canal, on a  tract  of land  furnished by the  State.    In all, eighteen varieties  are being tried, in an effort to  find those best suited to Florida  conditions of  soil  and climate,  The entire plantation is on muck  soil,  and was started under exceptionally    favorable    circumstances, practically all the trees  having been set out in the heavy  downpours of rain that prevailed  in that  section  of the   ' Glades  last   week.    The   stock,   which  was raised  at the government's  sub-tropical  gardens   at Miami,  was in excellent condition,  and  while some of the eighteen kinds  were represented by very small  specimens,   all  were  in  thrifty  condition.  When asked whether he  thought the plantation would be  a  success,   Mr.   Adams  replied  /	88480496 Bytes	5001	5896	1520065105	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510076001.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1707	1707	1708.jp2	/asm0400/image/1708.jp2

I think I should say  'possibly,not.1 They are subject  to all the vicissitudes that any  tender plant must suffer. Out  worms and grasshoppers seem to  »have a special fondness for them ;  drying winds and hot sun may  sap their energy; or, if they survive all these, the submerging  which they must stand each year  until the drainage system is completed may prove too much for  sQ&gt;me."  tcOn the other hand, the plantation should successfully prove  which species are best under  conditions similar to those where  thes'e trees have been planted.  It m ust be understood that the  work has been undertaken by  the Federal and State authorities  in co-operation, not as a demonstration that eucalyptus will grow  in the 'Glades, but as an experiment to .see whether they will  or not. It is a trial and not a  proof. Because of the extremely  rapid growth of the eucalyptus, it  will be only a comparatively  short time, as tree growth is  measured, before definite results  may be expected, when the forestry service will be able to state  authoritatively just what species  are best fox each situation in the  eucalyptus range in Florida.'/  It is likely, Mr. Adams says,  that several species will prove  valuable, and that these, with  the Casuarina, or Australian  pine, will change the whole cha%  aeter of the Everglades landscape. They should serve a valuable use as windbreaks, to check  the sweep of winds over the wide  stretches of the 'Glades, and  should .furnish an abundant  source of timber and fuel.  Mr. Adams went back to Miami  | on Monday.    While there he will  | select and prepare for shipment  the trees that he is to plant at  | Tampa  and   Ocala,   where only  I those trees that are comparatively frost-hardy ivill be tried.  Florida is the only state east of  the   Mississippi   where  the cli-  1 mate is warm enough  to permit  I of the successful cultivation of  I eucalyptus.  While in the \ Glades Mr.  lAdams and his assistants were  I taken care of most pleasantly  1 at   the   home   of   Mr.   J.  H.   B.  Easton,   who   gave   them   every  |possible assistance in their work.

What kind of a citizen will women make, when  they get the privilege of suffrage? The question involves too much to be discussed at all, in this space,  but a wonder arises in our mind if the right of voting will make women more active in enforcing the  laws—or, at least, more careful about observing  them,  A Miami lady, a few days ago, gave an amusing  account of how^ her husband secured the aigrett  plumes on her hat. He met a Seminole Indian in  an out of the way place and gave him a dollar and  a half for the plumes, that would have cost twenty, at a milliner's store! The lady knew that the  buying of the plumes was illegal. She knew that  the acceptance of so small a sum for them was occasioned by the red man's craving for the whiskey,  that the money would buy. She knew that her husband was doing a dishonorable thing and yet she  told it with a sparkle that attested her admiration of  his prowess.  The effort to protect the aigrett is national in its  scope, and there always seems to be something ungentle about a woman who does not join the crusade against the slaughter of the little mother birds,  that have growm the beautiful, downy plumes for  their nestlings. Everyone, who reads, knows that  to secure the aigrett plumes, the skin on the bird's  body must be ripped off and that the death of the  mother bird means the pitiful starvation of the little ones.  Every child, who has been told the story of a  rookery pillaged by the vassals of feminine vanity—  every merciful man and woman look with accusing  eyes at women who in heartless disregard of what  the feathers represent, wear the aigrett shrouds.  &nZ.

DUNLAP HOPKINS, FOUNDER OF THE  NEW YORK SCHOOL OF APPLIED DESIGN  FOR WOMEN  OST people in New York are aware that for some years  past there has been a School of Applied Design for  Women down on Twenty-third Street, and that within  the past year it has been removed to a new and commodious building on Lexington Avenue and Thirtieth  Street, but few realize the profound social significance  of this school or remember that it has all grown out  of the inspired common sense of one woman. Mrs. Dunlap Hopkins  is a wealthy and fashionable woman, gifted with a wide understanding of life and social conditions. Being kind-hearted, she was often  appealed to in former days to help this or that struggling genius to  find a more or less precarious market for work that had but little  market value, and through experiences of this sort she came to realize  the great need for some system of training which would fit talented  girls to earn a livelihood by producing work of a kind that would  have a definite and permanent market value.  Here was an opportunity for the kind of help that would be worth  while,/and Mrs. Dunlap Hopkins enlisted the interest and support  of a number of her friends and, eighteen years ago, she founded the  New York School of Applied Design for Women. The institution  grew rapidly and within two years was self-supporting, so that three-  fourths of the subscriptions were returned to the donors, the founder  believing that the school would be hampered rather than aided by  having superfluous funds at its disposal. A modest tuition fee of  fifty dollars a year was charged each pupil for the regular course of  instruction. Special courses were added, and prizes were given for  good work, and the school found opportunities for the students to sell  any of their designs that proved to have a market value, no commission being asked for the sale. The instructors were all practical men  and women actually employed in manufactories or offices in the different branches which they taught, and one thing insisted upon was a thorough knowledge on the part of the student of the process by which  his design would be applied or reproduced. As a consequence, over  four thousand women have been fitted to fill permanent and well-  paying positions as designers, illustrators and architectural draughtsmen during the few years since the school has been opened. There  are now five hundred pupils, and the new building on Lexington  Avenue has been erected entirely by the school, with the aid of funds  contributed by Mrs. Dunlap Hopkins and other regular patrons of  the enterprise.

One winter she sang some of these melodies to a group  of famous musicians then in New York City. At  the end of the event a German court conductor cried,  "These things are unique, wonderful! How rich  your country is in artistic material." Miss Curtis explained to them  that not only were we losing this peculiar folklore music, but as a  nation actually destroying it, and Miss Curtis knows a great deal  about the Indians. Her preeminent call to fame is perhaps first  through her book of American Indians. She calls it "The Indian's  Book." In her preface she says, "The Indians are the authors of this  volume. The songs and stories are theirs; the drawings, cover design  and title pages were made by them. The work of the recorder has  been but the collecting, editing and arranging of the Indians' contributions." It would seem almost impossible that a person of an  alien race could have so completely presented the Indian's religion,  philosophy, poetry, romance and social attitude of mind as intimately  as Miss Curtis has done. It was only possible by working with them,  knowing them as friends, giving enthusiasm and winning confidence.  The songs, legends, stories of this book are as genuine and beautiful  as though heard from the mouths of great warriors around a camp-  fire of peace. Miss Curtis belongs to a family of book lovers and  writers. Her uncles, James Burrill Curtis and George William  Curtis are a portion of the culture of America. They were among  the noble company of brilliant minds at Brook Farm. And the old  Curtis home on Washington Place had the honor of receiving Daniel  Webster, Thackeray and many others of note who sought intellectual  sympathy. Miss Curtis had a most thorough training in music with  a pupil of Liszt, Arthur Friedheim, and also spent a most delightful  musical year at Bayreuth, where a valued friendship sprang up with  the Wagner family. Mr. Roosevelt has cooperated most cordially  with Miss Curtis in her work for the Indians, and her interest and  enthusiasm for them is not limited to her now famous book. She  has lectured widely in their behalf, has enlisted significant men and  women as their champions, she has sung their songs and told their  legends to win friends for them. She has been tireless in her efforts to  create a sane attitude toward the education of the Indian, a training  that will save and develop rather than destroy their art. Indeed, in  spite of her real gifts in music and literature, she is, though a young  woman, already best known as the Friend of the Indian.  678  A	88509152 Bytes	4977	5926	2446877080	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510087021.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1720	1720	1721.jp2	/asm0400/image/1721.jp2

N. Hillman is the active head of \  o, profitable farm of nearly 2000 acres. She j  was horn in St. Paul and for some years j  was well known as a stenographic report- i  er. Shortly before leaving for Canada she |  moved ;to a Wisconsin farm. Here she be- j  came interested in farming. She longed j  to get out on the Western prairies, so i  with what capital she possessed she took |  what she calls a "long chance" and staked j  her savings on Canadian land, says the St. I  Paul Dispatch.  What she did, she persists, many a girl j  now working on a small salary can do.  With her mother and small brother she  went into the icountry, purchasing supplies  in a blind way, for she knew little about  farming. She is now classed as one of  the large grain growers in the vtiicanity of  Mootsejaw.  From small beginnings her land possessions grew. At first it was 45 miles to  the nearest railway station. It was a  waiting game, but the market came, as it  must inevitably come to a fertile country,  and now what was once the frontier has a  station within easy hailing distance. Miss  Hillman's buildings are of stone and cement. The barns have cemented alleys  and it.takes a foreman and a staff of four  hands to run the place in the dull time  and eight men during the busy season.  Miss Hillman is the real head. She rides  about her farm and knows what she is  doing. Her system of farm accounts  shows every day where she is "at" financially, and she can tell you that back in  the year 1#09 she took off 8300 bushels on  230 acres and cleaned up over $&w*  THE BOANERGES OF WOMAN  SUFFRAGE  No one since the days of Frances E. Willard has  equalled Dr. Anna H. Shaw in the eloquence with which  she presents the cause of "votes for women." She is the  head of the National Suffrage Association of America,  which has recently established commodious quarters on  Fifth   avenue   for   an   aggressive   campaign.  /&lt;?&lt;z-  NOTED WOMAN BUILDER DEAD  Mrs.   Silverman  Personally Directed  Her Operations and Made Fortune.  NEW YO'RK, March 15.-«Mrs. Clementine M. 'Silvermann, probably the largest  woman real estate operator in the United  Sta&s and one of the few women operators in New York who personally superintended her own operations,  d'ied today.  In  all  kinds of  weather for the last 14  years,   Mrs.   Silvermann   has   directly   inspected   the   work   on   her   holdings.     By  studying   the   building   business   at   first  hand   she  became   an   expert,   and   often  pedestrians passing buildings in course of  construction   have   been   amazed   at   the  sight of her walking a beam or scaling a ,  ladder-.    Although  she  was  65  years  old, j  she continued in active work till last May, |  when shs became ill.  Mrs. Silvermann began as a real estate  operator 14 years ago, and it is a conservative estimate that she handled prop-,  erty valued at an aggregate of J20.WO.000.  She was a shrewd speculator and bought  in any district where an advance in values  seemed probable. Starting with a small f  capital, she was so successful that at the  time of her death she owned many properties and was reputed a wealthy woman.  A  VERY  PACIFIC   SUFFRAGIST  Mrs.  Clarence Mackay, from her luxurious apartment twenty-eight  stories   above   Madison   Square,   deprecates   all  sex-antagonism,   for,   she   says,   the   vote   will   come   to   women   not  as  the   result   of  a   fight  but   as   "the  logical   evo-    |  lutior   of   our   democratic   civilization."     She   does   not   believe   in  any   methods   that   will   "in   any   way   reflect   upon  the 'dignity   of   womanhood."	89640312 Bytes	4992	5984	3520260290	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510089001.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1722	1722	1723.jp2	/asm0400/image/1723.jp2

At a recent meeting of the Housekeepers Club a motion was carried  and a committee appointed to compile a list of suitable and suggestive  names for new towns and settlements in the Everglades and adjacent regions, and to forward this  list to all land companies and others  interested in colonization and development of these lands with the earnest request that they consider such  list in selecting names.  The committee acting on this motion compiled a list of names selected from the flora of Southern Florida, and a list of Seminole words as  well as a number of other euphonious Indian words. The recommendations of the board of geographic  names has been obtained from Washington.  The committee has drafted resolutions setting forth the object of these  lists as follows:  Whereas. The rapid development and settlement of South Florida  is resulting" in numerous towns and  villages being added to the map, and  Whereas. The suitable naming of  such places is a matter of great importance,  and  Whereas. The numerous land  companies and promoters engaged in  development have it in their power  to select names both appropriate and  euphonious, It is hereby  Resolved. To earnestly recommend that place names be selected, first in accordance with the rules  of the board of geographic names;  second, that the place names selected be indicative of local ^conditions,  associations or traditions.  Realizing how much such wise  choice of names may mean to the  future and desiring to aid in this direction, the following brief lists have  been compiled and are offered to all  those interested in this subject:  Geographic Names.  The following principles have been  adopted by the United States Board  on   Geographic  Names  for  guidance  in the selection of place names.  Principles.  Euphonious and suitable names of  Indian, Spanish, or French origin  should be retained.'  Names suggested by peculiarities  of the topographic features designated—such as their form, vegetation,  or animal life—are generally acceptable, but duplication of names, especially within one state should be  avoided. The names "Elk," "Beaver,"  "Cottonwood," and "Bald" are altogether too numerous.  Names of living persons should be  applied  very  rarely,  and  only those  great   eminence   should   be   thus  honored. No personal names should  be attached because of relationship,  friendship, or personal interest, norj  should names of obscure persons be j  given. Names of eminent men now  dead may be thus perpetuated, par-J  ticularly those of early explorers,l  naturalists, geologists, topographers,  etc.  Long and clumisily-constructed  names and names composed of two  or more words should be avoided. It  is a foregone conclusion that such  names will not be adopted by the  public. If the name selected consists  of more than one word the words  should be combined if practicable.  The possessive form of names  should be avoided unless the object  is owned by the person whose name  it bears. *  The multiplication of names for  different parts of the same feature  such as a river or mountain range,  should be avoided. Only one name  should be applied to a stream or  mountain range throughout its entire length; n the case oi a river the  name should follow up its longest  branch.  The naming of forks, prongs  branches, etc, as "East Fork," Or  "North Prong," of a river, should be  avoided unless there is special reason for it.

JUVENILE COURTS TO  BE PROVIDED FOR ALL  C0UNTIES_0F STATE  SENATOR HUDSON'S BILL IS FOR  THE BENEFIT OF ALL COUNTIES—STOKES BILL PROVIDES  ONLY FOR PENSACOLA, TAMPA AND JACKSONVILLE—MATTER CAUSING MUCH INTEREST.  TALLAHASSEE, Fla., April 11.  There will be introduced in the Senate two bills providing for juvenile  courts. Senator F. M. Hudson, of  Miami, is the author of one of these,  which is a state-wide measure, and  the other, which applies only to the  cities of Jacksonville, Tampa and  Pensacola, will probably be presented by Senator John P. Stokes, of  Pensacola, who has been requested to  do so. The latter measure is one  which was agreed upon after several  conferences in Jacksonville by the  advocates of juvenile courts from the  three cities mentioned in    the bill.  Mr. Hudson's bill provides for ju-  ! venile courts in every county in the1  I State.     During  Monday  several  conferences were held in an effort to decide upon one of the two bills or a  new bill- that would incorporate the  purposes   of   both   the   others,     but  these  failed  and it  is  now  thought  that both the state-wide measure as  well as the one applying only to the  three large cities of the State will go  before the Senate, be referred to the  same committee and there something  will   be  agreed   upon  and    reported;  back to the upper house.    Maybe all  new, committee bnl will b;e prepared.  The one now in the hands of Mr.  Stokes is  said to be satisfactory to  the advocates  of  juvenile  courts  in  I Jacksonville,   Tampa   and   Pensacola,  but Mr. Hudson thinks that his bill  will answer all purposes with possi*  bly j^Fbw; amendments, and theXwi^LJ  iably both be introduced.        \    |  ^.ne measure now in the hands 'of  jnator Stokes does not create a newj  court nor does it put the State to any!  more expense worth mentioning.    It j  simply   provides   for     the       county j  jullge of the three counties concern- j  edj  to   take   care   of   the   trying   of  children under the age of sixteen and  fojr the apointment by the governor  pi  a  probation officer,  in  whose  jurisdiction some of the juvenile offenders   will   be   referred.    The   defendants may be sentenced to the Reform  &gt;chool at  Marianna  if the judge so  ^ees fit, or they may be placed in the  ire  of  some  party  or  parties  who  ill act as guardians for them.    The  Jill  does  not  create a new  tribunal  but simply amplify the duties of the  |judge.  The supporters of these courts be-  llieve  Mr.   Hudson's   to   be   an   excellent   measure   but   they  fear   that  it  |cannW be passed  because of  its. being st^te-wide and therefore necessitating  the   employment  of  a  prob-^  ,o\i   office in   each  county.  -X c^SttiftrrilJ- Here.  Mr. J. H. Sherrill, secret3l*f*of the  iY.   M.   C.   A.   at   Pensacola,   was   in  |Tallahassee   Monday   endeavoring   to  bring   about   an   agreement   between  the various parties having such bills  so  that   only   measure   would   be   introduced,   but   the   result   of   a   con-  re in the morning was that both  v MudsonW  and   the   other     one  would   be   iirtrodue3d   and   the   committed^ to whi&lt; were ref rred,  A ut.

Unscrupulous manufacturers call in the aid of the chemistfs art  to enable them to deceive the credulous "lady of the house"f and  the only remedy is for the "lady11 to learn how to detect his frauds.  This is an age of progress.  We cannot go back to any example of  the past.  Educated women must mark cut new plans for themselves,  cur girls must be taught to recognize the profession of housekeeping as one of the highest, although not necessarily the only one;  but whatever art or accomplishment they may acquire besides, let  them consider that the management of a household is not to be  neglected.  The properly educated housekeeper is not a drudge.  She  has all the forces of nature at her command- gas and electricity  for heat and light, swift steamships and railroads bring her fruits  and vegetables from all climes, the vast praries furnish meat,  game and flour, mechanical skill gives her all kinds of labor-  saving devices, the general prosperity and. improving taste of the  country admit of tasteful decorations of the rooms.  Surely never  did housekeeping present so many charms.  Nevertheless, if we  have not practical knowledge about these forces, we will surely  come to grief sooner or later.   If we are able to employ senrants, F.  it is not easy to find those who know much of these new things,  and to meet the requirements, whether rich or poor, it is necessary  to be able to tell some one else just how and why each step is  taken.  A little actual knowledge wonderfully simplifies things  *and adds interest to the commonest deeds.  The average school  girl thinks that housekeeping requires no more thought than the  I breaking of stones.   It is our duty to teach them better.  Our  Iwork is honorable in proportion to the thought and. intelligence  Iwe put into it.   It is an old idea that one man must do all the  ■thinking and another be always working; one we call a gentleman.

Here a knowledge  of the composition of various foods will enable one to choose and  yet give the family all the constituents needed.  Pew people realize the value of corn meal as an article of d.iet.   (Story here)  It seems a great waste to spend fifteen or twenty hours a week  making pies, cakes and puddings for a family of five or six at a  cost of five dollars for the raw material, when the raw or cooked  fruit for dessert can be obtained for half that amount and the  time of preparation, as well as the fuel, saved.  Cooking schools are doing much, but instruction must go  farther and include the sanitarjr principles and the branches of  domestic economy.  We very much need this sort of instruction introduced in our schools in such form that the practical application will go into the homes.  One of the most puzzling problems  which a housekeeper has to solve , is to learn the quality of the  various food materials which she provides for her family and to  know how to apportion them.  So much has been said on the subject of adulteration in the past few years that the peace of mind  of a conscientious woman is quite gone, and she appeals to the  law makers to protect her family.   It has been the history of  /ery harmful adulteration that as soon as the public became aware  |f the nature of it, its manufacture was stopped, and some new de-  Lce substituted.   The remedy, then, for this kind of fraud, is  tie education of the general public to such an extent that they  m, with some degree of probability, detect any flagrant case of  Alteration or substitution.  Should the Club so desire, I shall read a series of pals on Foods and their adulterations, as my contribution to the  Lstic Science Department in our Club.  i  Florence P.

'*?  On Thursday afternoon, about  sixty members and guests of the  Housekeepers' Club celeb-rated the  twentieth anniversary of its founding.  This is one of the most notable  clubs, as well as the oldest in the  state. It was founded by Miss Flora J  McFarlane of Princeton, N. J. in  1891. In those early days there was  little in the way of social life in  Cocoanut Grove. Miss McFarlane,  realizing the need of some bond  which should bring the women of  the small community closer together  organized a club, which^ she called  the Housekeepers.'  The club, at first was little more  than a woman's exchange. Gradually  it has developed into a power which  is recognized all over the state. The  members are not only famous housewives, but they are also good citizens. They are public-spirited women  who are ably doing their civic duty.  Id an unobtrusive way, they are  doing much for the bette'rment of  the public scnools. The artistic new  building soon to be erected is directly due to their influence.  An off-shoot of the club, the Village Improvement Society, has done  much to improve the appearance of  the streets and has more work outlined for the coming season.  The celebrat on was a gala affair.  All the members and a number of j  guests from Cocoanut Grove, Miami,  Lemon City and Little River wore  their dantiest gowns, in honor of the  occasion.  The clubhouse was effectively decorated with flowers in profusion.:  The tables fully justified the reputation gained by the members as excellent cooks. Though called "the  annual tea," it was in reality a bountiful and delicious supper. Covers-  were laid for sixty.  Owing to the absence of the president, Miss McFarlane, Mrs. John  Gifford presided in her usual charming manner. The note of unconventionally was struck in Mrs. Gif-  ford's short address of welcome. All  ^stood to drink the health of the absent president and then jtined in  the Harvard version of Auld Lang  Syne:  O, we're here because we're here,,  We're here because we're here.  Wre here, we're here, because we're  here,  We're   here,   because   we're   here.  Witty responses to toasts afforded much merriment. Mrs* Rodmond  Smith was introduced as the wife  j of the man who spells his title with  a y, instead of a j.  ^Tiss Hattie Carpenter, responding  to "The Press," caused a ripple of  amusement when she declared that  "officials responsible for public conditions mean well, probably, but are  just born  careless.  Miss Lester, in response to "The  New; Member," told some stories to  illustrate her statement that the call  for a response to a toast came too  late.  Mr. Orrin Smith was called on to  say a word for the minority which  he  represented.  The following verses were read by  Mrs. Easton of Miami, who had written them for the occasion.  To the Housekeepers' Club of Cocoa-  nut Grove, Florida.  Today we) meet  And   warmly" gree,t  The one who did conceive,  Thistwork  and brought  This  power,   we  perceive.

The  science of good  living,  Domestic1 love, and being,  They   first   did   study  well;  Until the art  Became  a  part,  In every home to dwell.

APR 15 191 i  Mrs. John Gifford,  Cocoanut Grove, Florida.  Madam:  I have your letter of April 4f 1911, requesting  further information regarding the Seminole Indians in  Florida.  A blue print is enclosed showing in tabular form  the date of purchase, acreage, amount paid, from whom bb~  tained, description of the land and references to the Acts  carrying the appropriations from which the lands for the  Seminole Indians in Florida were bought.  As the totals  will show $13,307.52 were spent in the purchase of 23,061.72  acres.  This itself would indicate that the land bought  is not of a very desirable character.  In fact, a large  part of it was bought at about 50 cents an acre and the  Office understands that part of the land now owned toy the  Government for these Indians is under water.   Just what  effect the drainage projects now in progress under State  supervision will have on these lands is, to say the least,  |\ I problematical.

EPLY TO THE FOLLOWING  glades,  necessarily it will enhance the  value   of the  lands  owned by the Government for the   Seminole  Indians.  Under the   appropriation found  in the Act of  April  4,   1910  (36  Stats.  L.,  269-274),  for the  relief of  distress among the  Seminole  Indians,   a special agent has been  appointed and has been in the  field for  some time  past conducting investigations with a view of placing before  the   Office the  true  conditions  surrroraiding these  Indians, with re  commendations as to   such relief,   if any,  as may be required  and can be extended to them.       From preliminary reports from  s  It  this Special Agent, Mr. Lorenzo D. Creel, whose last address  as given to the Office was Jupiter, Florida, the Office  understands that none of the Seminole Indians are permanently  located on the lands heretofore purchased by the Government;  but that occasionally they do go to various points within  these lands for temporary camping purposes at certain seasonr  of the year. L*  Special Agent Creel will make further investigation regarding the needs of these Indians and the Office L  may be in a position at a later date to furnish you with  more definite information as to what policy it expects to  pursue in connection with this band.  Your interest in their  behalf is appreciated.  Respectfully,  A^^yyy^s  4-VAR-10 Commissioner.

Madam:  I have received your letter of March 18, 1911,  regarding a proposed petition for the establishment of a  Federal reservation for the Seminole Indians in Florida.  During the years 1895 to 1900, from money appropriated bty Congress for this purpose, approximately 23,000  acres in southern Florida, lying in townships 47 and 48 south,  ranges 32, 33 and 34 east, were purchased for these Indians.  On November 22, 1907, the Department approved a recommendation from this Office withdrawing from settlement and  entry about 480 acres additional lying in townships 50  and 51 south, ranges 40 and 41 east.  There is, therefore,  at this time an area of a little more than 23,500 acres  set aside for the Seminole Indians in Florida, and these  lands in effect constitute a reservation for these Indians.  The Act of April 4, 1910 (36 Stat.

These Indians have heretofore been averse to having  any dealings with white persons, especially any one connected with the Government Service.  It has not been possible, therefore, to compile an accurate census, but from  the best information obtainable the Seminole Indians in  Florida number about 500.  Through the kindly interest of Bishop Gray and his  co-laborers in southern Florida, these Indians are beginning  to stand in less fear of white men.  Recently a Special Agent  has noeen  appointed for the purpose of more closely investigating and supervising local conditions among these Indians.  After careful investigation now being made under my personal  direction, should it be found that these Indians require  additional lands for the protection of their interests,  the matter will be considered with a view of acquiring  such additional area as may be needed and can be obtained.  Any petition that workers in behalf of the Seminoles  in Florida ma.;/ care to present may be addressed to the  Secretary of the Interior or the Commissioner of Indiam  Affairs.  I thank you for the interest manifested in the welfare  of these Indians and assure you that they will be protected  to the fullest possible extent. y  Respectfully,      /     --^____  3-0GP-27 Commissioner.	88215364 Bytes	4880	6024	449602163	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510104011.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1746	1746	1747.jp2	/asm0400/image/1747.jp2

The present officers  of the club are: President, Mrs.  Franklin Coleman Bush, who founded the club, Vice-President, Miss  Eleanor Corson Percy; Treasurer,  Mrs. Charles Terrell; Corresponding  Sec'y, Mrs. Geo. Romfh; Recording  Sec y, Miss Elizabeth Owen.  The aim of the club is the better-  understanding and appreciation of  music. Next Beason, the club proposes to bring at least two great artists to Miami for concerts, believing that as much, if not more, Inspiration comes to the student and  lover of music through hearing master performers as in personal study.  Membership in the club is not limited to those whot can play upon instruments or sing, but also includes  all those who love good muse and  who desire to know about it from  historical, theoretical and practical  standpoints.  The club seems to have rilled a  long-felt want with Miamians and  much interest and enthusiasm has  been manifested. The future should  witness the development of the Music Club into a powerful organization.  The following subjects have been  studied at programs this winter;  1. Beginnings of Music, in charge  of Mrs. John Gifford. Illustrations  were primitive Indian melod::es, rhyth-|  mic monodies, a Pindar ode, ancient  Breton Balads, very early Scotch and  German Folk  Songs,  etc.  2. Development of Musical Notation, illustrated with charts, Mrs.'  J.  F. H. Mullett.  3. Development of Musical Instruments, Mrs. A. Leight Monroe;  program of various instrumental  numbers; talk on Folk Songs, illustrated, "Summer is Coming In",  with explanations of this earliest  part song by Miss Eleanor Percy,  sung by six voices.  4. Oratorio Program, in conjunc-:  tion with Woman's Club.    In charge  of  Mrs.   Franklin     Coleman     Bush;  illustrations from J. S. Bach, Haydn,!  Handel and Mendelssohn.  5. Dance Forms; Mrs. T. V.  Moore; Illustrations from old dance  songs, piano and violin numbers.  6\ Sonata Form; Mrs. Franklin  C. Bnsh, joint program with Woman's Olub; illustrations from Carl  P. E. Bach, Haydn, Mozart and  3eethoven,  7. Chinese Music. Mrs, John  Gifford; Illustrated by Chinese Melodies and Chinee phonographic records.

Principles adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names (page 144)					Written on front: "1911"; "144"; Printed on clipping: "Geographic Names"; "Principles"; "Adopted March 6, 1906"				1911	1910-1920			eng		University of Miami Libraries.

The following principles have been  adopted by the United States Board  on Geographic Names for guidance in  the selection of place names.  Principles.  Euphonious and suitable names of  Indian, Spanish, or French origin  should be retained.  Names suggested by peculiarities of  the topographic features designated—  such as their form, vegetation, or animal life—are generally acceptable,  but duplication of names, especially  within one State, should be avoided.  The names ''Elk," "Beaver," "Cottonwood," and "Bald" are altogether too  numerous.  Names of living persons should be  applied very rarely, and only those of  great effhin/ence should be thus honored. No personal names should be  attached because of relationship,  friendship, or personal interest, nor  should names of obscure persons be  given. Names of eminent men now  dead may be thus perpetuated, particularly those., of early explorers,  naturalists, geologists, topographers,  etc.  Long and clumsily-constructed  names and names composed of two  or more words should be avoided. It  is a foregone conclusion that such  names will not be adopted by the  public. If the name selected consists  of more than one word the words  should be combined if practicable.  The possessive form of names should  be avoided unless the object is owned  by the person whose name it bears.  The multiplication of names for different parts of the same feature, such  as a river or mountain range, should  be avoided. Only one name should  be applied to a stream or mountain  range throughout its entire length ; in  the case of a river the name should  follow up its longest branch.  The naming of forks, prongs,  branches, etc., as "East Fork" or  "North Prong" of a river, should be  avoided unless there is special reason  for it. In most cases, independent  names should be given to a river's  branches.  The use of hyphens and diacritic  characters should be avoided as far as  possible.  Adopted March 6, 1906.	88373072 Bytes	4963	5934	1153979693	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510106001.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1748	1748	1749.jp2	/asm0400/image/1749.jp2

Place names for South Florida (page 146)					Written on front: "1911"; "146"; Printed on clippings: "Place names for South Florida by Dr. John Gifford"				1911	1910-1920			eng		University of Miami Libraries. Special Collections	Woman's Club of Coconut Grove Records	ASM0400										asm0400000151						asm04000001510108001		/*(&gt;  Place Names for South Florida  By DR. JOHN GIFFORD  Dr. John Gifford  AJOW that many '  new settlements  are forming in  South Florida,  the selection of  appropriate  place names  is important.  Places are often  named offhand  without due reflection, in a  short time; in  fact, even at a public meeting one  man may dominate it and a name is  settled upon which may cling to the  place for ages and be printed thousands of times on maps, on letters,  time tables, etc. If it is a long name,  hard to spell and hard to pronounce,  school children and other people as  well, will have to wrestle with it for  time to come.  In selecting names for places sev-  eral should be proposed and the recommendations of the National Board  of Geographical Names should be  strictly followed. In fact, several  names should be selected and sent to  this board and the Post Office Department for them to choose the one  best suited. This board was appointed for this very purpose, and it  is unfortunate that their recommendations have not been followed in every instance.  There are many reasons why this  board should have a hand in the selection of all place names. Not only  does the Post Office Department  throughout the land have to decipher  &nd interpret thece names in bad  handwritings, but these names have  to go down the ages in the many official maps which are being, from time  to time, revised and reprinted. The  recommendations of this board are  reasonable. For instance, no name  should be selected which is already in  use as a place name in the United  States. Place names should not be  hyphenated; should be short; easily  spelled; easily pronounced and, if possible, should have local color and fitness.  It is a mistake to name a place for  a person unless he is a very distinguished individual, and then his  name should not be used if it is long,  ugly in sound and hard to spell or  pronounce.  It is a mistake to name a place in  Florida, Detroit, Princeton, Chicago or  Philadelphia. It is a mistake to name  a place Smithville, although even the  name Smith with a euphonious suffix  or prefix, may be converted into an  acceptable place name, as in the case  of  Lady  Smith   of   Boer  War  fame.  There is a town in the west coast  called Naples, but if it is so-called because of any resemblance to Naples of  the old world it would be hard to  find it.  It often seems that places are  sometimes purposely inappropriately  named. There is a place on Key  Largo called Klondyke. It is located  on Largo Sound, near Garden Cove.  Largo Sound and Garden Cove are  both good names, but the appropriateness of Klondyke would be hard to  guess.  Fortunately, Florida has many place  names which could not be improved  upon, for instance, Tampa, Ocola,  Miami, etc. With a richness of plant  names, fish names, bird names, Spanish names, Indian names, etc., there is  no lack of fitting material to draw  from. There is no excuse for quickly  and accidentally stamping an unfit  name on any neighborhood.  Give a man an inappropriate first  name and it will very likely die with  him, but posterity must be considered  in the selection of place names.  The story is told of the Italian girl  whose last name was Agony. At the  suggestion of a joking American they  gave her Constant for a first name.  She grew to womanhood with the  name of Constant Agony. She won  out in the end, however, by marrying  a man named Joy.  In case a person's name is used it  may be helped in many cases by using  the termination "glade" just as the  suffix "down" is so frequently used in  England.  There is a little place south of  Miami called originally Cocoplum because so many cocoplum bushes grew  on the beach. The beach is still  called Cocoplum beach, the school  Cocoplum school, the cemetery Cocoplum cemetery, but the name of the  post office and station was changed to  Larkin. The Board of Geographical  Names at Washington might change  it back to Cocoplum.  Indian names are often too long,  but Ojus is a sample of a good short  one. It means something, too—it is  the Seminole for "plenty." I doubt  if there is another town in the whole  world of the same name, and a letter  with Ojus on it is pretty sure to get  to Ojus, Florida, in the course of  time.  Most colored settlements are just  called "colored town," and I think  Kirk Munroe named the Coconut  Grove colored town "Kebo," the name  of a town in Africa. No doubt there  are thousands of similar short, well  fitting African names which might be  applied to settlements of the colored  race. A large proportion of these  negroes are from the Bahamas, and  towns might be named for the islands  \	86569536 Bytes	4928	5854	2579054809	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510108001.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1753	1753	1754.jp2	/asm0400/image/1754.jp2

The wagon containing the  lion's cage got stuck in mid stream.  The elephant was brought back to  help push the lion wagon out of the  water. The natives watched the proceeding with great interest and the  spot is now known v"as-the-place-  where - the - elephant -helped-the-lion-  cross-over." No doubt some of our Indian names have similar meaning.  Some are long enongh to mean a lot;  for instance, the term Okaloacoochee  slough is too cumbersome for common  use.  Of course, there are few names that  have no faults and the spirit of this  article is not to criticise, but mainly  to advocate more care in name selections. Take the name Coconut  Grove, of which the citizens are proud,  and who guard the identity of the  place with so much care. It is often  spoken of as "The Grove" for short.  In fact, Cocopalm Grove would be accurate, and since there is no great  area of cocopalms in grove form in  sight, it would probably be just as  well, if not better and easier, to call it  Cocopalm, were it not for the associations which cluster round the name,  although more and more people will  call it "The Grove" for short until in  time it may become its accepted name.  Silver Palm is a good name, also  Pompano, Lantana, Flamingo, etc.  Many place names are corruptions or  even mistakes, for instance, one might  supoose that Key West means the  westernmost key, but there are keys  to the west of it, and the term is a  corruption of the Spanish Cayo  Hueso, meaning bone key.  Buena Vista is a pretty Spanish  name, but badly worn. There is  hardly a state in the Union without  two or three Buena Vistas. This  name is usually applied in districts as  flat as pancakes. One town in New  Jersey of this name dropped the vista  and is now known as Buena. Miramar  and Esperanza are two common Spanish names which have not yet been  extensively worked in this country.  Such subdivisions as Evanston  Heights and Evanton Heights can  hardly merit the term of heights. To  be sure, these places are higher than  some other places, but it is surely  stretching the term to dignify a place  less than twenty-five feet above sea  level with the term heights. .  This reminds me of the man who  called his place "The Bluff," although  it was as level as a lake. When people inquired about it he explained  that the bluff was in the name.  The term glade in combination with  euphonious plant names appeals to  many people; for instance, the term  "Orangeglade" is very popular. Wil-  lowglade, Palmglade, Guavaglade,  etc., sound just as well. The meanings of such terms as Allapattah and  Pocomoonshine are hard to explain.  Some old settler may know the origin  of these names. A-la-pattah is the  Spanish for by-the-leg, or to catch  one foul in a wrestle, now an idiom  meaning to take advantage of a person in any way. It is hardly likely  that this could be its meaning. I  have heard it said also that Allapattah  is the Indian for alligator. "Poco"  means "little," and moonshine  "whisky." I doubt if this could be  the meaning of the term. Both of  these terms may be negro corruptions  of something else, just as Gumbo-  limbo is a corruption of Gum Elemi,  and alligator Pear a corruption of  Avocado or&gt; Aquacate. There is no  limit to the way a negro can corrupt a  name; for instance, the Girasole artichoke was very quickly called the  Jerusalem artichoke in Louisiana.  There are, in fact, almost five hundred miles of pretty good names from  the St. Mary's River to Tortugas.  There are more town names to the  population on the East Coast than in  any other part of the United States.  There are French, English, Spanish,  Indian and even Japanese town  names. Of all this list there are few,  if any, that are objectionable. This  should make us all the more careful  in future selections.  There is a lot in a name after all.  If a place has few natural attractions  or is naturally unattractive, it is heaping injury on top of insult to give it  an unattractive name. The Pullman  Palace Car Company consider it worth  while to hire a person to name their  cars. Big money is often paid for a  suggestive name, because of its advertising value. A large prize was  given the person who suggested the  name "Black Diamond Express." In  many patent medicines the name alone  is patented. In the case of a hotel  it is a very valuable asset. The same  applies to a town. How would lots  sell in a place called Hellneck, Toad-  town, Skunktown, Agueville, Flea-  ville or Ticktown, although the names  might be appropriate, easy to pronounce and easy to spell?

Special Collections	Woman's Club of Coconut Grove Records	ASM0400										asm0400000151						asm04000001510111001		REPORT   OF   BOARD   ON   GEOGRAPHIC   NAMES.  23  In order to secure uniformity in so far as possible in the matter of  transliteration of Chinese place names and in order that the system  adopted may conform to what is apparently to be the standard in  American publications, it is recommended that the following rules be  adopted for observance, viz:  (1) The spelling generally shall follow the Wade system, but no  attempt shall be made to modify established foreign local usage, and  the English form of a name as printed in the Imperial Maritime Customs Trade Reports shall be conclusive as to local usage.  (2) The diacritical marks u»cd in the Wade system shall be omitted.  (3) Names shall be p^ifed as single words.  (4) Form- auctioned by long usage in standard publications in the  -p^nsh language shall be retained.  /ym  CONCLUSION.  The Board again respectfully calls attention to the fact that it is  without means for carrying on its work, save by the courtesy of the  bureaus, offices, and institutions represented in its membership.

A few informal meetings and discussions were held and literature and  data bearing on the subject obtained.  As a result an association has been  formed, with constitution as follows:  Constitution.  Article I. The name of this society shall be The Cocoanut Grove  Humane Society.  Art. II. Its object shall be the  prevention of cruelty to animals by  all proper means, and the preventing of all cruelty by humane education  and  otherwise.  Art. III. There shall be nothing  in its management to interfere with  its receiving the full support of all  good men and women of all parties  and religious opinions whatsoever.  Art. IV. Any adult person may  become a member of this society by  the payment of 25 cents per annum.  Art. V. Its officers shall be a  president, vice president, secretary,  treasurer and an executive committee, elected by the society and to  serve one year or until their successors shall  be elected.  Art| VI. Meetings of the society  shail be held at such times and  places as the society or executive  committe shall appoint.  The line of work proposed is largely educational, especially arousing interest among the children by forming  "Bands of Mercy." There has been  a large amount of excellent literature  published by the "Massachusetts Society for Prevention of Cruelty to  Animals" and the "American Humane Education  Society,"  and every  band of 30 children may obtain free  of cost the paper called "our Dumb  Animals," published by these societies besides many other leaflets,  by signing the following simple pledge: "I will try to be  kind to all living creatures and try  to  protect  them  from  cruel  usage."  The badges and the melodies supplied together with appropriate talks  and recitations have proved very popular wherever used.  The Cocoanut Grove society hopes  that every member will help gather  groups of children into Bands of  Mercy.  At the initial meeting of the society a committee was appointed to  investigate the existing state laws  regarding cruelty to animals and the  powers of our county officials as to  arrest and prosecution. An abstract  of the most important laws has been  compiled from the Florida statutes  as follows:  Cruelty to Animals.  Sec. 3395. Whoever unnecessarily overloads, overdrives, tortures, torments, deprives of necessary sub-  stenance or shelter, or unnecessarily  or cruelly beats, mutilates or kills  any animal, or causes the same to be  done, or carries in or upon any vehicle, or otherwise, any animal in a  cruel or inhuman manner, shall be  punished by imprisonment not exceeding six months, or by fine not  exceeding one hundred dollars.  Confinement of Animals.  Sec. 3396. Whoever confines or  impounds any animal in any place and  fails to supply the same during such  confinement with a sufficient quantity of good and wholesome food and  water,  or who  keeps any  animal  in	51816700 Bytes	3605	4789	1823144795	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510112011.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1758	1758	1759.jp2	/asm0400/image/1759.jp2

Killing  an Animal  When Useless.  Sec. 3159. In case any horse,  mule or cow or other domestic animal shall be so injured or diseased  as to be utterly useless and of no  value to the owner, and is in a suffering condition and it shall appear  by the certificate of a veterinary surgeon that such animal can not be  cured or rendered fit for service, it  shall be lawful for the city or town  marshall or chief of police, upon application of the officer of any society  for the prevention of cruelty to animals, to cause such animal to be immediately killed, and it shall he his  duty to see that it is done.  Contagious Diseases.  Sec. 3400.

A leaflet setting forth the aims of  the society and the most important of  the laws will be printed for general  distribution.  The sheriff and deputies have cordially welcomed the founding of this  society and have promised prompt  and thorough co-operation whenever  notified of any case needing attention. They state that such an association will aid them both morally  and materially in seeing that the  laws are strictly enforced.  The present officers of the society  are: President, Mrs. Chas. I. DeGarmo; vice-president, Mr. J. W. Asbury; secretary, Mrs. I. H. Adams,  treasurer,  Mr.  R. L.  Stewart.  Executive committee: Miss Steere,  Miss Lester, Mr. Carney, Mrs. De-  Guisselle, Mr. Samuel Harrif, Mrs.  R. L. Stewart.  The society decided to become a  branch member of the "Massachusetts Society for prevention of Cruelty to Animals," thus entitling it to  all the publications of this society  which for over 40 years has been  one of the most active humane societies in the United States, having  been the means of circulating over  three million copies of ''Black Beauty" in a dozen, or more languages.  Aside from the membership dues  of the Cocoanut Grove Society, donations are, of course, welcome so  that a sufficient fund may be secured to carry on an active propaganda.  Dues and contributions may be  sent to the treasurer, Mr. R. L.  Stewart, Cocoanut Grove.	51295976 Bytes	3568	4790	2517150912	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510112021.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1759	1759	1760.jp2	/asm0400/image/1760.jp2

Her earliest recollection was of suiting, with her little twin brother,  Chin Wah, in her grandfather's sunny  garden, which ran close down to the  big, blue Han River, and watching thi  boats of every imaginable color and  size, as they floated down to the great  Yangtse Kiang. The little maiden's  grandfather, Chin Wah Ton, was  known as a rich man in those parts.  He had two great rice fields, a tobacco plantation, an orchard of cherries,  and a comfortable house, on the roof  of which was a most wonderful garden, full of fat cabbages and fresh-  smelling leeks. He was a man ojf  much influence, and many came to  seek his advice and instructions. At  one time he had been a kuan, and  ever since had carried an added  prestige and dignity. His learning  and piety were famed all through the  province, even so far away as the  great city of Wuchang, where he  made a journey in his richly-upholstered palanquin twice every year to  sell the merchants there the products  of his lands.  In one particular only had he ever  been unfortunate. He had three  wives and many children; but, despite his piety, the children had all  been girls, save one. Chin Wah Ton  hated girls, and his whole affection  was lavished upon this son. Upon  him would depend not only the responsibility of maintaining the family  name, but the more important duty of  performing those annual ceremonials  at the grave of his father, through  which aid alone the soul of Chin Wah  might hope to rest in peace.  The son grew and prospered; but  alas! when he had been married but  three years, he fell sick and died.  The grief of the father was piteous to  see; but in the midst of his sorrow  there was one hope. The son had  himself had a son, the little twin'  brother of Li Po Ton, who had been  named after his grandfather, Chin  Wah Ton. So it came about that the  little Chin Wah became the light and  joy of his grandfather's eyes—his one  hope and happiness.  Two more contented children would  be hard to find than these little twins  of Hupeh. All the long, sunny days  they flitted about like gay butterflies	49686080 Bytes	3817	4337	2806963044	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510115091.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1762	1762	1763.jp2	/asm0400/image/1763.jp2

To be sure, when one of the brilliant  butterflies sailed temptingly through  the air and Chin Wah rushed after it  in gay pursuit, little Li Pon Ton was  left far behind in the chase, for her  poor bound feet refused to carry her,  and when she tried to run they ached  piteously. There were many othur  games in which she found herself distanced, but little Chin Wah was  patient and good, and she was happy  —innocent, sweet little Li Po Ton!  Yet there was another grief which  sometimes sent a quick, sharp pain  through her little child heart; for she  had not been slow to notice that her  grandfather, the great Chin Wah, had  plenty of caresses and words of affection for her twin brother, but paid no  more attention to her than if she had  been one of the cabbages in his garden.    Why was it so?   We shall see.  One day she missed little Chin  Wah, and although she hunted all  through the garden, he was nowhere  to be found. At last he came running  out of the house, his eyes shining and  his face all aglow with excitement,  but when he saw Li Po standing  pleased and glad in the shadow of a  rose-bush, he drew himself up in an  affected attitude of superiority and  looked scornfully at her.  "Oh, ho!" he exclaimed. "I can't  play with you any more. I have just  had my first lesson in reading, and  a man is coming every day to teach  me more. I am going to be a great  man, like grandfather, and ride in a  palanquin, but you can't learn to read.  Grandfather said so.    You are a girl."  Poor little maid! For the first time  she saw the barrier between them.  The next day, when she cautiously  peeped through the door and saw  Chin Wah standing straight and  proud before a strange man, who was  showing him curious figures on a strip  of red paper, she seemed to realize  at once that the happy playtime had  gone forever. If there had been any  hope left in her mind that the good  times might return, it was effectually dispelled when, a little later, on  the day of the great annual festival,  she saw little Chin Wah ready to go  with his grandfather to see the ceremonies. Little girls, and big ones,  too, for that matter, always stayed at  home, but it was a grand gala day for  the boys. After the manner of his  countrymen, Chin Wah was clad in a  suit entirely new. Very wonderful, Li  Po Ton thought it. Indeed, with his  wide trousers of bright green silk, his  tunic of blue brocade, bound with  white silk and covered with gold embroidery,    his     purple    embroidered	50030680 Bytes	3832	4350	4190147795	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510115101.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1763	1763	1764.jp2	/asm0400/image/1764.jp2

He caught sight of his little sister and  threw her another of his scornful  glances. It was then she knew the  barrier between them could never be  crossed.  After that she passed her time  curled up on a cushion by her mother's side, learning to sew and to embroider. Her only pleasure was the  hour she walked in the garden. Although she had no companion, and  her poor feet could only hobble, yet  the bright skies, the familiar blue  river and the old cherry trees were  restful to her sight, and filled her  mind with something akin to peace  and contentment.  One day, when she was twelve  years old, her grandfather sent for  her. She found him sitting cross-  legged on the floor opposite a strange  man, who wore the most wonderful  queue she had ever seen. As he sat  on his cushion it lay on the floor like  a great snake and seemed to reach  half across the floor. Both were  smoking long pipes, and neither  seemed to see her as she entered.  She stood before them motionless  and with downcast eyes. Without  speaking, Chin Wah motioned her to  stand nearer his guest. She could  not    tell    why,    but    somehow    this  stranger, with his fierce black eyes,  filled her with terror, and she felt  that his presence boded her no good.  Cold chills ran up and down her back  as he tapped her on the head, examined her feet, felt of her arms, shoulders and legs.  "Pretty girl; good girl," grunted  Chin Wah.  Indeed, she was a pretty sight, with  her plump pink cheeks, soft black  eyes, and delicate mouth filled with  sharp white teeth; but she had never  heard this before.  "Ugh!" exclaimed the stranger.  "No good;  too fat;  too little."  With another gesture from Chin  Wah, Li Po Ton was sent from the  room. What could it mean, this new  mystery? She ran straight to her  mother and told her what had happened. But the mother knew nothing.  She could guess, however. She knew  how Chin Wah hated girls. She was  familiar with his grasping disposition,  and had heard his grumblings when  he paid the marriage portion of each  of his many daughters. It was not  unlikely he thought to gain something  from his granddaughter, whom he  had always treated with contempt.  Gently as she could, she told the  maiden what she feared it might  mean, and together they wept. Disentangling herself from her mother's  arms, Li Po crept back to the door of  the reception room, and cautiously  peeped    within.      The    stranger   was	50375328 Bytes	3852	4357	2160466989	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510115111.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1764	1764	1765.jp2	/asm0400/image/1765.jp2

With her heart filled with  terror, Li Po Ton flew back to her  mother and fell at her feet in a spasm  of agonized weeping.  Soon Chin Wah called her again,  and, bidding her say good-bye to her  mother, told her she was to go away  with the stranger. Chinese children  of both sexes are taught filial respect  and obedience to a remarkable degree, and Li Po Ton had no thought  to question whither she was going, or  why. With a dull, heavy pain in her  heart, she was placed in the palanquin by the side of the strange man.  All day long they traveled and the  little girl sat as still as a mouse,  speaking not a word. At night they  went on board a boat. Li Po was  put into a bunk, where, with her head  buried in the blankets, she quietly  cried herself to sleep. In a day or  two they came in sight of a great city;  and the noise and confusion, so  new to her, abstracted her attention  to the exclusion of her own misery.  Then they were carried to the biggest ship she had ever seen, and she  was put to bed in a berth several feet  from the floor. All around her were  other passengers, and not a few girls  near her own age, who seemed also  to belong to the stranger. With these  she might have found companionship,  but soon the rocking of the ship sent  them all to bed, and the dreadful seasickness made her forget all else.  The time seemed interminable, with  no one to comfort or say one word of  cheer. She wondered in vain to what  strange land she might be going, for  the stranger guardian had never seen  fit to give her any information as to  her destination. Had she known how  to pray she would have prayed for  death. As it was, she looked through  the round port-hole windows at the  rolling, foam-capped waves, and  longed to bury all her sorrows beneath them forever.  Well might she make this wish, for  Li Po Ton was a slave. At last they  came to land, and she was led down  the gang-plank into a great crowd of  shouting, noisy people. Some men  with a strange dress of blue cloth and  brass buttons hustled her away into a  dark, gloomy room where there were  many Chinamen and a few Chinese  girls. There they stood, glancing  timidly about them, with the same  hunted look in their faces that she  felt must be in her own. She longed  to speak to them; perhaps they could  tell her where they were; but she  saw the fierce eyes of the stranger  upon her and she dared not.  There was a great deal of talking  in a strange language, a great many  questions asked and answered, a  showing of white tickets—all a mystery to her. Then she was hurried  again into the street, and with all the	50221556 Bytes	3827	4372	2172531482	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510115121.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1765	1765	1766.jp2	/asm0400/image/1766.jp2

It all interested, but it terrified  her. At last they got off the car, tlie  stranger leading, or rather driving  them down a dark, narrow alley.  Here she felt more at home, for the  people were her own countrymen, although they stared at them in an uncomfortable manner. The stranger  led them into a long low room, already crowded with Chinamen. No  sooner were they inside than a big,  fat man, whom the others called Wah  Lee, shouted:  "Which is my girl?"  "This is the girl I bought for you,"  said the stranger, as he pointed to Li  Po Ton. "Three hundred dollars is  her price."  After a thorough examination of her  person, which satisfied him that she  was sound and a good bargain, Wah  Lee counted out the gold, and taking  the little girl by the hand, led her  down the street.  Through alley after alley they  passed until they came to the door of  a little tumble-down, dark-looking  building. Wah Lee opened the door  and thrust her inside, locking the door  after her.  Here there were other women, her  own China women. They came and  took her by the hand, patted her on  the "back, smoothed her cheek, and  looked into her eyes with sympathy.  There  were  young girls  like herself,  and there was one woman who made  her think of her own mother. The  room was low and narrow. Bunks  rested against the wall on one side.  There was just room for three bunks  from floor to ceiling, and just room  for two tiers placed end to end.  Between the bunks and the opposite  wall was a space about three feet in  width. The only furniture was six  blue-painted wooden stools. There  was a door and one tiny square window, securely cross-barred with iron  like the windows of a penitentiary.  It was no pleasure to look out at this  window, for there was nothing but  the dark alley to look into, enlivened  only by an occasional passing Chinaman. As these passers-by never  failed to stare through the iron bars  to grin at them, there was no particular need of peering out for the  sake of seeing them.  In response to the queries of these  new friends, Li Po Ton related all the  details of her journey, described her  home and early life, and then plied  them with the eager questions which  for so long a time had been uppermost  in her mind: "Why are we here?  What does it mean?"  The women looked from one to another, and hesitated. Just then Wah  Lee brought in their supper of boiled  cabbage and rice. Li Po Ton was  hungry, and ate heartily. When her  appetite was satisfied the new master bade her climb to the top berth.	50460436 Bytes	3849	4368	2692606045	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510115131.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1766	1766	1767.jp2	/asm0400/image/1767.jp2

After breakfast, the next morning,  the master locked the door, as usual,  and went away. Seated upon their  wooden stools again, there was nothing to do but talk. Little by little,  the women acquainted the new-comer  with her fate. They told her she  would not be permitted to rest another night.  "But," she said, "can we not run  away?"  "Run away?" one of the women replied. "The door is always locked;  and there is no place to go. Besides,  the master told us once of a woman  who ran away, and when they found  her they boiled her alive in hot lard."  All day the little maid sat stupefied  with horror.  Li Po Ton was one of the twelve  hundred Chinese women slaves in the  city of San Francisco. After supper  that night, Wah Lee made her go to  bed again, and she climbed up to her  berth. Soon he returned, bringing  with him a group of men. One placed  a piece of money in his hand, and was  bidden to climb up to her berth.  When he had gone another came, and  then another, until the poor girl had  fainted. Night after night the experience was repeated. Sometimes  she   screamed;    but   Wah   Lee   only  bound her mouth, and gave her no  breakfast. And this was in the land  that boasts liberty to be the inalienable right of every individual.  Many weeks passed. The pink  faded from her cheeks. Her eyes had  grown heavy and dull, and dark  circles surrounded them. Wah Lee  observed the change, and bade her eat  more rice and cabbage.  One night, at a late hour, the room  was deserted. Her sisters in misery  were asleep. She could hear their  heavy breathing. Wah Lee had gone,  leaving the door slightly ajar. It had  never happened before. Hastily slipping on her tunic, and bunching up  the blankets to look as if they covered her sleeping form, she climbed  down to the floor. Outside all was  blackness, but voices could be heard  at one end of the alley. Closing the  door behind her, she stepped into the  street, and in the shadow hurried  away. On she went, she knew not  and cared not where. Once her heart  stood still, and a memory of the woman who had been boiled in lard flitted across her mind, as she found herself close to a group of Chinamen;  but she slunk back into a dark corner and held her breath. They passed  by, and as fast as her poor, deformed  feet could carry her, she hurried on.  Where could she go? What could  she do? If only there might be some  little dark corner, some forgotten  spot,   where   no   human   being   would	50549828 Bytes	3847	4378	2393060447	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510115141.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1767	1767	1768.jp2	/asm0400/image/1768.jp2

To  starve in peace was the boon she  craved.  The darkness was lifting, and it  would soon be morning. Not a moment must be lost. With feet racked  with pain she turned a corner and  entered what seemed to be another  dark alley. Hurrying on, she  stumbled, and fell prostrate to the  ground. It was some time before she  could rise, and when she did so the  gray dawn of the coming day enabled  her to see her surroundings. It was  a rough enclosure, filled with all sorts  of debris. Sitting on the ground, she  spied a little hole which seemed to  invite her to enter. This might do.  Creeping on her hands and knees, she  crawled inside. It was an angle  made by a hogshead, the fence, and  two ash-barrels. A wide board partially covered the opening through  which she had crawled. She placed  it so that the opening was entirely  concealed. Oh, if she could only  know she was safe! She unbound  her aching feet, and rubbed them  smartly with her hands, until they  felt relieved. Then, lying down on  the ground, with a block for a pillow,  she fell asleep.  She was aroused once by voices  near her hiding-place. Not a breath  or movement betrayed her. How still  she was, her eyes starting from her  head, her cheek paled with fright!  Poor    hunted    thing!     Then    voice's  came again. This time they had been  preceded by the rumbling of a big  wagon. It was the scavenger who  had come to carry away the ashes.  The barrels were moved. She was  discovered lying there with her face  buried in her hands.   She had fainted.  When she recovered consciousness  she was lying in a clean white bed,  and a kindly-faced woman was bending anxiously over her. Fortunately,  her feet had led her to the very door  of the "Home for the Friendless," and  if ever there was a creature who  needed such protection, it was little  Li Po Ton. The woman at her side  was Mrs. Miller, the matron. But  the little Chinese girl was afraid of  Americans. She had suffered so  cruelly in their land, she thought they  must all be wicked. She turned her  face away, and wept bitterly. Food  was brought, but she would not eat.  An interpreter was sent for, a German, who had lived many years in  China, and who was renowned among  tourists as the best guide to the Chinese quarters in the city. He was  supposed to know every Chinaman  and China woman in San Francisco;  but Li Po Ton was a new-comer, and  he did not know her. It was a long  time before she could place confidence enough in his friendship to tell  him anything; but at last, in response  to his kind and gentle questions, she  told him the story of her life. Every  word was   translated   to   Mrs. Miller,	50836312 Bytes	3875	4371	577385082	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510115151.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1768	1768	1769.jp2	/asm0400/image/1769.jp2

Somehow, a knowledge of her presence there leaked out. The Chinese  master heard the rumor, and speedily a writ of habeas corpus was issued, to command Mrs. Miller to pre-  duce her charge in court the next  morning. Here was a dilemma. A  lawyer was consulted, but he could  offer little consolation. Wah Lee, he  said, would probably bring Chinese  friends enough to prove that the girl  was his wife, and the court would give  her back to him.  The interpreter was sent for again,  and, as gently as possible, Mrs. Miller  tried to explain the court and the law,  and the  possible  outcome.    But what  did Li Po Ton know of American  courts and habeas corpus acts? She  understood nothing of what was said  except that she would see Wah Lee  the next day, and perhaps would have  to go away with him again. She ate  no supper, and went to bed at an  early hour. Before retiring, the matron stepped into her room. She  semed to be sleeping soundly. The  next morning she looked at her again.  Something strange in her appearance  made her touch the girl's cheek. It  was cold. She turned down the  blankets. The bed was saturated  with blood, and a pen-knife, belonging  to the matron, was plunged into her  heart. Poor, hunted, wrong Li Po  Ton! She had at last found liberty  in death.  Copyright by The Woman's Journal. Published by The Woman's  Journal and the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Association, 585  Boylston street, Boston, Mass.

Friedrich Wilhelm  Raiffeisen was born in 1818. During his  incumbency as Mayor in two country  towns in Germany he noted the oppression of agriculturists by usurers. He  determined to relieve farmers from this  infliction. He established a farmers' cooperative banking organization. It is now  in successful operation in hundreds of  German and Dutch villages. The two  basic principles are that each institution  shall work for one particular community  only, and that the bank shall not consider  its own profit but only the benefit to the  borrower. Thus there is removed the  danger of a possible non-acquaintance  with particular circumstances, as the  sphere of operation is small, and also the  temptation to take undue advantage of  an applicant's difficulties. A definite rate  of interest is charged on all loans. With  the exception of a salary to the cashier,  the banks are managed free of charge.  The directors and managers are well-  known villagers who keep informed as  to the integrity of borrowers and who are  willing to place their business knowledge  at their fellow-citizens' disposal. Another  essential feature is the indivisible fund,  representing the total accumulation of  all profits. When the sum reaches too  high a figure, a general meeting of the  bank's members decides how the excessive income shall be spent, either in raising the percentage paid to depositors or  in acquiring objects and works essential  to the members' welfare. The members  are any persons enjoying a good reputation with legal residence in the community or its immediate neighborhood. Each  village bank must become a stockholder  in a central bank. The Dutch central  bank is appropriately at the centrally located city of Utrecht. The Utrecht bank  works like a clearing-house. All surplus  funds of the local banks are deposited  there, and advances are made to village  banks. These banks are also inspected  and controlled by the central bank. The  Dutch Government grants an annual subsidy to the central bank on condition that  an  official accountant appointed by the  Minister of Agriculture supervises the  administration. Of the village banks connected with the central bank at Utrecht,  not one has thus far suffered any loss.  The Raiffeisen plan, it is evident, contains an idea worthy of transplanting to  this country and to its Territorial possessions.  B  Two   endeavors  THE   SHANGHAI r &gt;\ k*&gt;tt  INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE        l0r       tne       better  understanding of  the Chinese by foreigners and of foreigners by the Chinese deserve chronicling.  Both are educational and are leading to  more intelligent and kindly mutual intercourse between Chinese and foreigners.  The Chinese Government is not unmindful of the desirability, and even necessity,  of foreign help and suggestion, and is  seeking, wherever profitable, the " useful  learning " of the WTest. But let no one  think that the Chinese are not showing  individual independence and energy. The  anti-opium edicts are a proof of this, and  the result is evident in a greater moral  fiber among the men. Moreover, the  anti-foot-binding movement has already  relieved crippled women and enabled them  better to care for their children. Thus, in  order to help China, foreigners, in addition  to a consciousness of the worth of their  own civilization, must appreciate whatever  present progress China is making and  whatever excellence Chinese history discloses. In other words, any patronizing  attitude by otherwise benevolent foreigners will defeat their own ends. Among  the first to adopt an " equal terms policy "  was the Rev. Dr. Gilbert Reid, an American who has long enjoyed an intimate  acquaintance with Chinese of education all  over the Empire. It led to the formation,  years ago, of the International Institute  at Shanghai, a joint stock company. Its  members are Chinese and persons of  other nationalities. As expressed on its  seal, the Institute's ideals are Truth and  Harmony. The irresponsible, deplorable,  and often mendacious newspaper reports  concerning both Chinese and Americans  daily emanating from Shanghai in particular show the desirability of having at that  place some counter-irritant, establishing  truth instead of falsehood. As to harmony, the Institute's practical purpose is,	74684028 Bytes	4094	6079	2424051058	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510118011.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1773	1773	1774.jp2	/asm0400/image/1774.jp2

The boys who are not allowed to shoot  off firecrackers this year will find a very  tantalizing article in St. Nicholas. It tells  just how these "whip guns" are made and  gives pictures of the work and incidentally  of such marvellous strings of crackers as  would make any youngster fairly wriggle  with joy.  Erick Pomeroy, dating his letters from  the "Temple of the Empress of Heaven,"  is responsible for this thorn in the side of  the boy who is to have a safe and sane  Fourth. He says that our diminutive  packs would excite only scorn in a Chinaman, for he uses crackers in great strings  fron thirty to fifty feet long.  The strings are hung from tall poles, a  light hemp twine being woven in with the  fuses so that the string won't fall by its  own weight. To giveit additional strength  it is fastened at intervals to a rope which  runs through a pulley at the top of the pole.  By means of this rope the string is pulled  up till it clears the ground.  As the explosions tear away the crackers the rope is gradually let down and at  the same time held away from the bottom  pole so as to make a graceful curve of the  string. When these long strings have  finally eaten themselves up there are bas-  ketfuls of fragments on the ground which  are first wetted down] to guard against rire  and then swept up or allowed to blow away.  The Chinese have many names for the  different varieties they make. First come  the ordinary "whip guns" or "whips," so  called because the sound of their explosion is like the snapping of a whip. There  are "small whips," about an inch long,  made especially for the little children to  use without; danger. For one American  cent you could buy 100 of these.  Next larger than the "whip  guns" are  the "bursting bamboos," which are said  to have taken their name from the fact  that in  early  times  bamboo  was  used  as the tttbes for   these  crackers.  still more powerful are the "hemp thun-  j derers."   Bearing   a  close  similarity  in  | power to cannon crackers, these have been  ' known at times to break the second story  paper windows in a small compound,  "They play an important part in the  worshipping or propitiating of the gods  in our courtyard," writes Mr. Pomeroy,  "inasmuch as it is considered good form  to set them off at intervals while the whip  guns, which my teacher assures me do  not require any watching, are keeping  up their unbroken stream of praise and  prayer. They may be considered as  good lusty amens throughout the service.  "Slightly different in form are the  i 'double noises,' which are nothing more or  less than our 'boosters' that go off first;  on the ground and again up in the air.  To intersperse these throughout the explosions of the whips during any special  demonstration is also considered good  I form. Then allied to these we find anothe r  booster, which when it explodes on the  ground drives ten others up into the air  to become the 'flying in heaven ten sounds  with the Chinese.  "These are only for play, and that  chiefly in the homes from the 13th to the  17th day of the first moon of the year.  With the"lamp flower exploders,' that is,  our flower-pot, the list of the most common forms of crackers and fireworks  becomes exhausted, although the Chinese  have several other less usual species,  together with many alternative names for  both these and the ones I have mentioned.  "The time when the Chinese receive  most crackers is at the New Year season,  when, among the well-to-do families of  Tientsin and Pekin, it is customary to  give a boy the equivalent of our 50 cents  for his purchases. In Pekin the shops  issue special red notes, like our old 'shin- j  plasters' in value, for this one use at the j  New Year..  "In giving the cracker money to the  boys, the parents often make smaller  presents to the girls, who are wont to buy  paper flowers with their pennies, in proof  &gt;f which the Chinese have a proverb  which runs, 'Girls like flowers; hoys like  smokers.''  *But this juvenile use of the wlup guns  consumes only an infinitesimal part of  the whole supply of the year. Greatest  of all occasions is the passing of the year,  when the people keep up the successor to  the ancient custom of setting off the 'bamboo guns' in order to drive away the evil  spirits of the last, twelvemonth and to  usher in all that is good for the coming  one. All night long the crackers have  been popping in the town below, and an  early gathering in the temple is held to  add the final touch before the new day  shall break.  "When morning; came I .wandered leisurely to my office through the business  section of the town to watch the fun as  the big shops. Never shall I forget the  picture of that street with its dozen or  more great red strings of crackers hanging in front of the bigger hongs and seemingly waiting for some word to start the  fusillade.  "Fortunately this came and the storm  broke as I waited. For sheer nois^  vivacity and demonstrative liveliness 1  never have seen the equal of those snarl*  ing, bursting lin&lt;i;s that poured out theitf  wrath with incessant fervor upon the evil  spirits below and shot up their welcome  to the good ones above.  "Then, although this display on New  Year's Day seemed grand enough to last  a long time, there came more explosions  as the shops took down their doors and  began again their routine business on the  5th or 6th of the moon. Furthermore,  custom1 demands in certain parts that  throughout-the first ten days of the year  there shall be occasional snappings of the  wHips, to be followed on the, 15th, at the  .Feast of Lanterns, by a still greater  demonstration.  "When a new shop is dpened it is customary for all then front boards, to be  left up until just before the opening cere-  hiony takes place. Then one or two boards  are taken down, the manager arid his  assistants come but to light a string of  crackers, and as the whips are snapping  the remaining boards come down to the  sound of this propitious music of the land.  Yery often there are several strings hung  from poles or tripods, and one is lighted  after the other in such a way as to maintain  a long, unbroken stream-of noiser  "In most parts of the empire it is also  customary for an official when he receives  the seals of office from his predecessor  to have a string of crackers let off at the  proper moment. And I must confess to  having yielded myself to the pressure  of my Chinese assistants An having purchased a few for use at the time we opened  our new office at this place. Likewise,  when a military official. is leaving a post  he is usually'ac'ebrded a sendgiff with  ei ackers which have been subscribed for  by his men."  Many of the firecracker makers live in  the same 'street. The faotories are primitive affairs, all the work being done ;by  hand. The first step consists in cutting  into pieces of the right size the rough  brown paper which forms the jacket of  the firecrsLckor.  These make a hollow tube several layers  in thickness and just twice as long as the  finished cracker is to; be. The workman  takes a pile of these cut papers, lays them  out so they are like a flight of steps and  draws his paste brush down this graduated  end of the pile. -  Then he takes one slip, bends the dry  end around an-iron nail and places the  nail under a board which rolls it along  till the slip is all wound up. The pasted  edge fastens the roll, which is then slipped  off the nail and thrown into a basket.  One of the apprentices puts these hollow  tubes together in six sided packages  containing just 507 of them.  When they are dry they receive the  little red paper covers so familiar to us  all. This red paper is already cut into  slips of the right size. A workman rolls  each slip by hand around the brown  tube, and again they are'thrown into a  basket to be,gathered up by the apprentice into the six sided bundles. This  time these are cut exactly in half ?b"y a  big knife, leaving them the finished length.  Next a tlvm paper, cover ing is pasted  over the top. and the botton^., of each tube  and the bottom paper is crowded into  the hollow centre with the" useful haih  With the bundles right side up the workman next makes small boles in the top  covers, scatters into these the powder  and distributes it fairly, evenly with a  light brush. The powder is tamped down  into the middle of the tube, the fuse inserted and a final tamping administered  with a mallet and a nail. One workman  can make twenty of these bundles up  to the point of adding the powder in.a  dav.	72672756 Bytes	3137	7720	68931008	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510121011.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1776	1776	1777.jp2	/asm0400/image/1777.jp2

"China would force every foreigner out  of her borders In five minutes if she  dared. But, after all, China would only  like to do what the United States is trying to do with the tariff."  This was the sentiment expressed in an  interview yesterday upon the relations between this country and China by Prof. J.  J. M. De Groot, professor of Chinese language and literature of the University of  Leyden, Holland, who is visiting- Philadelphia as the guest of the University of  Pennsylvania.  "China would close her doors to the  Western world today if she could," declared Doctor De Groot. The Chinese Government realizes that the country is larga  enough to support itself, and the attitue  is only natural. Every country in the  world, were it large enough to do so,  would follow the tariff policy of the United  States, and there is very little difference  between the "closed door" and the high  tariff.  "China feels a certain kind of sympathy  for the United States. Both countries are  large, and both are by nature able to exist  for themselves. It is this which has  brought so many Chinese students to the  United   States."  Professor De Grcot will stay in this  country.until Christmas. His next lecture  on China will be delivered at 4 o'clock on  Monday afternoon at the Houston Club.

She is the wife of Dr. Hamilton Wright, an eminent authority on tropical  diseases, and one of the three American Commissioners to the International Opium Conference at Shanghai, the other two being the Rt. Rev. Charles H. Brent, D.D., Episcopal  Bishop of the Philippines, and Dr. C. H. Tenney, Chinese Secretary of the American  Legation at Peking.—The Editors.  ON February 1 the International  Opium Conference met in Shanghai to discuss an old and important  problem. Twelve nations sent their representatives ; namely, China, Great Britain,  the United States, France, Holland,  Portugal, Germany, Japan, Russia, Turkey,  Persia, and Siam—every nation, in fact,  affected directly or indirectly by the opium  trade.  But first and foremost these Powers  convened in the interests of China, in  answer to her protest that this pernicious  trade should longer be forced upon her.  Through the decades China has lifted her  voice against this commerce, which in a  century has spread from one end to the  other of her wide provinces, has paralyzed  her labor, has robbed her treasury, and  has finally become a menace to her very  national existence. She has protested  indignantly, she has pleaded abjectly, she  has been insolent, she has been arrogant,  she has used force, she has tried persuasion. She has been bold as a lion, timid  as a hare. She has run the whole gamut  of her contradictory make-up—and to no  avail. The better mind of the nation has  consistently opposed this evil, but the  hands, the unscrupulous instruments, the  great army of corrupt officialdom, have  ever stood with open palms, willing to sell  their country into hopeless bondage.  When g.reed waits without and treachery  within, the battle is indeed a losing one.  Once mQre China has raised her voice,  and the United States, impressed by the  justice of her cause and the sincerity of  her purpose, has called together those  Powers which are affected by this problem,  with the hope of arriving at some conclusion which will allow her once and for all  to be rid of this demoralizing drug.  Great Britain has expressed her willing  ness to stop her exportation of opium  from India, if China will guarantee that  the poppy shall not be raised in her own  empire. In other words, England will  play the game if China will assure her  that she has no ulterior motive in shutting out a trade upon which for nearly  a century India's prosperity has largely  depended. This seems to be a fair proposition, and it is the business of the Commission to reduce the understanding to  international terms, so that in the future  there will be no doubt as to its being carried out. In righting this wrong of so  many years' standing, it must be remembered that Great Britain is to pay the  piper, is to forfeit an enormous revenue,  upon which the welfare of many of her  colonies are dependent. And the world,  which has not been slow to criticise, should  not be less quick to admire a notion that  will openly admit and mend a fault—at a  prodigious self-sacrifice.  Incidentally, the opium question may  be no longer confined to China and England alone. The investigations of the  various commissions have resulted in depressing discoveries in other countries,  more especially in the United States,  where the opium habit, unperceived, has  blossomed into a flourishing vice. The  opium question, therefore, has in a true  sense become an international one—  which will result in a general scrutiny, and,  it is to be hoped, the crushing out of one  of the most subtle and pernicious menaces  that has ever assailed mankind. We have  in America an amazing record, which  shows in thirty years an increase in the  importation of opium from 77,000 to  151,000 pounds per year. We have complacently attributed this to our Chinese  population, if we have considered it at  all, and have stood with pious mien and	66012860 Bytes	3788	5807	3629892813	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510123011.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1778	1778	1779.jp2	/asm0400/image/1779.jp2

The eye-opening significance of  these statistics lies in the fact that in 1880  we passed a Chinese Exclusion Law, and  in consequence the Chinese population  has been steadily decreasing, in reverse  ratio to the importation of opium.  But in this paper it is necessary to go  back to beginnings, and we must deal with  the Chino-British question, which has been  before the world for nearly a century,  and for the consideration of which the  Conference was specially convened. To  do this fairly means a brief historical  review. This takes us back to 1632,  when the English first attempted to enter  into trading relations with China. This  overture was repulsed, as were two later  ventures. In 1664 we find a vague trading relationship existing between the East  India Company and^ome Chinese merchants in Canton. The English clung  with tenacity to this beginning, grudgingly  granted by the Chinese, who ever threatened to bring it to a close, and stubbornly  balked at any attempt to extend it.  Nevertheless the British hold became  stronger, and in 1770 a recognized trade  was established between the English  supercargoes representing the East India  Company and the Chinese Hongs, or  merchant bodies. The British chafed  under the restrictions imposed by the  Chinese merchants and at the arrogant  attitude they assumed towards the English traders. There were constant collisions between the natives and the floating British population, composed largely  of sailors, smugglers, and adventurers of  dubious record. From the onset of this  trade there was continual friction and  trouble between the two races. Finally  the Company felt that if they could reach  the ear of the Emperor and present their  case to him the trade could go forward on  much more satisfactory lines. But every  attempt that was made to communicate  with higher authorities was thwarted by  the Chinese Hongs. In 1792 the Home  Government decided to send a mission to  the Chinese Court for the purpose of  making a direct appeal. Lord Macartney  was chosen as Ambassador, and proceeded  to China with a large suite. He was  received by the Emperor, and gifts were  exchanged.    But  his   appeal  for  better  trade relations was dealt with very shortly  by the Emperor, who answered bluntly  that he would not consider the question,  and that if the British traders tried to  push their trade into new ports against  his authority, they could expect to be  treated as lawbreakers and malefactors.  Getting no encouragement from Peking,  the trade slipped back into its old unsatisfactory groove. The traders, nevertheless,  gradually strengthened their position in  Canton and spread out imperceptible feelers along the coast. In 1816 the relations  became so strained that the British were  once more tempted to open negotiations  with Peking. This ended disastrously in the  mission of Lord Amherst, who, refusing to  perform the kowtow before the Emperor,  was unceremoniously ordered to leave the  country. The Emperor's letter explaining  this incident to the King of England is a  masterpiece of arrogance and naivete,  He tells the English King quite frankly  that it is a long distance to China. " To  send an Ambassador over the waves of  the sea is not an easy business. Further,  your Ambassador cannot understand and  practice the rites and ceremonies of China.  The subject involves a severe labor of the  lips and tongue, to hear which is by no  means pleasant." But the English monarch  is further given to understand that the  " Celestial Empire does not value things  brought from a distance," and, as if this  were not sufficient, the Emperor adds,  " Also the extraordinary and ingenious productions of your country, it does not look  upon as rare pearls." He ends this delicious  document with the following : " That you,  O King, should preserve your people in  peace, and be attentive to strengthen the  limits of your territory, that no separation  of that which is near should take place, is  what I, the Emperor, in truth highly commend. Hereafter, there is no occasion  for you to send an Ambassador so far,  and to be at the trouble of passing over  mountains and crossing seas."  It was not, however, until 1822 that  the real trouble began. Opium, which  had been but an indifferent trade item,  suddenly blossomed forth amazingly.  China issued edicts against the trade ; but  to no avail. Her officials were not above  being bribed, then as now.

The Chinese regarded  this new departure with intense hostility,  as they felt that the English were pushing  their claims. The repeated protests of  the Emperor fell on empty air. Opium  flooded the country, and was housed in  receiving ships directly under the nose of  the Chinese authorities. Commissioner  Lin came to Canton armed with the big  stick, and his actions were no less strenuous than his words. It was easy reading  to those who ran that Lin would " root up  this enormous evil," or die in the attempt.  Lin succeeded in impressing the foreign  traders with the fact that he meant, business. He demanded that they surrender  the opium in the receiving ships. There  was much parleying and subterfuge and  delay, and finally offers of compromise on  the part of the merchants. Lin stood his  ground, and insisted that all the opium be  given up. The traders hesitating, Lin  prevented all boats from leaving Canton,  and as they still resisted, a blockade of the  entire foreign community was instituted.  In the end the opium was surrendered, to  the amount of over twenty thousand  pounds, and thoroughly destroyed under  the supervision of Lin himself. Lin next  demanded that the traders should sign  bonds against further trading in opium, on  penalty of death. The British superintendent refused to have anything to do  with such a bond. A few of the merchants continued to smuggle opium defiantly. Lin insisted upon their banishment. The tension between the English  official and the Chinese high commissioner  grew more strained. Riots broke out  among the natives and the English sailors.  A native was killed.  Thus came about the Opium War—  the most unjustifiable conflict that was  ever waged. The British were of course  successful.  The English traders were much encouraged by this victory, and a little later  they attempted to get the opium trade  legalized. But this the Chinese Emperor  hotly refused to do. He admitted that he  could not prevent the introduction of the  " flowing poison," and continued in a bitter  strain:  " Gain-seeking and corrupt  men  will for profit and sensuality defeat my  wishes, but nothing will induce me to  derive a revenue from the vice and misery  of my people." The years directly following record nothing but strife and friction. The Chinese grew to fear as well  as to hate the foreigner. The trade  increased with leaps and bounds, despite  the oft-repeated complaints of the Chinese  merchants that their own legitimate trade  was being ruined by the illicit and detestable traffic of opium. The smugglers  grew more defiant as they saw the Chinese  incapacity to uphold their laws. There  followed inevitably another war, which  owed its direct cause to the affair of  the Arrow, a Chinese boat built and  manned by Chinese, but flying the British  flag. This vessel was boarded by some  Chinese officials who claimed they had  seen among the cre^ a noted Chinese  criminal wanted by China. The flag was  hauled down and the crew arrested. The  most important result of this war was the  legalization of opium, against which China  had fought for more than a century.  But a new page has been turned in the  history of the Far East. The events of the  past decade have been as a pebble dropped  into the placid waters of a pool, and the  ripples have stirred and spread to the  uttermost reaches of the East. They  have started once more a pulse-beat in  the sluggish blood of this half-stupefied  nation, have roused in them a final rebellion against the slow poison which is sucking their strength and their manhood from  them. We in America have taken up  their cudgels, and believe in their sincerity,  believe that it is their serious wish to eliminate an evil which has reduced them to  one of the least competent of nations. In  coping with this stupendous problem, the  stamping out of a habit the most compelling and pernicious that has ever  fastened upon man, China shows a  strength, a vitality, that speaks prodigious  possibilities for the future. Since our own  slavery question there has been nothing  more vital, more appealing, before the  nations. If the twelve Powers at the  Shanghai Convention can bring a satisfactory solution to this century-old scandal, they will indeed have hastened the  forward march of progress and civilization.

TOD SLOAN'S RISE AND FALL  ■  FAME AND FORTUNE QUICKLY  WON   AND   QUICKLY   LOST.  His Start Due to Pittsburg Phil's Coach-  feg;—Introduced a New Idea In Rldlr&  —Causes of His Swift Decline—  Another   Jockey's   Transformation.  Tsranty years ago a small boy with a  huge cigar in his mouth sat on an upturned stable bucket and played poker  with his fellows under the shed of a  stable at Sheepshead Bay. A famous  trainer who was passing paused for a  moment to watch the progress of the  game. As he lingered the diminutive  stable boy scanned liis cards, shifted the  big cigar with that deft motion of the  tongue known to old smokers and pushing all the chips in front of him into th©  centre of the board which served as a  table remarked:  "I tap yer."  That boy wasTod Sloan and th© trainer  w&lt;as John Huggms, and both were destined to make racing history across the  water. The former was to introduce the  crouch seat in England and the latter  was to be th© forerunner of a long line  of successful American trainers who  were to make names for themselves as  horsemen in England, France, Germany  and Russi^.  Sloan^ rifee to fame and fortune was  almost aft tl^id as his decline. For some  years coSsl^red a third rate jockey, his  star began to shine after he became a  protege of the late George E. Smith,  better known as Pittsburg Phil. The  possessor of a marvellously light pair of  hands, he had the first great requisite for  a successful race rider, and when he fell  into the hands of Smith, the closest observer that the American turf has ever  known, he learned many things about  horses which he had never noticed before  or probably had not considered an essential to success in his profession.  It Was in California that Smith took  Sloan ifinder his wing, and those who were  on the coast at that time tell of seeing  the plunger straddle a chair and go  through the motions of riding a horse,  talking earnestly the while tfb Sloan, who  paicrlthe strictest attention to every word  and movement of his mentor. Those in  the East who had seen Sloan ride when he  was in the employ of tValeott and Campbell and who thought him an indifferent  horseman were amazed when they saw  the change at Morris Park the following  spring, when Pittsburg Phil's horses and  others ridden by Sloan won race after  race. They could not understand th©  change.  The horses that the young man from  Kokomo rode did not seem to be the same  thoroughbreds that they had known  when handled by other boys. Sour  tempered, sluggish brutes became tractable front runners with an apparent  desire to show their best form. The  lange was due to the wizardry of Sloan,  hew found alchemy the secret of which  apparently alone possessed, and following in his wake came Pittsburg Phil  silent, inscrutable, reaping a golden  'arvest.  no those who could aid him Smith was  prodigal, and soon Sloan was on the  dng wave of prosperity.   His rai-  *f the costliest and his cigars  1'd blacker than those of  ch the possible excep-  The same is true of the jockey's seat in  the saddle. If the weight is upon the  withers th© horse in galloping is relieved  of much of the burden and the elose  clinging posture with th© swaying of the  body tends to a smoothness of motion  unobtainable with the upright or semi-  upright seat of many old time riders in  this country and of all or nearly all oi  the English jockeys after whom American  riders copied for upward of a century.  Having this knowledge, Sloan added  a pair of deft hands, with which he tickled  the mouth of the most stubborn horses.  These animals, most of them ruined by  heavy handed, vicious boys who scratched  and tore the sensitive nerves of the mouth  and tongue until the horses with all their  courage fought back in very resentment,  did not understand th© sort of treatment  he gave them at first, but a reassuring  caress on the neck, a playful pull of the  ear and jockey and horse were in perfect  harmony. Is it any wonder the sour  tempered ones were willing to run for  him?  They were petted into subjection, and  they, like their human prototypes, ended  by giving something for kindness which  no amount of brutality could compel.  The cases of Damien, Our Johnny, Kriss  Kringle, Ornament and others in America  and of Knight of the Thistle in Bingland  were only a few that come §o mind now,  but there were many other Worses of evil  repute that fell under his spell.  Fortune came fast abroad and when  the jockey returned to NeWjYork to ride  Ballyhoo Bey in the Futur tf f or the late  William 0, Whitnej he tolqlan acquaintance in this country that me had more  than $300,000 to his credit tin England.  Quite a sum for the tattere* stable boy  who a few years before sm&ed his big  cigar as he sat upon a waterlbucket and  played poker at Sheepshead pay!  A King of England had complimented  him upon his horsemanship land he had  been lionized by the biggest) men of the  English turf. It would be (amazing if  he had not been spoiled by ail the adulation which came his way. TAe day when  he committed the unfortunate mistake  of bidding on a yearling wfien a representative of the King was in the ring,  pushing his way through the press of  nobility, cigar in mouth, was the beginning of his undoing. Then came the  striking of the waiter with a champagne  bottle at Ascot and the revocation of his  license as a rider.  They give no reasons for their rulings  as a general thing in England. It is for  the good of the turf, and that suffices.  Nobody questions the rulihg, and those  ruled against pass. They rarely come  back.  Bereft of a profession Sloan turned  player; his cunning was gone when wagering upon somebody else's skill in the saddle  and his friends and his money vanished  together. *V  Speaking recently to an official who had  tried to advise Sloan and who had always  made him behave himself when he rode  in this country the jockey with tears in  his eyes said:  "I wish to God that everybody had  treated me as you did. I wouldn't be  broken in pocket and I would b© a better  man in every way. You made me come  to time th© same as the humblest stable  boy and you were more my friend a  thousand times over than those who  let me make a fool of myself."  Sloan's career should be a lesson to  every boy following the profession of  riding to-day. Every youngster when  starting out in the ranks no doubt has the  best intentions. He ha£ read or heard  of th© dozens of riders who failed to put!  by a competency against th» day when  they should become too heavy or too old  to ride or perhaps be disabled. They  achieve some success; the flatterer comes,  and the money coming easily goes twice as !  easily, with never a thoughtsof the mor- !  row. Of coursevthere are cases of thrift  here and there, fyut nine out often have  never a thought of the morrow. They  live in the golden present.  Some of the transitions from the pinch  of want to the lap of luxury are amusing.  There was once a ragged urchin of the  East Side of New York who played in the  atr-p^ts cTh^Wct in summer time and the  FAMOUS TRIP OF A TINY BARK  CAPT. FITCH SAILED ON THE  RED,   WHITE   AND   BLUE.  On© of Two Men Who Navigated a 16  Foot Boat From New York to London in 1866—Now in the Sailors' Snug  Harbor—Log of 3,000 Mile Voyage.  A correspondent recently wrote to  The Sun asking if anything was known  of the present whereabouts of the two men  who in the 16 foot bark Red, White and  Blue crossed the Atlantic in 1866, from  New York to Gravesend, in 40 days and  16 hours. One of the two men, Capt.  Frank E. Fitch, is now an inmate of  Sailors' Snug Harbor. The captain has  com© to anchor there after spending  twenty-one years in the Orient, during  the latter part of which time he was  connected with the floating equipment  of the quartermaster's department, TJ.  S. A., in the Philippines. He was for a  time port officer at Manila.  Capt. Fitch's most prized possessions  are the log of the Red, White and Blue,  copies of the Illustrated London News  picturing the little ship on exhibition  in the-Crystal Palace, London, copies  of Hunt's Yachting Magazine, an English  publication which took up the fight on  behalf of the little craft's navigators  against a storm of protests that the  voyage had never been made and extracts from scores of American, British  and European papers relating to the trip.  For that a full rigged bark only 26 feet  over all had made the trip was doubted  and denied until ample corroboration  slowly came from a dozen ships arriving  at American and European ports whose  logs reported sighting the little craft.  Before telling something of the voyage,  whose successful termination, by the way,  was related in one of the first news despatches sent by Atlantic cable, some  description of the Nlittle boat obtained  from Capt. Fitch will be of interest. She  was built by O. R. Ingersoll, builder  of a then new type of life saving boat,  at 159 South street in this city. Her  dimensions were: Length, 26 feet; beam,  6 feet 1 inch; depth of hold, 2 feet 8 inches;  from deck to keel, 3 feet. She had sharp  stem and stern, four foot watertight  compartments in each end, the hull was  all of metal, and for the vdyage she was  completely decked over with the exception of a small cockpit aft.  Here are some dimensions which more  vividly present the picture of her tininess:  Her bowsprit was 2 feet long, jibboom  3 feet, flying jibboom 2 feet. Her foremast  from deck to top was 6 feet, topmast 7  feet 6 inches. Her other masts and spars \  were in such nice proportion that a picture of her, unless the figure of a man is  included to suggest her size by contrast,  makes her look like any ablebodied ship  that might come into the harbor to-day.  Her tonnage, duly entered at the Custom House, was noted as two and one-  half tons. She was further described as  having accommodations for two men or  one woman. At the time she was making  her way from the Hudson to the Thames  the Great Eastern was making the voyage in the opposite direction laying the  Atlantic cable, and what a midget the  Red, White and Blue really was is further  realized if one recalls that the other ship  was registered as of 22,500 tonnage, 680  feet in length, 83 feet in breadth, 60 feet  deep and had accommodations for 400  saloon passr- rers.

The navigators knew that they were seen,  for when the ensign of the Red, White  and Blue was set that of the bark was  also,,, but the nationality of the latter  could not be made out, as its ensign hung  down like a dish rag in the calm. Whoever was the skipper of the unknown  bark, the adventurers considered him an  ill natured sailor chap, for when a light  wind sprang up and the Red, White and  Blue headed to speak to the bark the  latter wore around to the north, "evidently  not wishing to speak to us," as the log  recounts. * ■■  Following the calm came favoring  winds, and the little ship's log records  successively daily runs of 92, 124, 1-04  and 115 miles. On July 20 the wind drew  ahead and only twenty-six miles were  made. On July 22 they ran out of the  Gulf Stream and thereafter the^ record  of discomfort is scarcely relieved by any  day's history as recounted in the log.  We read of "shipping water," "no cooking  to-day," &c. The temperature dropped  and besides being wet through nearlyj  all the time they were dismally chilled. ;  On July 30 a large whale, excited by  curiosity no doubt, came alongside, and  finally so insistent and intimate were  his attentions that they veered and kept  away from him.

On August 18 abreast of Margate it  came on to blow so hard that the skipper  of the Red, White and Blue accepted a  tow into harbor, and for the first time in  thirty-four days the captain and mate  stretched their legs in dry beds. Their  time from port to port was 38 days. On  August 18 they sailed out of Margate  and with a light wind beat up for the  mouth of the Thames. They made fast  at a wharf at Greenhithe on the fortieth  day, and from there the little boat was  trucked to London, where she became  a popular exhibit at the Crystal Palace.

Ex-Owner of the New York National  League Team—Prizefighter Who Is  Eager to Forget—Player Who Has  Turned Lawyer—A Famous Amateur.  "These battles between the Giants and  the Cubs always attract the notables,"  said the man who knows everybody as  he looked over the crowd in the big grand  stand at a recent New York-Chicago  game. "Sitting in the back row is a man  with a grizzled gray mustache, smoking  one cigar after another. He's all alone,  you see, and he looks as if he'd experienced much trouble in his time. Long  ago he put up a few hundred dollars to establish the first New York Baseball Club.  "The game was hardly known to the  masses then, but as soon as this man  spent his money for a ball park away  over on the East Side baseball began to  pay. Then he leased the old Polo Grounds  at 110th street and Fifth avenue, where  he made a tremendous success. I remember a game played by the Detroits and  the Giants there in 1887 when the crowd  broke down the turnstiles and fences.  Nobody could say just how many persons  saw that game, but the crowd was so  large that the players only had the diamond to themselves. The profits of the •  New York club were so great that year  that somebody or other' became jealous,  for not long after the Board of Aldermen  ordered the cutting of 111th street through  the grounds and the club had to move.  This man was game, however, and while  a new Polo Grounds was in the course  of construction at'155th street and Eighth  avenue he took the Giants to St. George,  Staten Island, to play half a season at  a big loss.  "When the season of 1889 was finished  at the new Polo Grounds our old friend  soon learned that all but three of the  champion Giants had deserted him for  the Brotherhood. Then began a ruinous  baseball war, which gradually forced New  York's pioneer magnate to the wall and  compelled him to retire to private business.    But he is stUl a fan.  "The square shouldered, stocky chap  with a light mustache and blue gray eyes  who is sitting not far away was one of  the old fellow's star players more than  twenty years ago. He bobbed to the  surface up in Rhode Island as a pitcher  first and soon commanded a good salary.  Unlike some of the Bugs and Rubes vou  read about he saved his money and studied  rights until he was able to attend law  school at Columbia. He played ball  every year with great success, being a  superb base runner, and one of the first  to make use of the bunt. In time as a  New York player he drew a $5,000 salary,  but kept on studying. The heigl t of his  ambition was reached when he managed  a winner. Then without fuss or feathers  he announced that he was through with  ball playing forever, and he kept his word.  "The sixfooter with tanned face and  pompadour hair is a royal rooter.

A Pilgrimage Out of Pekin Along the  Grand Canal—Queer Stone Figures  Guarding Grave of Princess Put to  Death  Wrongly—Chinese   Boatmen.  Pekin, July 18. — When a certain  Chinese Emperor, having ordered a concubine to be put to death for some supposed crime, discovered after her death  that she was innocent he was graciously  pleased to order that a P'ai fang (memorial arch) should be erected to her memory  and that a tablet inscribed with the words  "Erected by command of the Emperor"  should be placed on it. The tomb thus  built is within a few miles of Pekin,  and partly out of curiosity to see the  imperial gift and partly out of a desire  to travel on the Grand Canal, which runs  close by it, T made the trip there the  other morning with Fung, my Chinese  boy.  Though we started at G the sun was  already giving warning of what it intended  to make us suffer later, and I realized  that however impracticable according  to Western taste the average Chinaman's  idea of summer costume is the only one  for comfort, namely a fan and a pleasant  smile. As we made our way along the  top of the city wall we disturbed the  slumbers of many inmates of the hovels  which  abound   there,   for   finding  thei  I  cramped quarters hot and stifling they  had thrown themselves down to sleep  OH Teed mats beneath the srars.

He told us in emphatic words that this  boat could not go; it was not his, it was  not its turn and, moreover, it had no sailors. At the end of the line we noticed a  couple of youths lazily unfastening a  barge. This other barge, the old fellow  told us, was the one we must take, a,s it  had sailors—himself and the two youngsters. As there seemed to be no alternative we submitted to his dictation, but  it was with many qualms we got on board,  for every plank was riddled with holes,  pitted as if with smallpox, and many were  broken away in places from age.  We were no sooner seated in the well  than the captain said we could not start  until we had discussed the price. I  knew from experience that once we began  to discuss -the price it would be an hour  before any satisfactory arrangement was  concluded, so I decided to break away  from the usual custom. He mentioned the  sum of $3 (Mexican) to the first lock, which  we could see from the top of the walls  and therefore knew was not far. I askeel  how many miles it was. He did not  know. How long did it take? In spite  of the fact that he makes the trip many  times each day he could not say. So I  told him to go ahead and I would pay him  the right price at the end of the journey.  This did not meet with his ideas of propriety, especially jn dealing with a foreign  devil, so he reduced the price to $2.50.  Eventually after wasting fifteen minutes  and finding that I continued obdurate  and refused to discuss the price he pushed  off to the opposite bank muttering something which I was sure was far from complimentary to the barbarian in his boat. |  At the bank one of the sailors got ashore  with the towline ^nti we drifted out into  midstream. Then as the line tightened  we glided forwsird! in response to the  even stride of the frfound muscled young  Hercules, whose |oi outfit was a pair of  blue linen trouscistad a palmleaf fan.  As we passed| between, the banks of  maize and tall ^oart reeds, where brown  skinned infants! minted and captured  the handsome dAgo| fly, the only sounds  that broke the ftlliJns were the splashing and chatte.-Kig fyt a thousand ducks  and the tedioiisibhanting of some storyteller on a distamt l|arge. Presently the  towers on the pith ipet, one ducked and  the other swung his rope up and passed  it over him. Tit voice died away. Then  another barge c)pmiig westward toward  the city and crlwdeti like the first with  cool clad Celestifls and towed by a couple  of  lithe limbed  frain.  At the lock  dragons    with  bhildreii took up the re-  given him abou  pay.    Later  I  gparded by two sprawling  dowhbent heads and  mouths that lapjthe water, we got ashore  and I handed the captain 40 cents. The  jo surprised to get it that  he took it without a word of complaint  and I came to tfoe conclusion that I had  twice what the Chinese  'ound that I had given  him four times as much—for the Chinese  pay but five cents for the trip.  A crowd of toungsters ranging from  2 to 14 ye'ars, brown: as mahogany and  unconscious of their nakedness as Adam,  clamored for money, and many of them  with the instinct of their race already  well developed offered to perform small  tricks, but wdre careful to bargain with  me beforehand as to the number of  coppers I should pay. j It seems as if the  Chinese babe were born with a gift for  business, for every mite of 2 and 3 years  is a master of the art of bargaining.  A short distance from the lock we found  a patriarch clad in a pair of ragged  trousers standing upon an insecure  looking bridge of mud bricks and straw  that spanned a tributary of the canal.  His ribs showed through the withered  skin, his remaining wisps of gray hair  were carefully plaited and his little  goatee beard and mustache were white  as snow. He leaned feebly upon a knotty  stick, and though his hearing was gone  his eyes were still keen enough to detect  a foreigner.  No sooner did we come into his line of  vision than he began wailing and kowtowing in a way that betokened more  strength than I at first imagined he possessed. Fung told me that he was the  proud builder of this ancient structure,  which I could well believe without much  stretch of imagination*,; Consequently  out of deference to his years and former  skill I paid him toll, though it would  have been as easy, and probably safer,  to step across the trickle of water that  ran beneath.  Soon after crossing this bridge our  path lay through a field of reeds and I  grasses growing from ten to twenty feet j  high, and on emerging we saw we were I  at the foot of the broad store stairway j  leading to the tomb of the princess.  On the right, seated close to the canal,  With their mutilated stumps of feet stuck |  out in a a ungainly fashion, were two I  Chinese women beating clothes. Near by !  some men and youths, having Washed j  their one garment and laid it in the sun i  to dry, paddled about in mid stream, \  while several naked children gambolled, j  on the bank. A round tin par: stood i \ j  our path. In this a pair of chubby, cur.- .  burnt   twins with fringes resembling a j  Chinese doll's hair and wearing as immutable an expression patiently waited  until their mother was ready to wash  them.  As we mounted the stairway one of  the boys came forward to act as guide.  He told us he would run ahead to get his  father with the* key, without which We  could not see the tomb. Off he scampered  like a hare. But in a .moment we dis-  i covered that he had had a little business  of his own in view.  Before wo hai reached the top of the  stairway he had returned, and resting  one small brown foot on the step of the  P'ai fa eg he waved aloft something ii  triumph. When we ce.me up we discovere 1  he had a lotus fewer. The stem was stuck  through the centre of its huge green leaf  and as he opened it it almost screened the  little brown body silhouetted against the  white marble f*voh. For this flower, as  was expected of us, we duly bargained,  and after much discussion the price was  reduced from $0 .cents to one cent (Mexican).  Beyond the p'ai fang we saw two courtyards overgnmni with trees'and a wilderness of weo ° :k id shrubs, A locked door  guarded by I couple of imperial lions  grinning fror! ear to ear was ope ".el by  the drowsy raatclimaau In tho costre of  the yard, msfcatei on a high platform  but almost hmdeo. by overhangi .g trees,  stood a huge Jsireuln~ monument of brick,  beneath whidp repose the remains of the  princess.

Several broken,  overturnei ptone cvidlesticks littere:!  the ground.  In the outer yard, forming an avenue  to three tumble down houses, the solid  f  stone guardians of the lady's honor defy  the hand of time; a Manchu and a Oh!ii*;ji  mandarin each in his official robes,  Mongolian ponies with handsome trappings, curious shaped cows with down  curled horns, tigers with amiable grins"'  and sheep whose ample proportions would  rouse feelings of envy in the bosom of the  j most successful sheep raiser.  At the end of this avenue of stone, in  j one of the ruined houses, wac a monster  j turtle bearing  on  its  back a tablet in-  ! scribed with the words "Erected by command  of  the   Emperor."    The   lettering  on the tablet is now faint; the house in  which   it  stands  is  dilapidated and   the  double  superposed   roof,   bare   of   the  glazed tiles that once adorned it, is now  thatched with weeds and grasses.  The  whole   place   seemed   so    fcr'orn  and   desolate,   as   if   inhabited   only   by  j silent, creeping things,  that in spite of  &lt; the shade it afTordeo.

China and its progress under the stimulus of the work of missionaries had a  large place in the deliberations of the  World's Christian Citizenship Conference  yesterday.  Some missionary women some years  ago gave to the Dowager Empress of  China a Bible and, according to Isaac  T. Headland, a prominent Methodist of  Pekin, therein lay the beginning of the  wonderful strides China has made in the  years of the immediate past.  This Dowager Empress was a wonderful woman, as pictured by Mr. Headland. The most wonderful Oriental woman of the 19th century. She was a  poor girl, who became one of the Emperor's wives, and once within court circles she exerted an influence that served  to rearrange the whole dynasty.  The youthful Emperor, her son, now  reigning, got hold of the American Bible  and read it, according to Mr. Headland.  And, whereas prior to that inception of  the Christian faith China had made some  slight progress in the way of following  in the footsteps of the advancing world,  from the date that the boy Emperor  caught the spirit of the modern faith,  the strides were tremendous, the. speaker  declared.  Mr. Headland showed how the influence  of modern inventions, together with the  stimulus of Christianity, had affected the  youthful mind, and, he said, edict followed edict, once the spirit of advance was  thoroughly inculcated, abolishing old customs and attacking superstitions of the  Empire.  The speaker talked of court life most  entertainingly. His associations with the  imperial family, and especially with the  Emperor himself, made his discourse  most colorful. He pictured the boy taken  from the life of childhood and closeted  in the palace. The youthful mind, in its  search of diversion from the rigid court  custom for which he cared nothing, turned, he said, to Chinese toys. These were  dull, the inventions of a people without the imagination to appeal to the spirit  of  the child.  Finally some foreign missionaries sent  to him some European toys, modern inventions, typifying the movement and activity of the living world. The boy was  fascinated   and   enthralled.  A railroad was constructed for him  around the Lotos Lake, inclosed within  the palace grounds, continued the speaker. On this read he rode with the members of the court. A launch was imported, and in this he took trips upon  the lake, towing the royal barges laden  frequently   with   royal   freight.  fiie boy, declared Mr. Headland, caught  the spirit of invention and of progress.  And lie read eagerly. He sent over to  ;.he Bible Society's headquarters in Pekin  and asked for books which had been  translated into the Chinese tongue. He  read all he could get and studied the  Bible  assidiously.  The speaker told a most amusing story  of the first bicycle ride the boy Emperor took. One day Mrs. Headland  rode into the palace court and left her  wheel" standing beside the portico, he  said. The youthful ruler saw it and  wanted to know what kind of a cart that  was.  ;; Mr. Headland showed the Emperor how  it was ridden. As he watched the American ride round and round the compound he was anxious to know why "the  cart didn't fall over." Then Mr. Headland said he explained to His Imperial  Highness,   *'because it is going, ahead."  And using this remark as a symbol  of progress. Mr. Headland said that no  movement would collapse while it was  going ahead. And the Christianizing  spirit in China, he said, is doing just  that.  "The Chinese," continued the speaker,  "invented the compass, but thev never  made   a   really  good   compass.

His publication is the voice of the progressive party in China, and it Is from  that party that he brings a message to  America.  " I can do very little in the time that is  left to me before I must leave for  Shanghai," Capt. Kirton said last night,  " but I want the people here to know  the work we are doing. I want the  publicists of America to be familiar with  the National Review and its purposes.  This is my message to America that  China is now receptive, and is growing  more and more eager for the investment  there of foreign capital, foreign enterprise and foreign skill. My message is  one of extreme amity toward America.  "The doctrine of the progressive party  and of the National Review, which is its  voice, is that the social and political development of China must be accompanied,  if not preceded by, economic development. And for her economic development China needs the help of the outside  world, a truth which we have been hammering, into the heads of her people, so  that now the old resentment and hostility  toward foreign influence of any kind has  become a negligible feature.  " With China once in the field of wide  French, English, and American investment, she can demand recognition as an  international power, and thus preserve  her national integrity. Had such investment been made some years ago, the encroachments of Russia and Japan would  have'been impossible, and that is why,  to-day, the Russians and Japanese are  doing all in their power to thwart the  purposes of the progressive party, and in  their virtual alliance they are striving to  subvert  China's  development."  Capt. Kirton spoke with the eagerness  of one devoted heart and soul to a cause,  when he discussed last night the purpose  o fhis visit. Te was talking in his rooms  at the Hotel Woodstock. Before he leaves  for China by way of San Francisco he  will review the situation with President  Taft, whom he met in the Far East.  The National Review is only three years  old, and Capt. Kirton's co-proprietor is  his Excellency Taotai Yuen-chain, better  known as Y. C. Tong, a Columbia University graduate of the seventies. It was  founded to give the English-speaking  world a correct understanding of the  Chinese opinion on fnternational questions.  It is supplied by order of the Government to all provincial headquarters, to  all Ministries and Consulates, to every  educational establishment in China. The  State Department in Washington takes  two copies. Its important articles are  translated by order of the Government for  the instruction of Government officials,  including the Prince Regent. With this  as its clientele, the paper, a 5-cent weekly  of 5,000 circulation, is able to advertise  in such terms as these:  Advertise in every paper in the United  States and you reach indirectly 05,000,000  people.     Advertise in The National Review  and you reach directly the responsible leaders of 400,000,000 people.  The paper's motto is " China for the  Chinese."  "One thing for which we have worked,  and which I can announce now as a thing  accomplished, is the establishment of  English as the secondary official language of the empire," said Capt. Kirton.  Then reverting to the matter of investment and the economic development of  China   he said:  " It is such a fertile filed, such a matchless market! Think of it! There are 400,-  000,000 people living in 4,000,000 square I  miles of land, an average of 100 persons  to the square mile, and that average is  made up of vast untouched areas, comparable to young Wyoming. Those people are supported almost entirely by agriculture  " Think what it means as a commentary on the thrift and the industry of  the Chinese. Think what it means as a  .field for economic adventure. Foreign  skill and foreign capital would reap its j  profit, and to China would go the benefit  of the completed undertakings as well as  the benefit that accrues to any people  from the presence of a developing enterprise."  Capt. Kirton is an Englishman and saw  service in the British Army in the South  African and other campaigns. As war  correspondent he accompanied the first  army of Japan, under Gen. Kuroki, during the Russo-Japanese war. The possibilities of China appealed to his fighting  spirit, his spirit of adventure, and to his  optimism. He threw in his lot with the  party of progress and reform, and has  given up everything else. He left Shanghai on Feb. 1 and has been in England up  to two weeks ago. At Salt Lake City, in  1906, he married an American woman.  Mrs. Kirton is with him on his journey.  Capt. Kirton spoke with the greatest regard for his associate. Y. C. Ton^, a man  of wide Influence in Chinese affairs. Just  now he Is the host of a grpup of American  business men visiting the Orient, having  personally conducted them from Yokohama to Shanghai.

PEKIN,   June   6.—On   Wednesday   next j  a formal demand  will be made upon  the  Throne for the immediate convocation of |  a national parliament by the delegates to \  the  provincial  assemblies,  who  have  the  support of organizations of merchants.  The recently issued imperial decree constituting the provincial assemblies set  forth that the way was being paved for a'  general legislative body to be summoned  nine years after the first meeting of the  assemblies.  Today delegates to the provincial assemblies are gathered here and have determined not to leave the capital until their  memorial is granted. Eight of their number are pledged to suicide in the event  that Prince Chun, the regent, decides to  adhere -to   his   original   programme.  The merchants are furthering- the aims  of  the  delegates  by  refusing to  pay  the  j stamp tax until the regent comes to their  i way of thinking.   The presentation of the  I memorial   is   not   likely   to   call   forth   an  ! early response.   On the contrary, it is ex-  | pected   that   Prince   Chun   will   delay   his  j reply as  long as possible.  j    It   is   learned   from   the   leaders   of - the  j movement that they do not intend to use  j drastic measures because of the fear that  an   anti-dynastic    revolution    would    only  ! serve to bring the armies of foreign Powers   into   China.

ANNOUNCEMENT    IN   SENATE  Statement    by   Prince   Yu   Lang    Received with Enthusiasm—Original  Plan was for Parliament in 1915.  PEKING, Oct. 31.—It is believed that  the throne has decided to accede to the  demand of the provincial delegates in the  Senate for the early convocation of a popular Parliament.  In the Senate to-day and in the presence  of the leading' Grand Councilors, Prince  Yu Lang, a member.of the Grand Council,  stated that the entire nation, from the  highest to the lowest, was agreed upon  the necessity of the early establishment  of a general Parliament.  The Senators, who understood this to  mean that their memorial would be granted, received the declaration of the Prince  with loud and prolonged cheering.  The importance of this concession on the  part of the Government can scarcely be  overestimated in view of its recent refusal  to entertain a similar request made by a  delegation from the provincial Assemblies  last June.  j The programme fixed by the late Em-  I press Dowager provided for the constitution of a general representative legis-  j lative body to be known as the Imperial  j Parliament in 1915,-at the end of a nine-  ! year period of preparation. No sooner  I had this plan heen made known in a de-  j cree than a popular agitation was begun  j to influence the throne to advance the  ■ date when China might have a truly representative government.  The provincial Assemblies met and discussed the matter,  and received the support   of   the   merchants   throughout   the  . country.    They  sent  a  delegation  to Pe-  | king to memorialize  the  throne,   out   the  !, Prince  Regent  promptly  announced  that  I the original programme would be adhered  ito.   On Oct. 3 the new Senate met for the  J first  time.     Of its 200 members  100 had  'been appointed by the throne,  and there  was every indication "that it would accomplish but little  except as it reflected the  wishes ot the Central Government. Nevertheless,    the   Senate   soon   developed   an  Opposition Party composed of the provincial  delegates,   and   tills  party  has   since  conducted an active campaign looking to  the recognition of the Senate by the Grand  Council as  a body  with  executive  power  rather   than   as   a   body   of   an   advisory  character.  In the meantime the Viceroys and Governors of provinces supported the Opposition by memorializing the throne regarding an early opening of the proposed Parliament. On Oct. 20 such progress had  been made that the Senate adopted, by an  almost unanimous vote, a memorial to  the throne praying for the establishment  of a popular Parliament at the earliest  possible moment.  Two days later the throne ordered t&gt;e  Grand Council to consider the memorial  and to-day's announcement by Prince Yu  Lang is accepted as the decision of the  Grand Councilors that the popular demand should be granted.	29441800 Bytes	1576	6223	527126212	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510129011.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1787	1787	1788.jp2	/asm0400/image/1788.jp2

The immediate occasion of the rioting  at Changsha, in the province of Hunan, appears to be the failure o£ the  rice crop. With all their centuries of  agrarian experience, the Chinese have  not yet learned to distribute the surplus product of one district to relieve  the distress of another. It may be that  in one province the cattle are driven  into the fields to feed and the crops are  used as fuel, while in an adjoining  province the people are starving. The  market for the rice crop is strictly  a local one. While it is permissible to  import grain from abroad in any quantity desired, grain of any kind may not  be transported from one district to another without the express permission of  the Government.  The province of Hunan, through  which passes the direct highroad from  Pekin to Canton, is a storm centre of  anti-foreign sentiment. Near Changsha,  the scene of the present outbreak, is the  '-million-peopled city" of Hankow, the  commercial centre of the Chinese Empire. It is on the great Yang tse Kiang  River, and on the further bank is the  city of Wu-chang, with the Boone  School and St. John's College, well  known to Americans.  la the Yang- tse Valley it is easy for	17429280 Bytes	1752	3312	100673711	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510130011.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1788	1788	1789.jp2	/asm0400/image/1789.jp2

They cannot  bring themselves to believe that any one  would come thousands of miles to import a new religion and to do them  good. They think the Europeans and  Americans must have come among  them for some sinister purpose. The  missionary is supposed to be a political  agent, who deliberately plans to get  himself killed by the natives in order  that his death may provide the Powers  With a good excuse to seize and divide  a province among them. Even the  beneficent administrator of famine relief is supposed to be kidnapping men,  women and children, with the design of  selling them into slavery. To a child,  the foreign devil is the most frightful  of bogeys. Confucius long ago warned  his followers to have nothing to do with  magic, and to the farming population  of an inland province these strange,  white folk from afar are practitioners  of witchcraft.  The Chinese have a saying which  means that the missionary is the advance agent of the gunboat. The gunboats are much in evidence in the present juncture at Changsha. It is to be  hoped that beyond the measures necessary for the protection of the lives and  property of foreigners the allied foreign  Powers will do nothing to conflict with  the efforts of the Chinese authorities  themselves toward the abatement of the  disturbance.  In the last few decades there have  arisen high-minded and patriotic provincial Governors, mindful of the best  interests of their own people. They  understand a tangled and difficult situation better than any outsider, and,  so far as this is possible, the solution  of the problem should be left to them  and not complicated still further by  foreign and, probably, hostile intervention.	24443428 Bytes	1568	5192	751089191	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510130021.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1789	1789	1790.jp2	/asm0400/image/1790.jp2

It appeared in 1678, was translated into several languages, and in its English form has  long been a storehouse of exciting incident  whence fiction writers have drawn. In its  present shape it is furnished with terrific  woodcut portraits of these famous heroes—  or pirates, whichever you like to call them—  and pictures of some of their exploits against  the Spaniards, which for sheer physical intrepidity have never been outdone. Here, for  instance, is the account given by the writer  of the Introduction of a typical method of  starting business :  A party, varying- in number from twenty to fifty  men, would meet to discuss ways and means to sign  agreements, and to choose officers; this done, they  would put to sea in canoes or small vessels, and cruise  on the usual trade routes. If fortunate enough to discover a Spanish vessel, the pirates were not likelv to  be deterred from the attack by any disparity in force,  however great, apparently trusting by superior seamanship and discipline to place themselves at least  on an equality with the enemy. Their first approach  was generally made with great judgment, their tiny  craft being so steered as to avoid the direct fire of  the heavy artillery, while their picked marksmen attempted to strike down the helmsman first, and next  the men attending to the sails. This effected, they  would get under the stern, or other part of the ship  where the guns could not be sufficiently depressed to  reach them, the crew of one of the boats would proceed to wedge up the rudder, while the others would  keep up a fire of musketry directed at the portholes  and bulwarks, so accurately aimed as to prevent any  of the Spanish crew from showing themselves. When  the guns had thus been silenced and the crew forced  to seek shelter, the assailants would board from several quarters at once; the deck once reached, their  personal dexterity in the use of their weapons and  their activity and courage were so marked that they  rarely failed to overpower their opponents.  For a combination of greed, courage, anti-  Romanism (the English buccaneers held  divine service every Sunday)x and the kind  of patriotism which was chiefly hatred of  Spain, these buccaneers were truly marvelous. Old Esquemeling's narrative is fascinating, even if one fancies that there might  be a word or two said on the other side.  (E. P.

Her volume gives a history of the  treatment of the Chinese ; her conclusion is  that the evils of Chinese immigration have  been greatly exaggerated, and that the Chinese should be allowed to become naturalized citizens of the United States, in which  case they would become valuable citizens.  This is not the opinion of all the writers  who have contributed to make the second volume referred to above, a pamphlet  of two hundred pages, which consists of  papers contributed to the American Academy of Political and Social Science both in  favor of and against Oriental exclusion, and  of other papers on National and international aspects of the exclusion movement,  and on the problem of Oriental immigration  outside of America.

Elliott, is a journal of the experiences of a  royalist in Paris during that awful episode.  Her judgment of the active participants in  this tragic drama are valueless. They are  not judgments, they are prejudices. Her  feminine morality was neither better nor  worse than that of court society in that  epoch. But, accepting the truthfulness of  her narration of events, which is in general  confirmed by the historical records of that  time, she was a woman of great courage and  great resource. She voluntarily went into  the trap and braved the "terror" to rescue  a friend who had neither courage nor resource. The story of her concealment of  this not too brave gentleman behind her bed  is as exciting as an incident in Dumas, and  would have served the novelist well. Twice  arrested, she escaped the guillotine rather  by good luck than by good management.  Danger seems to have had no terrors for  her; perhaps to that fact she partly owed  her escape. Her journal is an addition  to the history of the French Revolution  because it gives so dramatically the personal  experience of one who suffered from it and  barely escaped death from its grim tribunal.

In a memorial to the throne at  Pekin in favor of abolishing the queue,  the text of which has just reached Washington, Mr. Wu says Chinese residents in  North, Central and South America have  been mocked and teased by foreigners until they implored him to seek an imperial  edict giving official sanction to cropping  the hair and changing their costume to  accord with Western ideas.  All through Mexico, Peru and Cuba,  where he visited as Minister, he found the  Chinese sincerely loyal and patriotic, but  eight or nine-tenths of them had divested  themselves of their queues or had secreted  them by coiling them on the tops of their  heads. They told him they had found the  hanging down of the queues was inconvenient, soiled their clothes and endangered them in many factories and mills. The  Minister admonished them for changing  their costume, which he regarded as a  sacred part of the Government institution,  but agreed as to the "bald facts" concerning the queues, the elimination of which  he prays for. _	10546680 Bytes	1533	2288	2381211870	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510132011.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1792	1792	1793.jp2	/asm0400/image/1793.jp2

PEKIN, China, Nov. 29.—The projected  loan of $50,000,000, to China by an American financial syndicate may not be finally  concluded, because of the unwillingness  of Chinese to accept a foreign financial  advisor. Without such control it is said  that the promoters are unwilling to proceed.  The present is recognized as a crucial  period in the history of China. If borrowed millions are squandered any calamity will be possible, even a revolution and  the partition of the empire.  The Chinese have never been more sensitive to foreign usurpation of authority  than they are now, and they look upon  the proposition to give the foreign financial group control of the currency reform  to which the loan was to be devoted as a  further encroachment upon their integrity, of which the new Senate and the parliamentary party throughout the country  is especially jealous.  Furthermore, while the preliminary  agreement stipulated that the Americans  were to retain control of the bond issues,  the British, French and Germans are expected to demand an equal participation  requiring also that they become signatories to the final compact.  NEW YORK, Nov. 29.—A leading representative of the American banking syndicate denied that any hitch had occurred  in the Chinese loan. The appointment of  a foreign financial adviser had been clearly stipulated in the preliminary negotiations. The loaning syndiacte was made up  of J. P.

PARLIAMENT TO COME IN 1915  Half the Senators Appointed by Throne  and   the   Rest   Carefully   Selected  So  as to  Restrain   Radicalism.  PEKING, Oct. 3.—China took another  forward step to-day when at noon the  newly constituted Imperial Senate Was  opened by the Regent, Prince Chun.  There was little or no ceremony to mark  the historic event. In a brief address  Prince Chun stated that the wish of the  people was for a Parliamentary Government, and he commanded the Senators to  labor for this  consummation.  A Parliamentary building of ample dimensions will be constructed, but pending  its completion the sessions of the Senate  will be held in the rather narrow quarters  of the Daw College. The lack of room  was given as the reason for the exclusion  of representatives of the press from to- I  day's proceedings. The same rule was  applied to other outsiders, not even the ;  members of the Diplomatic Corps being  invited.  The Imperial Senate constitutes the second stage in the development of a popular representative Government. The  first was the inauguration a year ago of  the Provincial Assemblies. The crowning  event will be the establishment of a general Parliament, which is promised for  1915.  The Imperial Seriate is expected to demonstrate the fitness of the Chinese to help'  rule themselves and so prepare the way  for a genuinely representative Government. Certain classes,, especially the  merchants, are impatient for the fulfillment of the plans of the Throne, and  last June a delegation from the Provincial  Assemblies came to Peking and demanded  the immediate convocation of a national  Parliament. The memorial was rejected  and its authors were told that a constitutional Government proper would come  only at the end of the nine-year period of  preparation fixed by the late Dowager  Empress.  Affairs will move slowly, and the makeup of the Senate is sufficient guarantee  that the Throne will keep a firm hand  on that body and directly influence its actions. The radical reform element will be  held in restraint. Of the 200 members  100 were appointed by the Throne, while  none of the others, though they were  chosen by the Provincial Assemblies, was  admitted until his selection had been approved by the Viceroy of his province.  Those named by the Throne include  Imperial Manchu Princes and nobles, distinguished scholars, and representatives  of the official class and of the high taxpayers.	26256248 Bytes	1517	5765	2029249730	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510134011.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1794	1794	1795.jp2	/asm0400/image/1795.jp2

England Dominates the Customs—European Spheres of Influence—Foreign  Soldiers in Pekin—Warships to Subdue Strikers—What China Hopes For.  Pekin, June 1.—Whether true or false  the following story, now current in Pekin,  indicates the anomaly of the term "integrity of China," which finds place in  many international agreements.   ,.  Tl in said that representatives of the  Wai Wu Pu, the Chinese Foreign Office,  recently called at the British Legation  and suggested that Prince Tsi Tao be  invited to extend his European tour so  as to include a visit to England. The  Chinese officials were surprised and  chagrined, at the reply, which was to the  .effect that the present was hardly an  opportune time for the royal visit in view  1 of.the  disagreement  between  the  two  • Governments over the customs.  f Here was, a pretty pass for a member  ! of ,the : Celestial family! According to  \ Chinese ideas the Prince must now be  $ invited to England 'at any cost. So the  ; WaiWu Pu gave way at once on the cus-  ? toms controversy.  Before the Boxer outbreak the Chinese  ■ Government pledged itself to Great  ■Britain, in consideration of a substantial  j and much needed loan, to appoint only a  l British subject as supervisor or inspector-  I general of the customs as long as British  \ commerce with China remained predominant. : As with all such treaties the  Chinese have regretted the day they  j made it and have been endeavoring ever  ) einee to circumvent the agreement.  On one occasion they created a Gov-  ! ernmeat department which should have  [control, among; other matters, of the cus-  Jtoms.    Sir Robert Hart, then inspector,  j offered his resignation, refusing to withdraw it till the customs department was  ! again made independent.  \    The recent  promotion  of  Sir Robert  ' Breedon to the Shui Wu Chu, a similar  1 board (Sir Robert Breedon having been  | acting inspector since Sir Robert Hart's  , retirement), seemed to the British Gov-  i ernment another attempt upon the authority of the British customs inspector,  now Mr. Aglen, and they let it be known  that they would brook no interference  with the office even if one member of the  Shui Wu Chu were British.  The  controversy  went on for Several  JjWeeks   until   the   Prince   Tao   incident  ■brought it to an abrupt conclusion. When  »the Chinese explained to Sir Robert Breedon their dilemma it is said that he at  j once handed in his resignation in order  to make clear the way for the invitation  to Prince Tao to visit London.  Many of the young Chinese returning  from colleges in Japan, Europe and the  United States are fired with a new patriotism which is no longer simply a  hatred of foreigners. Many of them, despairing of the plight in which they find  their country, are looking to America  as the Power with the least territorial  and commercial interests here to help  restore the integrity of China.  But the United States would have much  to contend against in an effort to1 befriend these people politically, for innumerable rights which independent countries must of necessity retain have been  lost through China's military incapacity  or bartered away. To indicate how little  China controls her own • affairs to-day  it is only necessary to enumerate some of  the most flagrant extraterritorial conditions prevailing here.  There was recently some rioting in  the Province of Honan, primarily because  of a rice famine. As is always the case in  an outbreak in China some'of the wrath  of the people was turned upon the foreigners and some foreign property wTas  destroyed. Immediately foreign gunboats Steamed up the Yangtse-Kiang.  Imagine British, French, German and  ;■ Japanese men-o'-war entering the Mis-  • sissippi and proceeding up to St. Louis  rto overawe a body of strikers!  \ Nor is it only the foreign navies that  are represented within the borders of  China. In Pekin, the capital itself, every  , European Power as well as Japan and the  ^United States maintains a garrison, and  the heart of the city is reserved to the  'legations and the various foreign bar-  j racks.  I It is within the authority of the Legation  /police to eject any Chinaman from the  \jEuropean reservation; but on the other  hand the Chinese police may not lay  hands on a stranger except in case of  j murder or other violence. In any event  the foreigner must be handed over at  |onde to the custody of his own people,  to be tried by the consular court of his  J own coiintry or what is called the mixed  I (foreign) court.  I In the treaty ports the foreign quarters  \ were originally sections which the Chinese  Bet apart for the contemptuous segregation of the "Barbarians" or "Foreign  Devils" who were traders, in the opinion  of the East the lowest class of man;  but they are now quarters, fortified in  many instances, from which the Chinese  * may be excluded.  • A couple of days ago Pekin was informed by cable, not officially but by  a press telegram, tha*t England, France,  Germany and America had come to an  agreement with regard to the Hukuan  railway loan. While China has not yet  [been asked to sign the contract these  four Powers have allotted among themselves the several sections of the work  as well as the loans. It is decided for  '.China how and from whom she shall  borrow, where she shall purchase the  'railway materials, and the nationality  &gt;f the engineers who shall do the work.  It is not uncommon for a foreign Minister in Pekin to inform the Wai Wu Pu  that the Government is not at liberty  to purchase supplies for one of the various  departments from any but his country.  The Chinese are very loose with their  promises and foreign representatives  in this battleground of trade are given  to exacting pledges which no well governed country would ever be asked to  make.  Furthermore, the Powers in many  instances place their own construction  upon treaties, and sometimes, as in the  WTell known case of the Antung-Mukden  railway, enforce that construction by  show of arms.  Another country would be in a position  to forbid the importation of opium by legal  regulations; China must appeal to Great  Britain on moral grounds, and the latter  agrees to reduce the supply gradually on  the condition that China ,on her part will  stamp out the home production.  Several Powers, Japan, France, Germany and Russia, maintain their own post  offices. in Pekin and elsewhere throughout the empire. Over these offices the  Chinese Government has no jurisdiction,  nor is any compensation derived by China  from them, though they conflict seriously  with, the revenue of the Chinese posts.  Foreign banks issue their own paper  money and circulate it without interference arid'1'with out heed to the country's  protest. In fact it is feared by the Chinese  that tAese banks' profiting by the present  chaotic state of the monetary system will  endeavor to thwart the proposed monetary reform for which imperial edict has  just been issued.  It is hi story of course that the four fore  a railway. In south Manchuria Japan  exercises similar authority. Germany  holds by treaty mining and railway privileges and exerts her authority in the influence of German trade throughout the  province of Shantung. In Tonking France  is predominant, while Hongkong is British  territory by actual cession.  In the outlying western provinces beyond the Gobi Desert Russia maintains I  troops in certain important towns for the  protection of Russian Consuls and to preserve Russian interests.  The integrity of China is seriously impaired.	118029308 Bytes	3154	12472	4181328654	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510135011.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1795	1795	1796.jp2	/asm0400/image/1796.jp2

ORIGIN  AND  HISTORY  OF  THE  BOARD.  The United States Board on Geographic Names was created by an  Executive order issued by President Harrison September 4, 1890.  Prior to that date there was an unofficial organization, composed of  ten persons, all employed in the public service, all engaged in geographic work, and all keenly sensitive to the confusion and contradictions in geographic names as used in Government publications.  Originally the Board was composed of ten members. Its present  membership is thirteen, of whom two were original members. The  membership, past and present, together with Departments, bureaus,  offices, and institutions represented, is set forth in the following table:  DEPARTMENT  AND BUREAU.  Name.  Term of service.

Beach, Maj.W.D   Nov. 29,1905, to date.  Mr. T. C. Mendenhall was chairman from the creation of the Board  in 1890 until his departure from Washington in June, 1894, since  which time Mr. Gannett has filled this position, except for the period  from October 1, 1902, to October 14, 1903, when Major Lusk acted  as chairman. Mr. Clover served as secretary from the beginning  until October 6, 1891, and Mr. Baker from that date until his death,  December 12, 1903. Mr. A. H. Allen acted as secretary from January 6, 1904, to April 6, 1904, when Mr. C. S. Sloane was elected  secretary.  The Board has decided 5,133 cases. It has also, after an examination of the disputed cases, approved a certain form of spelling for the  names of the counties of the United States, numbering 2,876.  Shortly after the organization of the Board it was called upon to  decide several hundred cases of disputed names in Alaska, where the  nomenclature derived from native, Russian, Spanish, and English  sources was, as it still to some extent is, in great confusion. The  cases submitted were decided. It was seen, however, that nothing  short of a complete revision of all the names would satisfactorily  remove the existing confusion. This was made, and issued in 1901 as  Bulletin 187 of the Geological Survey, entitled "Geographic Dictionary of Alaska," which is now being revised.  ORIGIN  OF  AND  CHANGES  IN  GEOGRAPHIC  NAMES.  With the exception of the names of political subdivisions, geographic  names in this country have not, as a rule, been bestowed by any formal  authority. The names of natural features—rivers, lakes, mountains,  capes, etc.—and of unchartered bodies of population have received  their names originally from explorers, surveyors, and early settlers,  and these names have been perpetuated by common consent. The  names of states, counties, and municipalities of all classes, on the	57380276 Bytes	3424	5584	9091159	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510145091.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1845	1845	1846.jp2	/asm0400/image/1846.jp2

Differences of usage exist to a large extent, not only in the names  of natural features and unincorporated places, but even in those of  organized bodies of population whose names have been bestowed by  formal authority. These differences have originated in numerous  ways.  In the unsettled parts of the county different exploring expeditions,  ignoring the work of their predecessors, have given new names to  features already named. As elsewhere noted this difficulty has often  occurred in Alaska, which has been visited in recent years by numerous expeditions.  The transliteration of Indian names has everywhere been a fruitful  source of differences in spelling, inasmuch as no two persons understand alike or render into the same English characters the obscure  sounds of Indian names.  It often happens in the case of the larger geographic features, such  as extended mountain ranges, rivers, etc., that different names have  been applied locally in various parts and these names have become  well settled in usage.  It frequently happens that railroads adopt names for their stations  different from those of the towns or villages in which they are situated  and thus divide usage. To a much greater extent, however, than the  railroads has the Post Office Department confused the nomenclature  of the smaller towns and villages by attaching names to the post offices  not in accordance with those in local usage. Indeed, an examination  shows that there are in this country thousands of cases where the name  of the post office does not conform to the local name of the place in  which it is situated. These differences are very confusing to those  using the postal service, and it seems desirable to reduce their number  so far as practicable, at the same time recognizing the necessity of  having no post office name duplicated in a state.  By far the greater number of differences in usage, however, have  their origin in carelessness or ignorance on the part of those making  use of the names. Such errors appearing in print are frequently perpetuated, especially in popular works, and often supplant the original  name in usage.  Originating in these diversities of spelling there is distinctly traceable a development of geographic nomenclature which is, on the whole,  proceeding in a beneficial direction. Its tendency is toward the discarding of objectionable names and the adoption of pleasing ones, and  toward the simplification and abbreviation of names, particularly as  shown in the dropping of silent letters. The Board, recognizing this  course of development, deems it to be within its power to guide it  and even to forestall it, so far as its future course may be foreseen.	56052608 Bytes	3364	5552	3904776229	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510145101.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1846	1846	1847.jp2	/asm0400/image/1847.jp2

The extent to which geographic names have been modified without  being radically changed is scarcely appreciated. A large proportion,  pro*bably a majority, of the names of natural features have undergone  alterations in spelling to a greater or less extent since they were first  applied, while of the names of political divisions, although established  by formal act, a considerable proportion have also changed, and such  variations have, in thousands of cases, become firmly established.  Therefore, the position assumed by some persons, that we should revert  to the original forms of names, would, if carried out, result in changing  the names of a large proportion of our natural and artificial features.  POLICY   OF  THE   BOARD.  The Board is agreed that in general the name which is in common  local use at present should be adopted. This is a broad, general  principle, and summarizes the policy of the Board, with the exception of certain classes of names. It covers cases of changes or corruptions of names, except where the}7 are considered to be unworthy  of perpetuation.  The Board clearly recognizes that the importance and value of its  decisions depend upon their general adoption. To change corrupted  forms back to pure forms, after the corrupted form has been established, is to make a decision which will not be followed. Such decisions are not merely useless; they are positively harmful. The}7 tend  not to settle, but to unsettle usage. To restore such names as Port  Townsend to Port Townshend, Pysht to Psyche, Ozan to Aux anes,  Low Freight to L'eau frais, Sitka to Shitka, Possum to Opossum, is  not always possible, however desirable. The aim, therefore, of the  Board is to discover and support by its decisions the forms in use in  all cases, except those where specific and positive objections thereto  are found to exist. That it should always succeed in this aim is obviously impossible. Changes are constantly occurring. The Board can  not if it would, and would not if it could, oppose change.  The difficulties encountered in carrying out this principle are found  mainly in determining what is the established usage, or the prevailing  local practice where it is divided between different forms. Where it  is so divided, opportunity is afforded for the selection of the more  appropriate and euphonious of the names in use.  The Board considers it desirable to depart from local usage in certain  cases in order to effect reforms in nomenclature. Among these departures approved by the Board are the following:  (a) The avoidance, so far as seems practicable, of the possessive  form of names.  (b) The dropping of the final uh" in the termination "burgh."

(e) The discontinuance of the use of hyphens in connecting parts of  names.  (f) The omission, wherever practicable, of the letters "C. H."  (Court-House) after the names of county seats.  (g) The simplification of names consisting.of more than one word by  their combination into one word.  (A) The avoidance of the use of diacritic characters.  (i) The dropping of the words "city " and "town " as parts of names.  All of these changes are warranted by the direction of development.  The possessive form of name is rapidly disappearing, except in rare  cases where good reason exists for its retention. In most cases this  is effected by dropping the apostrophe and the final "s." In certain  cases, however, usage or euphony appears to require the retention of  the final "s," when the apostrophe only is dropped.  Concerning the termination "burg" or "burgh," as Pittsburg, an  extensive correspondence has developed the fact that in more than  three-fourths of the places having this termination the final "h"is  not in local use. The case of the termination "boro" or "borough,"  as Attleboro, is very similar. The present tendency is strongly  toward the substitution of the abbreviated form. The Board, therefore, deems it advisable to induce uniformity in this matter in the  manner indicated.  In the case of the word "center" as part of a name, as Mansfield  Center, Center Rutland, usage appears to be about equally divided  between "center" and "centre," and the Board has adopted the first  of the above forms of the word.  Hyphens in connecting parts of names appear to be useless, while  they add to the complexity of the spelling.  The practice of adding the letters "C. H.," meaning Court-House,  to the name of a county seat is prevalent, especially in the Southern  states. Frequently the place has two names, one being its charter  name, the other the name of the county with "C. H." appended; thus  the county seat of Raleigh county, W. Va., is known as Beckley and  as Raleigh C H.  The tendency toward simplification is in no way shown more decidedly than in the combination of the several words forming a name.  Thus "La Fayette" has become well nigh universally "Lafayette,"  and "El Dorado" has become "Eldorado." The Board approves this  tendency and will further it so far as possible without forestalling  usage too greatly.  The use of diacritic characters in geographic names in the United  States, such as the German umlaut and the Spanish tilde, is rapidly  disappearing. It would be impossible, even were it desirable, to oppose  this change.	56475136 Bytes	3409	5520	1715032316	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510145121.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1848	1848	1849.jp2	/asm0400/image/1849.jp2

The practice of adding the word "city" or "town," as Boise City,  Drummondtown, as a part of the name is a useless complication,  growing in most cases out of an optimistic spirit on the part of the  promoters of the place. It is often misleading and almost invariably  unnecessary.  There are in Alaska a good many names of Russian origin ending in  OBB, which terminating syllable has been variously rendered of, off,  ow, and ov. The Board uniformly uses of. Examples: Baranof,  Chichagof, Popof, and Shelikof.  Outside of the United States, where the Department of State and  United States Hydrographic Office are chiefly interested, the work of  the Board is directed to the harmonization of American usage in geographic nomenclature with the usage of the great map making nations—  England, Germany, and France. The Department of State, b}7 reason  of its diplomatic and consular functions, is intimately concerned with  the present style, change of names, transfers of territorial jurisdiction,  cession and acquisition of territory by various governments abroad,  and the proper forms of the titular political nomenclature of foreign  states and nations. The interest of the Hydrographic Office is involved  by reason of its publication of charts and sailing directions of all foreign waters, to the effective use of which uniformity of geographic  nomenclature is obviously indispensable. The forms of foreign names  recommended for adoption are determined on consultation of established usage, the best authorities upon ethnological and political history and derivation, and current geographic and political information  from authentic sources.  Many names in foreign civilized countries present a peculiar difficulty and appear to require that a further exception be made to the  general principle of following local usage. This lies in the fact that  many foreign names have been anglicized, and the anglicized form,  often quite different from the local form (meaning by local form that  in use by the best authorities in the country having jurisdiction), is  well established in usage in this country.  Such cases wherein English speaking nations use names differing  from those locally accepted are not numerous, but they are among  those most in use and represent the most prominent features of the  earth; for instance, we call Deutschland Germany, Espana Spain,  Livorno Leghorn. In many cases we translate the foreign name, if it  is capable of translation, into English words. Other countries, in turn,  treat the names of this country in a similar manner. Indeed, most  non-English speaking people translate the name of this country into  their own tongue, forgetting that geographic names, like personal  names, should not be translated.  It is unquestionably desirable and proper that local usage should be	56336352 Bytes	3390	5537	537564335	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510145131.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1849	1849	1850.jp2	/asm0400/image/1850.jp2

The people of the United States can not be induced to change from  Germany to Deutschland, or even from Italy to Italia, or The Hague to  's Gravenhage. It is a reform, however, to which we may look forward and work toward and which may be attained in the future.  It is understood by the Board that our charts of the coasts of foreign  countries using Roman characters, made for the use of our Navy and  merchant marine, generally require the use of the local forms of these  names, while on the other hand popular usage in this country, especially in our atlases and text-books, requires the anglicized form.  The Board practically leaves this matter on the same footing as heretofore, approving the use of local spelling of foreign names upon our  charts and the anglicized forms upon maps designed for use in this  country. It hopes, however, that the way may be open in the near  future to the adoption throughout, of the local and the rejection of the  anglicized forms. In such specific cases as have been brought to its  attention it has decided uniformly in favor of the local method.  Most of the nations of Europe, either through national boards or  geographic societies, are engaged in the regulation of the orthography  of geographic names. Their attention has been particularly directed  toward producing uniformity in the transliteration of aboriginal names  written in characters other than Roman. These nations have practically agreed upon a system of transliteration, which, with one or two  exceptions, has been adopted by this Board, thus coming into practical  agreement in this matter with the rest of the civilized world.  SCOPE  OF  ITS  FUNCTIONS.  From the wording of the Executive order creating the Board it  has uniformly maintained that its function is limited to the consideration of names as to which there is diverse usage. Under the Executive order of January 23, 1906, there was added to the duties of the  Board, the duty of determining, changing, and fixing place names  within the United States and insular possessions. It does not give  names to features, though frequently called upon to do so. It does  not, though frequently appealed to, deal with the question of pronunciation. It does not determine the generic character of the feature  whose name is in dispute. It does not determine whether a stream is  a creek or river; whether a body of water is a lake or pond; whether  an elevated tract is a hill or mountain.  The Board does not attempt wholesale reformation of corrupted  names nor seek to restore original forms or pure forms, nor does it  attach much importance to priority. It would be idle to attempt to  22400—07 2	56469128 Bytes	3408	5521	1094614002	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510145141.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1850	1850	1851.jp2	/asm0400/image/1851.jp2

Whatever diverse usage may be found in print, whatever departures from or corruptions of old forms are involved in such  names, any attempt to restore first forms would not contribute to  establishing uniform usage. These old names are of interest to the  antiquarian and scholar, but a stumbling block in the path of the man  of affairs who wants to know the name now and how it should be  spelled. As a rule, names are dealt with individually. If it appears  that present practice is fairly consistent or established as to any name,  that form is, in general, adopted.  All the foregoing are things which the Board does not do. What  it actually does is to consider, one by one, names brought to its attention as disputed. This dispute or discrepant use may exist in print or  in speech, or in both. The Board, collecting all the facts deemed pertinent in each case, sifts them, weighs them, and decides what the name  is and how the Executive Departments are to spell it. Under authority  of the Executive order of January 23, 1906, the Board will control the  place names of the country as far as Government usage is concerned.  It will discard such as are objectionable, replacing them with appropriate names. It will publish and promulgate principles for the  guidance of explorers and surveyors in the selection of suitable names.  It will examine and decide upon names proposed for newly-discovered  and unnamed features, and accept or reject those proposed. Its decisions are the " standard authority " for these Departments. If they  are followed by the newspapers, the schools, the publishers, dictionary  makers, and private map makers, a long step has been taken toward  securing the uniformity so much to be desired.  There are three counties in the United States bearing the Indian  name Pottawatomie, one each in Kansas and Oklahoma written Pottawatomie, and one in Iowa spelled Pottawattamie. The Board deems  it desirable that the spelling of these names should be uniform, but it  finds here "no unsettled question concerning geographic names" to  be considered.  Similarly, five counties, a large city, a river, a mountain range, and  various minor features bear the name Allegany. The word is spelled  in three ways, each well established and thus not coming within the  scope of the Board's functions. New York and Maryland each has  an Allegany county; North Carolina and Virginia an Alleghany county,  and Pennsylvania an Allegheny county. As to these respective counties  the Board finds no diversity of usage and accepts the forms it finds.  In the case of the river and mountains it finds diverse usage, and for  these has adopted the form Allegheny,  I	57097116 Bytes	3423	5558	1379662955	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510145151.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1851	1851	1852.jp2	/asm0400/image/1852.jp2

The Board in this case spells the name Vermilion,  irrespective of local usage, which is in some cases Vermillion, deeming the change so trifling and the gain in uniformity so great as to  warrant this course.  The dropping of the "h" at the end of the termination "burg" has  been uniformly followed by the Board, even where, as in some cases,  this decision has conflicted with local usage. Thus it writes Lunenburg, Mecklenburg, Orangeburg, Spartanburg, Vanderburg, and  Williamsburg as the names of counties in Virginia, Indiana, North  Carolina, and South Carolina.  Puerto Rico, meaning rich port, is the Spanish name of one of the  West Indies acquired by the United States in 1898. In 1891 the Board  adopted this form, conforming to the invariable local usage of that  time and also to the practice of the country having jurisdiction. An  act of Congress approved April 12, 1900, has established the form  Porto Rico as the name of the island.  HOW  DECISIONS  ARE  MADE.  Cases brought to the Board for decision are at once referred to the  executive committee for examination and report. This committee  examines each case, consulting printed authorities, such as mother  maps, gazetteers, local historians, atlases, etc. Especially does it seek  after, and it generally obtains, the local usage, to which it attaches  great importance. Local usage is usually obtained by correspondence  with county clerks, postmasters, and residents who are conversant  with local conditions. This information derived from correspondence  is often supplemented by the oral testimony of individuals having personal knowledge of the name under consideration. The information  needful for deciding may be obtained quickly, within a day or two, or  it ma}7 take months. When the executive committee is satisfied, it  tabulates the results on cards, which are printed blanks whereon spaces  are left for entering various items of information. When all the data  are tabulated the members of the executive committee record their  preferences, signing their initials. Thus there is a record vote of the  executive committee. The cards so prepared are submitted to the  Board at its regular monthly meetings, and considered one by one.  Usually the executive committee agrees on its recommendations.  Not infrequently, however, there is a divided report. The case being  submitted to the Board, a vote is taken, and a majority, not of those  present, but of the whole Board, is necessary to decide. The decision so  reached is written at the top of the card, which is thereupon stamped  Approved, with the date of the approval. Usually, from one to several  cases at each meeting, are by the Board sent back to the committee for	57103632 Bytes	3424	5557	1566741413	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510145161.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1852	1852	1853.jp2	/asm0400/image/1853.jp2

"       H.G.O.  Such is the present practice of the Board, gradually developed as the  outcome of experience. The principles which govern decisions were  at the outset considered and formulated with great painstaking and care.  They were the subjects of many and earnest discussions, and it is a matter on which the Board congratulates itself that these principles so  elaborated and adopted have so well stood the test of usage. While  experience has improved practice in the Board's operations, it has contributed practically nothing in the way of principles.  PRINCIPLES  FOR  SPECIAL  APPLICATION  IN  THE  UNITED  STATES.  It must be understood that these are not designed as rules, but as  guiding principles, from which the Board reserves liberty to depart  whenever, in its judgment9 it deems it advisable to do so.  Euphonious and suitable names of Indian, Spanish, or French origin  should be retained.  Names suggested by peculiarities of the topographic features designated—such as their form, vegetation, or animal life—are generally  acceptable, but duplication of names, especially within one state,  should be avoided. The names "Elk," "Beaver," "Cottonwood,"  and "Bald" are altogether too numerous.  Names of living persons should be applied very rarely, and only  those of great eminence should be thus honored. No personal names  should be attached because of relationship, friendship, or personal  interest, nor should names of obscure persons be given. Names of  eminent men now dead may be thus perpetuated, particularly those of  early explorers, naturalists, geologists, topographers, etc.  Long and clumsily constructed names and names composed of two  or more words should be avoided. It is a foregone conclusion that  such names will not be adopted by the public.    If the name selected	57247952 Bytes	3421	5576	2881731094	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510145171.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1853	1853	1854.jp2	/asm0400/image/1854.jp2

The multiplication of names for different parts of the same feature,  such as a river or mountain range, should be avoided. Only one name  should be applied to a stream or mountain range throughout its entire  length; in the case of a river the name should follow up its longest  branch.  The naming of forks, prongs, branches, etc., as "East Fork" or  "North Prong" of a river, should be avoided unless there is a special  reason for it. In most cases, independent names should be given to a  river's branches.  That spelling and pronunciation which is sanctioned by local usage  should, in general, be adopted.  Where names have been changed or corrupted, and such changes or  corruptions have become established by local usage, it is not usually  advisable to attempt to restore the original form.  In cases where what was evidently originally the same word appears  with various spellings sanctioned by local usage, when applied to  various features, these various spellings should be regarded as in  effect different names, and, as a rule, it is inadvisable to attempt to  produce uniformity.  Where a choice is offered between two or more names for the same  place or locality, all sanctioned by local usage, that which is most  appropriate and euphonious should be adopted.  The possessive form should be avoided whenever it can be done  without destroying the euphony of the name or changing its descriptive application.  In names ending in " burgh" the final "h" should be dropped.  Names ending in " borough" should be abbreviated to "boro."  The word "center," as a part of a name, should be spelled as above,  and not "centre."  The use of hyphens in connecting parts of names should be discontinued.  The letters " C. H." (Court-House) appended to the names of county  seats should be omitted.  In the case of names consisting of more than one word it is sometimes desirable to combine them into one word.  It is desirable to avoid the use of diacritic characters.  It is desirable to avoid the use of the words city and town as parts  of names.  PRINCIPLES  FOR  SPECIAL  APPLICATION  IN  FOREIGN  COUNTRIES.

(2) The spelling of geographic names that require transliteration  into Roman characters should represent the principal sounds of the  word as pronounced in the native tongue, in accordance with the  sounds of the letters in the following system.  An approximation only to the true sound is aimed at in this system.  The vowels are to be pronounced as in Italian and on the Continent of  Europe generally, and the consonants as in English:  a has the sound of a in father.    Examples: Java, Banana, Somali, Bari.  e has the sound of e in men.    Examples: Tel el Kebir, Medina, Peru.  i has the sound of i in ravine, or the sound of ee in beet.    Examples: Fiji, Hindi.  o has the sound of o in mote.  u has the sound of oo in boot.    Examples: Umnak, Unga.  ai has the sound of i in ice.    Example: Shanghai.  ao is slightly different from above.    Example: Nanao.  ei has the sound of the two Italian vowels, but is frequently slurred over, when  it is scarcely distinguishable from ey in the English they.    Examples:  Beirut, Beilul.  c is always soft, and has nearly the sound of s; hard c is given byk.    Example:  Celebes.  ch is always soft, as in church.    Example: Chingchin.  f as in English; ph should not be used for this sound.    Thus, not Haiphong,  but Haifong.  g is always hard (soft g is given by j).    Example: Galapagos.  h is always pronounced when inserted.  j as in English; dj should never be put for this sound.    Examples: Japan,  Jinchuen.  k as in English.    It should always be used for the hard c.    Thus, not Corea,  but Korea,  kh has the sound of the oriental gutteral.    Example: Khan.  gh is another gutteral, as in the Turkish: Dagh, Ghazi.  ng1 has two slightly different sounds, as in finger, singer.  q should never be employed; qu is given by kw.    Example: Kwangtung.  as in English.  y is always a consonant, as in yard, and should not be used for the vowel i.  Thus, not Mikindany, but Mikindani.  All vowels are shortened in sound by doubling the following consonant.  Examples: Yarra, Tanna, Jidda, Bonni.  Doubling a vowel is only necessary where there is a distinct repetition of the  single sound.    Example: Nuulua.  Accents should not, generally, be used; but where there is a very decided  emphatic syllable or stress which affects the sound of the word it should  be marked by an acute accent.   Examples: Tongatdbu, Galapagos, Palawan,  Sarawak.  b,  d,  li  m,  n,  P&gt;  r,  s,  t,  v,  w,  x,  and  z	56454172 Bytes	3393	5544	990834512	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510145191.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1855	1855	1856.jp2	/asm0400/image/1856.jp2

The following is &  brief account of sources of information of the following paper on Chinese Music.  The first work quoted by a jSwropean is "Memories of Chinese Music11  both Ancient and Modern" published in 2 7.76 by M. Amiot, a French  missionary,  Nothing of importance appeared between this date ar?J 1884 when an  authoritative work was published in London by J. A. Van Akl&$*     It  contains a number of original airs and texts.    The "Historic Uem&iTB  of Sema T'Sun" translated by Ed Chavannes, Prof, of the College of  France in 189? is a monument of learning and critique,  A modern  Trench work by Laioy is a brief resume of these three sources- with  reference to original Chinese authors- (There are 482 books on Music  in the Pekin Library.)  Louis Elson in his "Curiosities of Music" has  three delightfully written chapters devoted to the Chinese.  I am chiefly indebted to Laloy and have embodied a few pages of his  comments in free translation.  C. M. Von Weber's "Turandot Overture" is an excellent European adaptation of original Chinese melodies, the principal themes being for  drum 9nd  flute.  This was composed in lo05 and was the direct result  of a sort of frolic on the part of Weber and his companions, who had  been ransacking foreign material in order to procure worae Saracenic  motives for a Sicilian Romance.  The Chinese are commonly accused of having no music worth the  name, because to our ears it seems mere noise and discord.  $ne author goes so far as to close a very brief notice of it by  exclaiming "He eught perhaps to apologize for saying s£ much of it,"  Tis surely strange that the same sounds should inspire disgust to  European ears and rapture to the Chinese.  Balzac is picturesque in his denunciation, comparing the Chinamanfs  voice in singing to a dog yawning or a cat choking over a toad and  every traveler and every writer seems to concur more or less in these  unflattering verdicts.  But no matter how barbarous the sounds are to us, the subject shsul  not be approached flippantly, nor should final conclusions be hastily  drawn, for a people that seriously studied music 4ooo years ago, and  has grasped the abstract fundamental principles of the science centuries before Pythagoras, a people that could boast of a "Bureau of Music  befpre Apollo held his lyre, and a people whose writings are pervaded  by a rapturous exaltation of the art, surely deserves sympathetic and  patient consideration,Y snd this is true concerning not only music, but  every  other phase of ^heir life and history.  To begin with, we ought to define music.  One of the best authorities defines it thus- "The art of moving the feelings by combinations  of sounds."

He could enjoy a  rollicking boat song, but classical music, so he said, made him  feel as though rats were gnawing at the base of his brain.  Now  there was surel}' something wrong with his ear, an^/it has occurred  to me that as the Chinaman's eye is on the slant, perhaps he hears  on the slant and what to us is but jangling discord, may indeed be  heSWttJLy harmony to him- tis said in fact that in theatrical performances where V*W seems as though the actors' voices were farrly d  drowned by the intoler^?A^ din and clash of instruments, this pandemonium appears to give only a Vimeruil delight to the  Chinese  audience*  I find that physiologists have indeed been led to w/OT-der if the  anatomical structure of the Chinese ear be fundamentally diffeT^.t  from ours, just as it has also been argued that the Tyrol^se must  have peculiarly constructed throats enabling them to "jo^el".  In regard to the deafening din at every Chinese theatrical per*  formance, Jhere is a contention that this very din has the effect  of precluding any distraction of the sense of hearing, by enveloping it in an overwhelming sea of sound.  The shrill falsetto declamation and the accompanying pantomime are thus made to stand out in  bold relief- in other words, tis the sort of background and atmosphere the Chimr      Is conducive i a.  This orchestral blare of every known and unknown instrument may  serve some artistic purpose, like the Greek chorus, emphasizing here,  suggesting fehere, the appropriate emotion; or may it be perhaps that  the whole scenic representation, requires this tumultuous conjuring  up, much as the hive about to swarm is hypnotised by the banging of  kettles0  Perhaps silence, such as we demand, would act like a wet blanket  and dispel the charm.  Speculations of this nature may not lead us  very far, but they will not be wholly futile if they serve to dis;  prejudice and inculcate tolerance and candor in our judgmentsA"  Setting aside for the present all the uncomplimentary things said aldput  Chinese music, it can be posi timely shewn that even from our me dew  western European standpoint, the Chinaman is a born music lover and-  an apt pupil. *  The hymn singing taught by missionaries■is said to be remarkable  for spirit and beauty of tone; and even elaborate part singing has  been successfully attempted.  They show enthusiasm and intelligence  and it has been said that he who makes the songs for the great  future China will have perhaps hardly less influence than he who  makes the laws.  There have been repeated efforts by Europeans to introduce Western  instruments, notation and harmonies and even reformers from within  have sought to adopt innovations, but for reasons I shall dwell on  later, these efforts have been almost entirely futile.  The great stability  T  of China, of her institutions and ideals, has  prevailed in music as  elsewhere, giving use to  the oft repeated re  proach of her being a  "living fossil ."  -/  There is one peculiarity of Chinese speech which has great musical  significance.

With such elements at hand, it seems as though it should be possible to combine word and tone in a most delicate and effective manner  affording the greatest scope and flexibility in musical expression.  The earliest Chinese literature teems with fables and anecdotes and  references to the art and power of music.  The same mythical emperor  who invented rules of pronunciation and yvritten characters, discovered musical notes, which are derived, theNancient sages say, from  souhds in nature, from the bubbling waters, from the notes of male  birds, from the notes of female birds and from breathing through  bamboo tubes .  Musical sounds -     are of eight kinds, nature having formed  eight kinds of sonorous bodies, viz:  1 stretched skin, result, the drum  result stone kings  result, bells and trumpets  result, whistles  result, twisted strings  result, castanets, etc.  result, reeds and flutes  result, sounding board  These eight different kinds ©f instruments are poetically named  as fpr example,  "Love the People"  "Don't cut the trees"  "Cultivate the eight different grains"  "imitate the virtues of earth"  "Recall the memory of existing things"  etc.  Thus each instrument has its prescribed character and significance.  The result is a blending of poetic and practical ideas, ©r a distinction between them, which it is easy to see might remain quite unintelligible to the outsider.  Step by step, in the ancient days the laws o  of sound and of proportion were evolved and established.  M. Amiot believes that Egypt/and Greece derived from China the foundation of their  musical systems./ Although the Chinese knew the chromatic scale of  twelve tones- (12 corresponding to the 12 months and partaking of astronomical qualities) and although they knew the intervals of fifths  and octaves, they selected a scale of five tones only known as the  "Pentatonic", the oldest system of all.  Here again, each tone of the  scale has its own peculiar properties.  Five, be it remembered, was a sacred number and had mystical significance, there were five elements, five virtues, five senses, five  duties, five principle ceremonies, etc,^  The pitch of the Chinese scale was fixed 2600 B. C. and bells were  cast to perpetuate it forever.  As early as 2200 B. C. songs were  written in praise of agriculture, songs celebrating courtesy, the  beauties of concord arid good will and the interdependence of man.  Here we see the association of high thoughts and thems, which would  account for music so captivating the old philosophers.  When Confucius first heard some of the ancient songs, the music ©f  "Chun" 2300 B. C, the effect on him was so marvelous he could hardly  eat for three whole months.  In his later yea.rs, reduced to the extremity ©f poverty and starvation, he never lost the impulse to sing &n&.  play, saying "The wise man seeks by music to strengthen the weakness  of his soul, the thoughtless one uses it to stifle his fears."	86971356 Bytes	4525	6405	408515807	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510146031.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1858	1858	1859.jp2	/asm0400/image/1859.jp2

There were conquerors and jealous rulers wishing to undo works and records that  outdid their own.  In 245 B# C. one iconoclast of the Tchin dynasty  ordered all old literary and musical works destroyed.  He wished to  obliterate the past and substitute a new standard.  Only works on  agriculture and medicine were exempt and his reason for destroying  all other literature was that the ancient books did not suit that era  that they were a hindrance to progress, and caused the people to neglect agriculture-'Which he deemed the only foundation of true happiness  and prosperity.  Fortunately it was possible to evade his edicts to some extent.  Bells could be buried and likewise the "Kings" so that ancient tradition and arts were not wholly extinquished, but later philosophers  lament that in the great holocaust the ancient pitch and system of  modulation were lost, and therefore the art of regulating the heart by  means of music declined, and instead it served too oft to inflame the  baser passions.  The pendulum continued to swing back and forth.  These were strenuous beneficient reformers and there were effeminate sovereigns addicte  to ballet girls.  One emperor bestowed two provinces upon a pair of  fa.vorite musicians, another, a la Nero, took to the stage himself.  The Chinese feudal system was in theory ideally perfect.  The Emperor was presumed to be endowed with divine attributes.  He ordained  laws and composed hymns inculcating all the virtues.  But-many fell from grace.  A certain,old Due Ping, it is related,  once heard by accident a seductive melody.  He further insisted on  learning it and playing it.  Having lean€h&, he demanded more of the  same, until at last heaven was outranged. "Monstrous clouds arose, a  win$ blew violently, overturning and butyirig the erring mortal and  after this the kingdom was visited with such\a drouth/that the earth  was red for three years.  Thus did a frivolous, profane tast cause a  grave and dire calamity.  x'.   The fact is never to be lost sight of in considering Chinese art  and music, that the mental picture or symbol seems to be far more captivating to theChinese soul than any actual form or sound.  The form  and sound is ever subservient to the spiritual conception.  This fact  seems to me to account for the difficulty in adopting any new thing  when we reflect that each tone has its moral significance and precept  that each instrument and even every part of each instrument symbolizes  some abstract idea, we can easily see that to discard all this, would  be like embarking on an unknown sea, without compass or rudder.  The French missionary, /*miot, the Portuguese Father Perira, made  valiant attempts to convert the heathen, (musically speaking) and late  embassies tried numerous experiments and expedients along these lines,  all to no  purpose.  After playing the most beautiful sonatas and melodious airs, Amiot  exclaims "I saw upon their countenances only a cold and vacant look,  which announced to me that I had not touched them in the least."  "One  day", he continues, "I asked them how they liked our music and begged  them tjat tjey would tell me frankly what they thought.  They answered  in their politest way that our melodies were not made for their ears,  nor their ears for our melodies .  It was not therefore surprising they  could not find beauties in our meiodies as they could in their own."  They said "The melodies, of our music nass,from the ear to the heart,  and from the heart to the soul.  We feel them and we understand them.	83068108 Bytes	4417	6267	642939362	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510146041.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1859	1859	1860.jp2	/asm0400/image/1860.jp2

The  airs of our ancient music were something quite different.  One needed  but to hear them to be ra.vished with them.f  Our music seems to be chiefly disliked by the Chinese because it is  often played so quickly.  "To what purpose',1 they say, "should one  hurry in this way?  How can things thus penetrate to the soul? With  us," they add, "All is done calmly, without precipitation."  The only western instrument or music which has appealed to the  Chinese is the bagpipe and the Scottish reel.  Perhaps the five-toned  scale, so beloved by the Celtic peoples, as well as the primitive  bagpipe drone, seemed akin to their own refrains.  After all, the Chinaman on his native heath is, I feel sure, a born  music lover.  The world to him is full of sound and his soul craves  sound.  Silence is meant to be conquered by noise.  According to his  idea, every motion ought to have its appropriate sound.  The shrill  creak of his wheelbarrow, the rattle and bang of his springless carts  are but pleasing accompaniments.  The donkeys have clattering bells ad  the Japanese j in-rick-sha,f recently imported, rubber-tired and noiseless, must perforce have a piece of tine tied to the wheels.  The  boat trackers' songs and "timing songs" of the laborers, driving piles  and the like, are an endless sing song repetition, sometimes containin  long legendary poems in plaintive recitative.  The music of motion is  carried out in wierd and fantastic fashion.  If they do not have the scripture^ "harps on trees" they do have win  bells of gilded Stopper swinging from the angles of their tip-tilted  roofs.  Even the pigeonn are made musical, a- whistle being fastened  under the bird's wing so that in flight a surprising and fascinating  whirr is sent down, a mellow, elfin, aeolian meoldy.  There are  twenty different kinds of pigeon whistles ma.de of bamboo tubes or  slender gourds scraped to paper thinness and as light as thistle  do\¥n.  Prepare yourself for a sudden descent from this rhapsodical flight,  for be it added, these poetical whistles so ingeniously devised, ^re  in reality, but the practical carriers of bankers' messages and stock  quotations, a rude disillusion surely.  I am aware that the everpresent love of noise which so impresses  every foreigh viator has often been quite differently explained.  Just  as in their pictorial art and architecture the grotesque runs rampant,  and is accounted for by the belief that thereby evil spirits may be  kept away, &lt;#© in their customs and devices regarding so-called music,  they may have a similar purpose.  "The scaly dragons sprouting from eaves, or coiled like rampant  shrimps on theridge poles, the fiends riding mythical monsters, and  dogs and lions parading down every angle" have their counterpart in  the booming sepulctral horns, the deadening clarinet, the eight different kinds of drums and as many gongs used on ceremonial occasions  to exorcise demons.  The newly wedded for instance must not fail to have their future  house "sounded" (much as we could fumigate) to ensure future welfare.  Prom descriptions I do not know whether this or the death-bed and  fumeral service would prove the most nerveracking.  However, sounds  to us provocative of madness, no doubt diminish the Chinaman's grief  and enhance his joy.  The belief in an innumerable host of wandering  ghosts or devils representing the unburied dead, who everywhere have  to be propitiated, cheated, evaded or terrorrised, naturally calls  for extreme measures and the priestu  the tain tarn, the cra,sh of cymbals  and tumult of firework are evidently on occasion found woothing and  comforting to the Chinese soul.

Streets are full of music-makers and trade cries.  Every event,  great and small has its musical celebration, but all is mapped  out Bnd  adhered to.    ^^  Society in ancient times was moulded in fixed types- not made  up of complex changing elements.  Society in China has continued  to be of this fixed character.  Music, therefore has become an  institution with fixed laws.  Music is designed to inculcate the  necessary virtues.  Virtue is the cornerstone of human nature.  Music is the flower of virtue.  Thus read their aphorisms  In addition, however, to the exalted moral exhortations, there  is a most practical and prosaic trend, in that the daily and  necessary axts of life are all linked to song and dance.  Chinese dances are labelled thus  The joys of Harvest  The Fatigues of war  The skill of hunting  The labors of agriculture  Our eminently practical and c^nny  celestial brother would seem  to have invented a. "Tom Sawyer? philosophy which would certainly  have edified Kark Twain.  (Perhaps, in fact, it did.)  I may mention here a volume written about 1?00 A. D. treating  of "The Dance".  The missionary alluding to this work says he dares  not translate it lest he should be accused of placing the sentiments  pf the most noble psalms in/the mouth of the Chinese.  We have all been taught to marvel at the -reeks, at their theory  of the symmetry of life.  The interplay of outer and inner graces  is cited as the acme of artistic endeavor.  Here we seem to find  the same exalted ideal in the Chinese.  There is the same trinity  of arts, music , poetry and the dance.  At thirteen years of age, music was taught so that the child  could sing poetry and that the wise maxims/ contained in the verse  be engraven on his memory.  Religious and ceremonial vocal music /is solemn if monotonous and  without rhythm, but not wholly excruciating.  Quite otherwise it  must be admitted is the ordinary vocal composition.  The composer  seems to have a special pen chant f^f  long and sudden skips.  There  is neither beginning nor end to the tunes and every note seems out  of place.  On the whole vocal music does not seem to be held in very  high esteem by the Chinese themselves.  Their ballads are notoriously  sensual and thenoted singers are found outside of the domestic circle.  Few travelers have heard a musical Chinese lady sing.  Those who have  say it is the most torturing of all Chinese sounds.  From nose and  mouth issue most droning hideous noises.  Yet, in speaking, the Chinese voice is said to have a very clear  flute-like sound.  Men sing in a. high falsetto- a wierd recitative.  It is as though something inside the man was making a noise, not the  m$n  himself.  There are sudden^and surprising skips, unexpected  endings and the tune, if tune it be, is elusive, incomplete.  Much  skill and training is devoted to producing ventriloquist effects, and  the art of perfecting on instruments is likeivise made so intricate and  bewildering, so ahtruse and difficult, that no sight reading is possible, and meary has to be wholly relied on.

There are eight kinds of drums in common use, both large and small  &n£  variously shaped.  One large keg( shaped drum, set on a pedestal  is variously named according to the decoration, be they storm clouds  or birds of good omen or white swan.  Another large drum has a small  ^ne  attached on each side, shaped like a kitchen pot, to be struck  alternately.  There are small drums hung on strings with knotted ends which,  when  twirled make a noise like a rattle- other drums a.re filled with  rice grains.  Both drums and sticks are often covered with paintings,  doubtless with symbolic meaning.  The systematic use of stone to  produce musical sounds iis a peculiarly Chinese institution.  The  stones are shaped and carved so that when struck, the regular notes  of the scale are produced.  The stones pre called "Kings."  In 2250  Bx C-£ these stones were received as tribute.  Those found on the  banks of streams and mountain torrents were especially esteemed, y  I  yielding clear pure tones.  They were polished like agate, of many  hues, either single colors or five colors blended.  The stones are  shaped like a carpenter's squa.re, or sometimes like a. fish or a bat,  and are suspended in rows or series on a. frame.  The modern glass  ha.rmonica is the only counterpart of this ancient and unique instrument   The stones are struck with a stick or mallet.  It is a very  delica,te matter to carry out the ca.rving and ornamentation so as  not to interfere with the pitch.  The tinkle of jade is said to  be  especially lovely, yielding heavenly harmonies.  It was the music of the "Kings;1 composed by the great Fmperor  "Chun" about 2300 B{-  C. that so captivated Confucius  The "King"  blends best of any with the human voice.  A peculiar effect in unison playing is produced by sixteen bells  tuned in unison with sixteen "Kings".  All chronicles are filled  with praise of this unusual instrument.  "Its harmonious sounds invites the sage to think of the end of life."  Bell founding is said to have originated in China,.  The casting of  bells was a mysterious ceremony  Bell towers and drum towers are  erected at cross roads and streets where traffic is thickest.  Out of baked clay shrill and piercing whistles are made.  Out of  wood, castanets and divers shaped boxes, in one of which a sort of tat  too or clatter produced by a vibrating hammer, the sages assure us,  represents the advantages ©f social intercourse B.ni.   the natural benefits of society.

Three times repeated it is  equivalent to ringing down the curtain.  Another so-called instrument is a flag displayed during the per  formance  the time  The two most noted and beloved instruments, aside from  honored "Kings" are the "Cheng" and the "Kin".  The "Cheng  is made of a small gourd or calabash, which serves as air reservoir.  Into this gourd bamboo tubes are inserted and a mouth piece.  It embodies the principles of the reed organ and a.ccordion and was invented  4000 years ago.  There is of course, the customary mystical symbolism.  The upper part is rounded like heaven, the lower part flattened like  the earth and the interior is the abode of dragons, 1. e. the breezes  of heaven.  It has been celebrated in classic literature since time  began and is known as a "prohibition", since it curbs and suppresses  evil passions and rectifies the human heart.  The "Kin* is a sort of lute as large as a harp but mer like a  zither.  The "Kin" now used has seven strings, but many more strings  were common.  A very large "Kin" called a "Che" had even *.0   strings.  The strings are of twisted silk, (as many as eighty strands being  used.)  There are twenty-four virtues to be attained in playing the lute.  The tones produced ween to be the most poetic and delicate if one  j   judge fro:n the fervent utterances eulogizing it.  To illustrate the difficult art of playing the "Kin" and the intricate1 rules and almost sacrificial preparatory rites, I must quote  staining the second virtue that of Purity.  &gt;eek  it is a  sign of  is  sign \©f unquiet fin-  impurk fingers.

The heart must be pure"  Another note praising the lute says, "The sound of the lute is as  delicate to the ear as to the palate the swallow's nest, a dish without substance, an evanescent savor which brings with it the remembrance of seabreezes", and again, "The lute is the sister of silence."  The flute is a. favorite instrument, and at social gatherings it is  passed from one to another and a. sort of improvised musical conversa.Q  tien carried on.  It is s id by Laloy that nothing is more delightful  than listening to these fitful melodies, rising and falling, no sooner  heard than dissolved, of such shadowy grace that the earth seems  melting away.  Echoes vibrate and the most subtle shades of meaning ar  cenveyed without any attempt at virtuosity- the fingers like the heart  remain calm- it is a fantasie imbued with serenity.

Special Collections	Woman's Club of Coconut Grove Records	ASM0400										asm0400000151						asm04000001510155021		FORESTRY DEPARTMENT.  The Committee on Forestry of the Florida State Federation of Women's  Clubs offer to the Forestry Committees of Clubs this suggestive outline  for work.  If every club will hold one forestry day or accomplish practical work  in tree planting, tree preservation, reforesting waste land, if committees  will arouse an interest in a single line of work which helps to improve  tree life, public sentiment will be strengthened, and the forestry interests  of Florida will receive much-needed support. Gifford Pinehot, in the  Forestry Primer, says: "Except China, all civilized nations care for the  forest. Until recently the United States ranked nearly with China in this  respect, and our country still remains far behind the progressive modern  nations in nearly all that relates to the protection, preservation, and  conservative use of forests. . . . The forests of the United States  cover an area of almost 35 per cent, of the surface of the country. Before  iso large a part was destroyed, they were perhaps the richest on the earth,  and with proper care they are capable of being so again."  Assistance or information will be willingly given to club women if  letters are addressed to  Mrs. T. M. Shackleford, Chairman.  PRACTICAL WORK FOR CLUBS.  I.  Tree planting on roadsides, in school yards, or reforesting waste land.  Memorial tree planting.  A visit to a wood lot with practical talk by the State forester.  A demonstration of correct tree planting.  n.  Protection from mutilation (wire guards).  Protection from being felled  (State laws).  Protection from tree pests (native birds).  in.  Vacant lots reforested as nurseries for local use or as tree nurseries  for schools.  Unsightly spots made beautiful by trees, shrubbery and vines.  IV.  Planting of berry-bearing trees and shrubs as bird food—mountain ash,  mulberry, hackberry, cedar, etc.  v.  Preservation of roadside shrubbery and fringe trees on wood lots to  be lumbered.  Encourage scientific lumbering of woodlands.  VI.  Tree nurseries in school gardens, distribution of tree seeds to children  for school and home gardens.	53660228 Bytes	3772	4740	1522615500	RGB	8	600	asm04000001510155021.tif		2013-02-28	2013-02-28	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1886	1886	1887.jp2	/asm0400/image/1887.jp2

DADE COUNTY  TO GO TO THE  AND PLANTS  MICHIGAN STATE FAIR  LONG LIST OF FRUITS  MADE   UP  EXHIBtTj  The Detroit Free Press tells of the  interest which Dade county's exhibit  at the Michigan state fair aroused  among the vast number of visitors.  In a recent issue it says:  "A great deal of interest is being  taken in the Florida exhibit of tropical fruits by Mrs, Florence P.Haden  from Cocoanut Grove, Fla.  "It is surprising what a lot of fruits  grow in southern Florida, that were  never heard of by the mass of peopel  in our nothern states."  "In one corner is shown a cocoanut  leaf fourteen feet long, while the grown  cocoanut   in   its   shell   and   the   young;  fruit on another branch and the bios- !  som just bursting from its pod, attract  much attention.  "The ceriman is another crious  fruit, resembling a large ear of green  corn. The alligator pears, melon pawpaws, mammee apples, sugar apples,  Tahita apples, carissa and many other  strange fruits have been shown, and,  the better known fruits, such as the  orange, lemons, limes, grapefruit, pineapples, citrons and others are unusually handsome. i  The Florida exhibit was awarded first  prize yesterday of the fruit exhibits  from places outside of Michigan  The attendance at the fair yesterday  was   38,600." i  The list of fruits sent in the exhibit  included avocadoes, Mexican pears,  scarelt plums, paw paws, egg fruit,  grape fruit, shaddoc, kumquats, mangoes, cocoanuts, bananas, Tahiti apples, Otaheite gooseberries, sour sops,  sugar apples, limes, Tahite limes, rough  lemons, common lemons, tamarinds,  star apples, candle nuts, figs, guavas,  sapodillas, pineapples, spondin plums,  citrons, tangerine limes, persimmons,  cerissa, pomegranites, dates, almonds,  maumee apples, swamp apples, sea  grapes, seven year apples, cocoa plums,  cumpti, oranges, ceriman and tijoa.  IS. FLORENCE P. HADEN  WILL LOOK AFTER EXHIBITS  Any  Person   Desiring   to  Send Exhibits May do  so on Saturday  Fruits and Other Agricultural Products of Florida will Have a Good  Display at the Michigan State  Fair—Exhibits to be Sent May  be Left at the Metropolis Office^  Tatum & Co. or Miami Grocery  ■      From  Thursday's Dally  The tropical fruits and plants indigenous to Dade county are to be  very elaborately displayed at the  Michigan state fair, to be held at  Detroit from September 3d to 8th,  inclusive, and it will be an exhibit  of untold value 15 the county.  While the exhibit is intended to  advertise Dade county, it will nevertheless also serve as a state exhibit, as it will be the only display  from Florida, and also because  many of the fruits, etc., to be  shown grow in other parts of the  state.  The idea for the exhibit originated with Mrs. Florence P. Haden of  Cocoanut Grove, and ishe will be  personally in charge of the exhibit  at Detroit, explaning and giving to  the public all the information at her  command relative to the resources  of Dade ounty. Mrs. Haden is now  in Missouri, but will go to Detroit  in time to receive the first consignment of the exhibit, and arrange it  in an attractive space, which has  been set aside by the fair management for the same.  Mr. J. C. Baile and other citizens  have interested themslves with Mrs.  Haden in the matter of securing an  exhibit of fruits, etc., xmd while  they have already assembled a splendid display of practically e\ery  fruit grown in and indigenous to the  county, there may be certan specimens that can be improved upon,  and to that end they request that  any person having unusually fine  fruit of any variety send or bring  the same to the Metropolis office, the  Miami Grocery Store, or office of J.  H.. Tatum & Co.  The first shipment will be- made  Saturday, and the second on Monday of next week, and those desiring to contribute to the exhibit  should have the same at either of  the above, mentioned places in order  to he received early on these dates.  It is a well known fact that the  people of Michigan, Ohio, Indiana  and Illinois are greatly interested in  Florida and 1)ade county, the fact  being evidenced by the large number  of settlers now here, and tourists  who come to Florida every winter  from those states. On this account  the Dade county exhibit will be of  untold value to the county and section, and the move is one that  should receive the most liberal assistance,  in case of illness.  Seiforita Margarita Valle's dancing  class is well attended, and the lit£  lady is proving herself equal to  task  she   has   undertaken.  The ladies of Cocoanut Grove, especially the members of the Housekeepers' Club, wish to express their  appreciation of those Miami mer  chants who have refrained from roadway and tree advertising. |	83642972 Bytes	4776	5836	2720945459	RGB	8	600	asm04000001500008001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1912	1912	1913.jp2	/asm0400/image/1913.jp2

USINESS MEETING OF  THE HOUSEKEEPERS CLUB  M  Cocoanut Grove, Nov. 7—-The first  meeting  of  the   Housekeepers   Club,  on Thursday,  November  5, was on©  of the most interesting that the club  1 has  had.  The club house never loked more?  ^attractive,  in  its dress of green for  table   covers,   screens;   cushions   and  stage settings are all of a soft dark  'green,  that  makes  a  most  effective  * back ground for the club colors, gold  and   white.     The   secretary's   report  for   the   summer's   work   was   most  gratifying   and   the     treasurer's   an-  nouncement  that  the     club   had  no  debts and had a comfortable sum in  the bank was received with delight.  There   was  special   mention  made  of   friends   and     members   who   had  helped put the club in order, and of  Mrs.  Florence  P. Haden,  one of the  club's   most   loyal   members     whose  work at the Michigan state fair during  the   summer  in  behalf  of  Dade  County  is   sure  of  good   results.  The club at large is interested in  the conditions of the village and has  started a movement to secure a fund  from the residents to keep the Main  street free from trash, the club to  j see to the  work.  The Bird Protective Committee,  j Mrs. Montgomery, chairman, promi-  j ses an interesting day in December  [ on the work.  The chairman of education, Mrs.  Grace H. Manlove, reported great  success to the work. She has succeeded in arousing an interest in  the school never before taken. The  school is planning an entertainment  later on that will be a pleasure to  all.  Mrs.  Ralph M.  Munroe,  chairman  of the Domestic Science Committee's  report,   including  a  thoroughly  well  written and up to date paper on the  work   of   the   club   along   that   line,  which was sent to chairman of general  federation  committee.     All  responses  to  roll call this season will  I be on hause hold subjects, and it is  ' possible  that  the  club   will  issue  a  ! second  leaflet  on  "Hints  concerning  | the  cooking  of     Tropical  food"  arranged-by the best house keepers in  the  club.  The club also voted to stand by  all Florida, especially Cocoanut  Grove, industries and home made articles. The watch word to tje "Made  in Florida."  The club has also joined the Dade  County Fair Association and will do  all it can to help on the work.  Absent and sick members were  lovingly   remembered.  A children's Christmas party was  r planned for the afternoon, before  Christmas day, Christmas eve and i  afternoon. Many other details were  attended to and then [plans were  made for entertaining the Women's  Club of Miami, on Thursday, the  12th, at the Housekeepers Club first  social of the season. The Housekeepers hope there will be a large  delegation from theij* sister club.  Gentlemen will also be most welcome.  The club exhibit of club books,  photographs of club houses, programs and souveniers that were collected for the Biennial at Boston in  June last, will be on exhibition at  the club before being taken to the  federation meeting at Live Oak on  the 17th and this will be the only  opportunity that the Miami and Cocoanut Grove clubs will have of seeing it.  To all friends of the club and of  Cocoanut Grove the Housekeepers  Club   extends  a  he/irty welcome.	85555808 Bytes	4825	5909	219843035	RGB	8	600	asm04000001500009001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1913	1913	1914.jp2	/asm0400/image/1914.jp2

This display included a souvenir,  such as the club year book, photograph of club house, club history,  or some word of greeting from every club in the state, with the exception of one. Mrs. Kirk Munroe,  who collected the exhibit, and forwarded it to Boston, told of the  interest it created, and the prominent place it had in the large e*-  fciflit.  After the arrival of all the guests  and when they were comfortably  seated in the main hall of the club  building, the meeting was called to  order by Mrs. Kirk Munroe, president of the Housekeepers' Club and  State Secretary to the General Fed-  eratlf#T, who. in her own happy man  ner, spoke a cordial word of greeting to pie guests of her club, and  introd^ed Mrs. S. V. R. Carpenter,  secretary of the Florida Federation,  who gave a beautiful talk on the  work the Florida clubs are doing,  dwelling long on what it is possible  for them to do, in the line of compulsory education, abolishing child  labor, encouraging manual training  for the  young,  etc.  By special request, Miss Daisy  Carpenter gave one of her excellent  humorous reading0 ~nl being heartily encored, good i ituredly respond  ed with another.  The club rooms were unusually  attractive yesterday afternoon, with  the color scheme of green and yellow carried out in all the decorations. The rugs, table covers an  stage fittings are of a soft mo;  g reen color, and great bowls of  alamanda blossoms, and heavy  clusters of the yellow elder, filled  the   room   with   a   golden   glow.  The hostesses served tea and  .tioffee, with cake of many kinds,  delicious home made cakes, made  b*r the members of the Housekeepers Club. And over the tea cups  there was a busy buzz of conversation.  And warmly were the hotfseKeep-  ers of the Grove praised for their  skill at cake making. There were  also bonbon dishes placed here and  there on the tables filled with delicious  home  hade  cream  candy.  After refreshments, a treat was  given every one, in the dancing of  Senorita Margarita Valle, a graceful young girl from Porto Rica, who  is temporarily making her home at  the Grove. Senorita Valle's movements were rythmical indeed, and  at the conclusion of her dance, she  was   heartily  applauded.  Noted among the members of the  Housekeepers Club yesterday was  the oldest member, Madam Peacock  and the youngest, little Miss Doris  DeGarmo. All in all, there were in  the club room, hostesses and guests  some where between seventy-Jive  and a hundred women, a great gath  ering,   and a  happy one.  The Miami club women expressed  their appreciation of the afternoon  of rare pleasure given them, and  brought home with them some of  the sunshine imparted to them in  the cordial greeting accorded them  by the members of the Housekeepers   Club   of   Cocoanut   GroVe.	83189308 Bytes	4760	5824	4128965389	RGB	8	600	asm04000001500012001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1916	1916	1917.jp2	/asm0400/image/1917.jp2

The Housekeepers Club Discuss  Birds, and The Audubon Work  Mrs. James Montgomery read an Instructive Paper  On this Subject Which Received Just Applause.—  Other Important Subjects on the Program  COCOANUT GROVE,. Dec. .5.—  One of the most interesting sessions  that the Housekeepers Club has had,  was held on Thursday, December  3, when a most up to date paper on  Birds, and the Audubon work, was  read by Mrs. James Montgomery,  one of the club's earnest workers.  Many interesting points were made  and the statement that the Audubon  Society had succeeded in getting  the wholesale milliners of New York  and Chicago, not to sell native or im  ported song birds, for a period of  three years brought forth hearty  applause and Mrs. Montgomery's  plea to women to plead for the birds  upon every occasion was very good,  The paper received just applause and  started a discussion that proved of  great interest.  Before the day paper was read a  short business session was held, at  which it was voted that a letter of  welcome should be sent to the newly  elected president of the Florida Federation of Womens Clubs, Mrs. T.  M.    Shackleford.  The month's program was discussed and a delightful invitation from  the Woman's Club of Mian&gt;i to be  their guests on January 4th was received and accepted by the members  with pleasure.  The club house has had a beautiful gift from one of its members of  new shades for the windows, and a  handsome table cover, Mrs % E. B.  Mallon   being   the   donor.  Mrs. Walter Waldin has alafe given the club some beautiful potted  plants, that are very decorative.  After the business and papers of  the afternoon the ladies and their  friends enjoyed a cup of tea, and  cake and fruit about.the club's tea  table, and were entertained by Miss  McFarlane, who told of her trip to  Boston last June, and attendance at  the General Federation Biennial meet  ing, which she attended as a delegate   from   the   Housekeepers   club.  Mrs. Blanch E. Wise will read a  paper on Oberamagau and the Passion Play, and a great treat is in  store for the ladies.  The founder of the club, Miss Fora  McFarlane was present at the meeting and received, a hearty welcome.  She certainly ought to be pleased  with the club, and the good work  it  is  doing.  The 17th is Civil Service Day In  charge of  Mrs.   Florence  P.   Haden.  The 2 4th is the Clubs Christmas  party to the children of Cqcoanut  Grove..

Mrs. Wise has a most charming  personality and her reading was per  feet. For over an hour she held  the large gathering of ladies and  gentlemen spell-bound by the fascinating manner in which she described the little village of Ober-  amergau and the great drama that is  enacted there every ten years, giving  as no printed paper has ever done  the details of the life of men and  women who take part in the play,  and the reason for the play. There  were few dry eyes in the audience  after the yerr graphic description  of the Crucifiction.  It is needless to say that Mrs. '  Wise received ah ovation when* her .  paper was finished and that every |  one present felt the influence of that  wonderful story. The club is proud j  of Mrs. Wise as a member and the j  club members were most sincerely l  thanked by their guests for the privilege of enjoying the afternoon's en- j  tertainment.  After the lecture delicious tea and  cake   were   served   and   the   guests  were given an opportunity of meet- j  ing  Mrs.   Wise.  There iwere several among the I  audience who had never seen the  play, but the majority had only read  of it ,but one and all felt grateful  to the little lady for her beautifully  worded description of the play and  the little village it is created in.  As Mrs. Wise's knowledge was  from personal experience it was all  the more valuable. !  The  auto  stage   brought  the M-  ami   guests   and     Cocoanut     Grove  turned   out   in   full   force   to   enjoy j  the  afternoon.    If the club did no- i  thing else for the Grove it would be j  dolus: a srood work in providing de-!  lightful literary afternoons to which i  tbe   club   generously   welcomes     all  who ca,re to come.

It began with the Christmas party  given by the Housekeepers Club for  the children of the grove and their  friends and the club has every reason to be proud of the efforts made  to please and the pleasure given.  Over a hundred children and "grown  ups" gathered at the club house on  Thursday afternoon and the party  was formally opened at two o'clock  by the little ones marching in to  the hall, when the club's Christmas  horn sounded and it was a sight to  be long remembered, so many  pretty litle girls and brght ,boys.  The girls beautifully dressed &ud all  so happy and Well mannered. The  Rev. James Bolton, being introduced by the president of the club, gave  the address of welcome, followed  by a hearty Christmas greeting from  Miss McFarlane. Then followed  an hour's play of merry games. During the afternoon Master Earl Waldin recited a Christmas poem and  Madam Peacock told of the first  Christmas tree in Cocoanut Grove  given by her and Mrs. Thomas Hine  twenty-two years ago.  Then ' came the distributions of  gifts and candy bags. The gifts  were arranged on the club's big center table. As each child received  its gift, it passed to the sugar plum  tree, where a gay little bag of candy was presented.  The older people enjoyed a cup of  tea and slice of cake and the little  ones had all the cake and candy  they  wanted.  There were four people present  who had been at Cocoanut Grove's  first Christmas tree, Madam Peacock, Mrs. John Pent, Mrs. Jo.  Frow, and Mrs. C. J. Peacock.  Mrs. Montgomery and Miss Ingrain  played the piano for the children's  games and  to dance by.

The meeting was  called to order by the president who  after a greeting to the members  and guests, introduced Mrs. Grace  H. Manlove, who presided during  the reading of the Five Minute papers, on the Geography of ^ South  America. These papers were the  first of the series of papers on that  country, that the club will give this  season.  The next paper will be on the  Early Conquests and Explorations  and will be given by Mrs. John  Gifford,  on January  14th.  Thursday's papers yere extremely  interesting, especially Mrs. E . B .  Williams, who made many discoveries  for |pu  Mrs. Manlove's papers were entirely up to date, clearly expressed,  and most interesting. Mrs. Haden  always does her work thoroughly and  is  never disappointing.  Miss Flora McFarlain told the club  more in five minutes about the Panama Canal than it seems possible.  Miss McFarlain sent to Washington  for direct information, and then  cleverly culled the main facts for the  paper. There were ten papers and  all of them interesting. The whole  series will be taken care of, and put  into a club scrap book for those to  read who have not been fortunate  enough   to   hear  them.  After the program of the afternoon, the members and guests joined  in singing Auld-Lang-Syne, and then  adjourned to the tea table, where  a happy hour ended a happy afternoon ..  The next meeting of the club will  be on January 7th. It is a business  meeting and one of much importance. Every member is asked to be  present. Meeting called at half past  two  o'clock promptly.

There was  a short musical program that was very delightful.    Miss  Tanner,  a  guest  of  Mrs.  Rodman Smith, gave a beautiful piano  solo  first,   which  was   followed  by   Miss   Dora   Dearborn   with     her  I violin,    Miss     Terril    accompanying  I her   on     the   piano.    Miss     Geiger  came next with a very brilliant and  cleverly   executed   piano   solo,     and  then   followed   several   violin   solos,  by Miss Townsand,  accompanied by  Mrs.   Ralph   Munroe,   on  the   piano.  Miss Dearborn is a pupil of the Miami Conservatory of Music and certainly is a credit to that institution.  Miss   Dearborn's   sweet    personality  won the  admiration  of ^^ery    one.  Mrs. Townsand is spending the season at Camp Biscayne, and has added  a  great deal to the success  of  the   season   here   at   the   Grove,   by  her  ever  readiness  to  do  what  she  can   to   give   pleasure   and   her   unfailing cheerfulness.  As usual, the club was complimented on the delicious and abundant supply of home made cakes, and  good tea served to the guests. There  was a full house, and yet there were  manw bases of cage sent home to  the "men," as little reminders that  they were not forgotten.  There was a "sewing bee" at the  President's home on Monday getting ready for the Club's Tea Fair,  which will be held on the 2 5th in  the afternoon at the club house. Will  the friends of the club remember  and come to it please and bring  friends.  Mrs. Alice Bush has her sister,  Mrs. Kilburn, visiting her. Mrs.  Kilburn was a guest of the club on  Thursday, and expressed herself as  greatly pleased. She also is a club  woman, and is especially interested  in the Housekeepers Club study for  the year, as her club in Vermont is  also   studying   South   America.	83936088 Bytes	4816	5808	2678218362	RGB	8	600	asm04000001500036001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1940	1940	1941.jp2	/asm0400/image/1941.jp2

Grace H. Manlove, President  of the Housekeeper's Club, Plann  li ed the Entertainment and Carried  lit Through to the Pleasure of alL  II  1 Cocoanut Grove, Mar. 31—The day  |{ the Housekeepers Ciub season was  ^rtain'y the reception and program  Jven last Thursday for the Cocoa-  flut Grove school teachers, and  khool children.  '! The chairman of the educational  liommittee Mrs. Graee H. Manlove,  Jnd the President of the club planned the day early in the season. The  children's parents and friends were  invited and every one interested,  and a large number accepted the club  invitation. At 3 o'clock exactly, the  school children marched into the  C'ub room, lead by their teachers  and after all were seated and the  gathering called to order, Miss May-  olini, principal of the school read a  capital paper on the need Of compulsory education, then followed  an essay on the same subject by  Eunice Peacock, that did her and  her teacher great credit. This was  followed by a ishort and to the point  paper on the same subject by Master  | Langdon Carney, which ended with  some suggestions as to improving  he School Jbtouse and grounds.  Master iHoyde Coats came next with  a well written letter to the Club,and  a strong plea for compulsory education, but saying that in h s case  there really was no need for a compulsory education law, as his fathers  little switch was all the law he needed. Miss Mayolini then gave the  Club a list of the things that the  school house and grounds needed  to have attended to, having been  asked to do so, and thanked the  Club for what it had done, and for  the interest the members had shown  this past season, and proving that  the school had improved in every  way  this season.  The report of the Club's chairman  of the Education Committee was  then read.  REPORT  The House Keepers Club this year  decided to take up the subject of  education, especially as connected  with the Cocoanut Grove School, as  part of their work. The chairman  of tjie committee visited most of the  mothers of the attending pupils, and  as near as possible, set a day Cor  them to visit the schools, so all  would not go in one week. This is  something that had not been done  before. The chairman met with  hearty co-operation, then interested  outsiders, those of the Housekeepers Club especially were asked to  visit the school, which they did, and  reported that satisfactory work was  being  done.  The Club had the grounds around  the' school cleared up, and a trash  barrel placed there, the road also  fixed, rocks broken and taken out,  making a smooth path to the building which was before very unsatisfactory. The result is the pupils  are keeping the grounds dean.  Arbor Day was observed, a tree  planted both for Mr. Hall and Dr.  Farris, and well attended by the pupils.  The average attendance has been  very good and there have been nineteen visits by patrons and nineteen  visits  by  interested     parties,     who  have added after their names in the  Visitors Book, such remarks as:  "Order and worfc  excellent"  "Every thing satisfactory"  "Very much pleased"  "Both   teachers   and   pupils   have  done   good  work  and  deserve  great  credit."  This   report  was     received    with  great enthusiasm.  Then    the    President    introduced  Prof.  Mather, who gave a  fine talk  ion  the   present school  methods,  especially that of the High  School.  It  j is a pity that more of the educators  i.of  our  state  could  not   have  heard  [this talk,  for there were very many  j most   excellent   suggestions   for   the  work,   and   Prof.     Mather     declares  that changes are bound to be made  in  the  near future,   as  parents   and  instructors   realize   more   fully   the  I ineeds of individuals.    This talk was  listened   to   with   great   interest  and  set  many   wondering  if   the  present  High  School methods of study were  really what their boy or girl should  have to make the most of tie life  work they will enter, or would have  to  enter.  At the end of Prof. Mather'ts* discourse the President announced that  Miss Hatty Carpenter of the Miami  High School, who now owns and  edits a school paper, "The School  Exponent", requests all parents or  people interested to write her their  ideas on what they think wrong in  school work, no matter what it is.  Names need not be published, but  she feels that in this way she will  get at many things.  Then the children and guests of  the Club were most delightfully entertained by Mr. Patterson who  read several of Uncle Remus' stories, in the most delightful manner,  after which every one sang  "America", and then tea and cake  was served, with candy added for the  children, and every one voted it one  of the most thoroughly enjoyable  days  of the season.	84806508 Bytes	4840	5839	3533530478	RGB	8	600	asm04000001500045001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1949	1949	1950.jp2	/asm0400/image/1950.jp2

Miss McFarlane led a discussion on New Housekeeping, which  proved most interesting in every way  It was finally decided after a-list of  the new devices now in use for house  keeping, that the present up-to-date  housekeeper would hav^ to be a  i trained machinist to be able to use,  j*n^   y--y   y  | dish-washer,    dijfst   cleaners,  I cookers,   darning   machiiigj   and   so  ! on, that are now in use in many of  I the city homes.

"A Wonderfully Prolific Field."  After some weeks' sojourn in the city and  travelling in the North West District, looking  through scientific spectacles all the while, Mr.  C. William Beebe, Curator of Birds at the  New York Zoological Park, has returned to  New York. An enthusiastic naturalist, with a  glowing passion for ornithology, he is carrying  away most favourable impressions of the  country.  An Excellent Collection of Live Birds.  The other evening, in the course of a brief  chat, he told a " Daily Argosy '; man how much  he was interested in what he described as "this  most remarkably interesting field to the  naturalist." He has been all bis time engaged  in scientific work. Every year he goes on  vacation, combining pleasure with business,  and doing all he can for his society—the New  York Zoological Society whose institutions  have already begun to compare favourably with  the great State institutions of Great Britain,  France, Germany and Belgium. On this occasion, he has had the assistance of Mr. Crandall,  a college fellow of New York, and he will  probably be his assistant right along. Mr.  Crandall during his stay here has devoted  himself to the collection of live birds, most of  which have been caught in the Botanic  | Gardens and vicinity. His collection, consisting of three hundred birds, is considered an  excellent one. The birds, though uot new to  science, are new to the New York Zoological  Park which will now have a collection of 3,000  birds—the largest number in the world. Mr.  Beebe has also secured numbers of snakes,  turtles, lizards, 'possums (yawarries), &c.  Agreeably Surprised.  " What most impressed me about this  place," remarked the New York curator, " was  the remarkable ease in getting around in the  country, living in the bush in the absence of  danger, and the cheapness of travelling. I  saw very few snakes, but that is due to the fact  that many of them are nocturnal. At the same  time, let me say, there are fewer snakes here  than in most countries."  " It is remarkable," continued Mr. Beebe  with a smile, " how people both outside and  inside of the colony speak of the danger to be  met with in the iuterior. The bush was a  horrible place, I was told. You can guess  then how agreeably surprised I was when I  went up aud saw for myself."  Promised the enthusiastic curator : " I am  going to bring a lot of people down here—  scientific men. It is absolutely an unknown  country. There is going to be a tremendous  amount of scientific work down here."  An Erroneous Idea.  Mr. Beebe here lugged in a compliment for  the British Guiana Museum, remarking that  " it will be of great help to us when we come  down here as a body of men to do scientific  work. It will be so easy to identify specimens."  " What kind of men ?" the newspaper man  wanted to know.  " Oh, no, not collectors. Scientific men to  do scientific work. There is a lot of field work  to be done."  This started Mr. Beebe off on an impromptu  lecture regarding the Ecology of birds ; there  was a reference to Evolution ; and the name  of Darwin was called in vain—so far as concerned the man who was in quest of copy.  He managed to understand, however, that it  is quite an erroneous idea to believe that the  plumage of birds has anything to do with  environment, or that brilliantly coloured birds  were most to be found in the tropics. Mr.  Beebe particularly wants to know the meaning  of the colours of birds ; and he is going to  devote deep study to the philosophy of the  question.  Praise for the Colony.  He promises also to give close attention to  the local migration of our birds. " Most  decidedly they do migrate," and he instanced  the case of the negrocop and the wicissi duck.   " Ob, British Gaiana   is   a   remarkably  interesting field for naturalists. It is a  wonderfully prolific field. I have been  through Mexico, a good deal of my own country, have been in Trinidad and Venezuela  which is more or less like British Guiana, but  none of those countries compares with this. It  is a white man's country this, and you know  whom to trust. Your rivers are fine—magnificent. I can see opportunities for investing  money here in all kinds of fields, although I  am a scientific man.  i( I am going to write a book about my trip,"  said Mr. Beebe, as the interview came to a  close.

KIRK MONROE  A Pioneer is a title that any man  or woman is proud of, for it at once  places a person above the ordinary  and marks the individual as having  had interesting experiences. So  the Pioneer is always a hero in whatever company he finds himself, especially in the eyes of the young.  "You came here 25 years ago,"  sard a girl to me tKe other day, "how  did you dare?" Well, it did not take  such a lot of courage, looking back  on it now.  Pioneer life, as we know, is always hardest on a woman, but one  of the wonderful things about it is  a woman's ever willingness to follow  the man of her choice*! Old or young  the wilderness has no terrors for her  like being left behind or having Him  go alone.  I wonder how many women in  Dade county today would have come  here of their own will, or from choice  In many cases the men have come  first and such glorious accounts of  wonderful weather, delicious fruits,  and the ease and freedom of a life  in the wilderness (all true too) has  tempted many a woman, who came  rejoicing so at the joy of her man,  that she has never murmured at her  thousand and one little trials that  beset the pioneer woman's life day  and night causing many a tear and  ^backward glance for the comforts  of a civilized home.  *     «.     »  I "know one woman who wore a  sun bonnet all day both in and out  of the house for the first month she  was at Cocoanut Grovo so that her  husband should not see her crying  Today she is very happy in the home  he gave her as we all are after a  few months of "settling down," but  it is hard for a man to realize what  it means to a woman to give up family, friends, church, doctor, and a  comfortable house and sleep in a  tent, while the first house ia being  built which is usually spoken of as  the future packing ho^se or chick-  on house, when the grove comes into  bearing. They do not realize the  fear the women have at finding out  that the crawling creatures of the  earth are so near to them, or the pain  that comes with the hardening of  soft hands in doing the daily housework of pioneer life. No, and women will seldom let them know. So  the men are not to 'blame-  I know several college girls who  left homes in the north full of enthusiasm and joy fit the prospect of  a life among orange grovee, and who  have bravely met and overcome difficulties that if related faithfully  .would hardly be believed,  &gt;        ■ ja    •■    * ■  In IS?4 the total number of Dade  county votes was thirty; the names  of seventeen of the women of that  time are still remembered, although  only four of the women are stiil here,  Mrs. Martha Peacock, Mrs. Isabella  Peacock, Mrs. Matilda Pent and Mrs.  Euphema Frow. The early work  ot those women did much to c«oise  others to come and too much cannot be said in praise of their bravery  hospitality and the good principles.  of life thev stood and worked for.  One of them told me that once being very ill her husband got a friend  who owned a boat to take her to Key  West where a doctor could be consulted, and that while she was away  the men folk of her family thinking  to save her extra washing on her return carefully folded away all ^he  sheets and pillow cases of the beds,  using only the blankets, and when  she did get home she had not only  the blankets but the bed ticking of j  &lt;both mattress* and pillows to wash.  I asked her what she said to them;  "Oh, nothing, dear me, I was only  too glad to get back and proud to  feel that they had thought of me",  but she added, with a twinkle in her j  eye, "it took me a month to get  things   straight   again." j  The first housekeeper or vjocoa-  nut Grove that we have any record  of was a Mrs. Beasley. Her husband  was the first settler here having  come in 1835- The Beasley cabin  was built of logs and thatched with  palmetto leaves, and the ruins of  the stone chimney may still be found  on the grounds of the Ransom school  while the old parts of the Beasley  starch mill, are on Mr. Kirk Mun-  roe's place. Everyone who came  to the Grove, at that time called  "Ldttle Hunting Ground", of course  stopped at the Beasley. Beasley was  a Connecticut man, therefore he  built a stone fire place for his cabin  and Mrs. Beasley seems to have done  ber cooking inside her cabin contrary to the custom prevailing in the  southern wilderness of cooking outside over a chip fire, and there is a  story told by an old settler, that one  day his father was taking dinner at  the Beasley house, and happening  to glance towards the fire place  where Mrs. Beasley was cooking a  coon for dinner, he saw the  head of a big rattlesnake sticking  through a hole in the stones of the  fireplace watching Mrs. Beasley; and  that reminds me that one day just  after we settled here I found a snake  curled up among my tea cups in  a corner of the dining room closet but  like Mrs. Beaseley's snake he had just  dined on a rat, and was too full to  move, so was easily killed.  The next housekeeper was Mrs.  John Pent, "Aunt Tilley" as every  one calls her. Her home was the  first wooden house at the grove, for  in the early days nearly all the home*  were made of palmetto leaves, thatch  .ed over a frame. She is a grand  daughter-in-law of old Squire i^ent  w$io was Commodore Porter's pilot  off the reef in 1820. Mrs- Pent herself comes of a fine old Charleston  family, and. in spite of many years  ■$ genuine pioneer life, has not lost  the refinement  and  graciousness of  fher birth.       The hospitality of her|  home  is  famous.	85965644 Bytes	4912	5832	2724244117	RGB	8	600	asm04000001500058001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1962	1962	1963.jp2	/asm0400/image/1963.jp2

Cocoanut Grove remembers her as  once having resided there and at the  time the Housekeepers* Club was  started she became a member, often  walking three miles from her home  to attend the club meetings and do  her share of the club work.  *     *    *  The great loneliness of the early  days seems riways to be the thing  remembered by the women; they  longed for other women from the  great outside world. I do not think  anyone ever had differences in those  days and they all seemed to have  been good cooks, and when one remembers that mosit of that work was  done out of doors over wood fires  it is interesting to hear of the dinners these pioneer women prepared  for families and guests. There are  wonderful stories of Jonny cake,  "sweet and plenty of it," stewed venison, ash baked sweet potatoes, boiled Seminole squash, corn pones,  roast wild hog, and wild turkey,  coontie pudding, and coontie pancake  Indin Sofkie, Gypsie Stew, Reef  Bean soup, turtle fry, and fried chick  en. I can remember having a gift  of six eggs at a Christmas tree that  was considered a precious remembrance.  In fact a study of the cooking in  those days is an extremely interesting thing. There was very little  cultivated fruit, if any,„ beyond  guavas, limes, sapodillas and pomegranates but the pioneer women of  that time made* use of all the wild  I fruits and found them good. The  Hog plum, the cocoa plum, huckel-  berries, sea grape, wild grape, custard apple, paw paw, ground gooseberry, and Indian possomon. There  were but 6 orange trees in the whole  county,  and  they were here.  Flour, sugar, coffee, salt and grits  were all brought from Key West, or  obtained at times from the one  store, Mr. Brickel's south of Jupiter  Inlet.  The first winter we were here two  of my women friends asked me to  let them have a can of condensed  milk fcs their children had never  seen milk. One of the women had  been born and brought up on the  West Coast in the cattle country, so  of course, she knew what it was, but  herf cJsWren k«d ■  The other haci cui - here when young  and could not remember ever having  tasted milk, although she was certain her father had owned three  cowst Cuava syrup was the principal sweetening for pies and cakes,  and it is good.  I fancy reading was mostly from  newspapers, although I can tell of  one pioneer woman's husband who  had, and read many of the standard  books, which he obtained from wreck  ed vessels. A wreck was the most  wished for and thoroughly enjoyed  thing that could happen, provided no  lives were lost, and that seldom oe-  cured. The men all went to the  wreck when ever "Providence, bad  machinery and worse navigation  sent us one," and then it was that  the women had a good holiday in as  much as they all got together for  company, while the men were "off  wrecking."  If the wreck was a general cargo,  such as canned foods, dry gOodsj,  household furniture, and baby carriages then there* was great rejoicing, Of course that was long ago 1  before the Revenue cutter, an old  side-wheeler at that time could get  here, or the wreck could be reported  at Key West, and as there were no  telegraph lines then, it was always  quite a while before a wrecked vessel could be reported.  I remember only two such wrecks,  and also a wine wreck, when the  beach was strewn with wine. Then  a ship came ashore loaded with olives  stuffed and salted. That cargo was  a great disappointment, as so few of  us cared for olives, especially in such  quantities. But a wreck of ready-  made clothing, sewing machines,  bolts of cloth, kitchen utensils, candles and furniture was something  like, and every body was happy.  *     *     *  It is scarcely as long ago as a  quarter of a century since whenever  any of us wanted anything very much  that it could not be picked up over  on the beach at Cape Florida, or  something that would an; ^ cT as  well. "Beach  combing"     was     a  fascinating occupation, and I have  seen all sorts of odd things found.  One day one of my young friends  wanted a cradle for her first-born (a  strappling young man of 23 now)  and said to her husband, "I wish you  would go over to the Cape and see if  you can't find a cradle."  He did go, and came back with a  cradle. It was a little the worse  for having come from a wreck- and  laid on the beach for a while, but  when it had been painted a French  gray and neatly put together, it proved all it should be  Many a good boat has been picked up and at one time there was not  a house here that did not boast of  at least one piece of ship furniture.  But those were the early days, when  Christmas tree gifts were a bushel of  Irish potatoes, a dozen eg&s, a fancy  cake pan, and when an eggbeater  was unknown. When Sunday school  was attended by every man, woman,  baby and dog in the place, and al-  \\ ways   ended   in   a  social   gathering;  when  every woman    uiu    ner    own  work,   including   her   washing,   and  when a social gathering was one in  every sense of the word.  *     *     »  Way back*  twenty-five years ago,  Cocoanut Grove had but six house?  and  that  number  included the B/  view  nouse, aiwiwaiu  me  ±*e^  Inn, and now the Lake Placid Schoo  quarters. Miami at that time had  but three houses. Mrs. Chnrles Peacock, lovingly known as "Aunt Bella" and whom Mr. Flagler called  the Mother of Cocoanut Grove did  all the work of the Bay, in that she  managed everything.

The   Peacock  Inn  was  the   great  gathering  place  for  all   occasions—  political   meetings,   church   services,  Christmas trees, weddings, and club  meetings,   for  not   only   the   Housekeepers' Club met there, but the Bis-  jcayne Bay Yacht Club held its first  j regatta from the Peacock wharf, and  gave its  first  entertainment,   a  dinner, at the Peacock Inn, then called  J The Bay View House.

She* was    also    the  j first  woman   to   homestead   land   in  ! Dade  county.    The  Cocoanut   Grove^j  railroad station is on her land, and  very near where her little one-room  house stood.    One morning a friend  v took a picture of her standing on the  tiny   piazza   in   front   of   her   house  with a broom in her hand, and surrounded   by   household   articles   of  various kinds.    A few years ago she  happened to go to an illustrated lecture   on   "Life   in   the  Wilderness,"  and then all of a sudden her little  [homestead cabin    with herself    and  i broom appeared on the canvass, entitled, "A Pioneer Home in Florida."  She was here when the firsi:  car- |.  riage   arrived,  Mr.   William  Fuzzaid*''|  who then liyed at Cutler, then called  "The Hunting Grounds" brought  one  to  the  bay  and  cleared  out    a  road between Cutler and the Grove.  There was no road to Miami,  so he  made a passable one between Cutler  and the Grove, so as to use the car*  riage,   to   which   he  harnessed     the  ; only  mule here  at  that time, a big  white   animal   called   Sampson,   who j  was just as much of  a character as j  any of  us.     Well Mr. Fuzzard     ap-  peared  with his carriage and Samp-  son, and we all made a rush  for Xty  and  he let the women and children j  have   a     ride     around     the     hotel  grounds.    Now auto cars go to Cutler from Mami and  back every day.  All of this does not make us as old  as   at   first   appears,   for  civilization  came to the Bay very quickly after  it was discovered by    Mr.    Flagler,  through   a   bunch   of   lime  blossoms  shown to him by Mr. Ingraham who  had  gathered them  on Mrs.  Tuttle's  place,   when   northern   Florida   had  heen frozen, but that's another story.

Being     the     furthest  away delegate to go to the conven  tion, and% also being the first opportunity to attend one as an officer, things naturally made an impression, especially the unceasing  attention and great cordiality of the  residents of Live Oak.  There were but two delegates  from the extreme Southern part of  the State, and we traveled alone to  Jacksonville. There we were joined by the Jacksonville delegates and  also those from San Matleo, Day-  tona, Fairfield, Green Cove Springs,  Palatka, Gainesville and Ormond  and forthwith took possession of the  Pullman going through to Live Oak.  It was after dark when we reached  there, but no one would have  thought it for the city was ablaze  with electric lights, one wire shinning forth the word "welcome". At  the depot we were met by a reception committee, who assigned us to  our respective lodgings for the week  Four of us being entertained at the  new hotel the "Suwannee hotel." a  comfortable up to date house, managed  in  a  most  courteous  manner.  That night the 17th, those of us  who were not too weary attended  the reception given by the Hostess  Club, the Womens Club of Live  Oak, to the officers and club delegates, at the Armory, tendered by  the Live Ook Rifles for that Purpose, and it will be long before that  evening is forgotten by those enjoy-  j ing  it.  The   little     town       certainly   did  everything   in   !it&   power   [to   show  their appreciation of the Feredation.  Every  business  house  on   the  main  street   was   decorated   with   Federation  colors.     Gold  and  Green.    The  hotel     was   finely   decorated.'   Both  banks  not  only honored  us in that  way, but they fitted up a rest room  for   the   iljadlesi,   where   every   convenience for writing was found, and  most     graciously      the    authorities  granted   the   use   of   the   new   court  house court  room  in  which to  hold  the  Federation's  meetings,  and  certainly there could not have been, a  more comfortable place.     The acoustics  were  so  fine   in   this  hall  that  none of us tired of speaking, and in  fact it was hard work to stop, even  here the gold and green decorations  made  the  room  bright.  L     Wednesday   evening  the   members  | of the convention were not only ten- j  | dered a musical by the Hostess Club, j  | but   the   Live   Oak   Board   of   Trade;  ' came   splendidly   to   the   front   with |  \ a  reception  at  the  Suwannee  hotel, j  that   was   most   thoroughly   enjoyed |  j; and so  complimentary to the ladies (  j that even the ice creams were serv- j  ed   in   federation   colors,     and     the |  cakes iced in the same way bearing j  the   initials,   F.    F.    W.    C.     It   is j  safe   to   say   that   there   was   not   a j  club woman in Like Oak that night j  that  did  not  have  a  good  word  for ;  the Live Oak men.  On Wednesday evening before  the reception, the convention met  to hear the President's address, Mrs.  T. M. Shackleford, presiding officer in the absence of the president,  Mrs. C. H. Raynor, read Mrs.  Ranyor's address, which was most  enthusiastically     received. Mrs.  Raynor has been a most untiring  worker as president of the federation, and her term of office is marked by many successes. Unavoidably she could not be present and so  the First Vice President, Mrs.  Shackleford, of Tallahassee, presided. Mrs. Shackleford is now president of the federation and completely won the hearts of the members  fortunate enough to be at the convention.	86539328 Bytes	4979	5792	2065167361	RGB	8	600	asm04000001500062001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1966	1966	1967.jp2	/asm0400/image/1967.jp2

The    announcement    of     election  returns   were   waited   for   most  anxiously as there were many favorites  on   the   ticket,     and   greeted     with  great applause especially by he East  Coast   delegates,,   who   scarcely   ex-  | pected to be on the ticket this &gt;~ear,  but  the   East  Coast  won  first  vice-  ' president iri Mrs. John S. 'Frederick,  | president of the Womans Club of Mi-  i ami,  and also  a prominent  member  j of the Housekeepers Club of Jfecoa-  nut Grove.  The ladies of Live Oak we^ not  content in entertaining their Quests  at public functions, but every delegate was cordially invited ou£ to  dinners and teas between .sessions,  so that we carried away with us,  not only the sense of public entertainment, but the memory of the delightful  homes  of Live  Oak.  And I must not forget the R. R.  Company wlio offered the use of  their cars to the ladies for a trip to  a lovely Park where luncheons were  to be served, but which many of us  had to refuse on account of work, for  at this convention, business was  strictly attended to, and the invitation came just at the most exciting  time "of my life" as I heard one delegate say .when the polls were open for voting, but the ladies thoroughly appreciated the offer, and the  compliment   will   not   be   forgotten.  The most interesting papers and  discussions were upon education,  Audubon work, and Forestry. The  session of education discussion was  honored by the presence of the  Senator of Suwannee county, wno  gave the members just praise for  their earnest work, and promised  help at Tallahassee.  On Thursday Mrs. Florence P.  Kelley, general secretary of the  National Consumer's League of New  York City addressed the convention  and threw light on Child Labor, and  womans work that will make us»  think as never before. Among other things she made this revelation,  "that only four articles in general  use are untouched by children's  hands in the course of manufacture.  Mrs. Kelley said also "a plea of  ignorance for intelligent women regarding actual working conditions  is a mistake, certainly no excuse."  Another^ earnest speaker was Dr.  Eleanor vEtevens, of Jacksonville,  chairman of the Federation Health  department. She spoke almost entirely on Tuberculosis as it effects  Florida, and besides telling much,  she arranged a most interesting exhibit partaining to the work.  \       1  On Friday evening the convention  was most seriously talked to by  Enos Mills, of the U. S. Forest service, on Forestry, who sent us away  feeling that we lost a friend every  time a tree was cut down.  Nor must I forget a delightful  little visit some of us made to the  newly erected Episcopal church.  The rector was there to receive us  and before we left, the Doxology  was sung and the Benediction pronounced. And all this generous  hospitality did not leave with the  last session of the convention, but  was kept up until the last delegate  was seated in the car that took us  away from Live Oak.  Certainly the Fourteenth Convention of the Florida Federation was  a most successful one.  There were two invitations to entertain  the  convention  next .November;   one   from   De   Funiak   Springs,  and   the   other   from   Palatka.    The  latter   place   wae   chosen   as   being  most  central   for  all  the  State  and  the   ladies   of   the   Woman's   Fort-  j nightly Club of Palatka, are sure to  | fre)   equal   to   »the   occasion.        The?  Fortnightly Club is one of the most  progressive clubs in the Federation.  If the Federation does nothing else  it   makes   us  neighbors   and   creates  [a   personal   interest   in   each   other,  not  only  as  a  club,  but as  individuals.  The founder of the Florida Federation, Mrs. E. G. G. Munsell, of  Green Cove Springs was present and  received a royal welcome. Also  Mrs. N. C. Wamboldt of Fairfield,  one of the charter members. These  ;two have attended every meeting  of the federation since the first was  called in 18 9 5. Mrs. Munsell having had the honor and pleasure or  being chairman of the committee on  Resolutions of Thanks at nearly every meeting. 11 is also interesting  to remember that Mrs. C % B. Far-  rell, of Live Oak, was the only  name on the ticket that received a  unanimous vote, she being elected  Recording  Secretary.  MRS.   KIRK   MliNROE,  President   Housekeepers   Club.

The country has such a varied climate that many things grow  there that we do not have here.       On the Isthmus of Panama the  Great Iguana Liszard is much esteemed f^r  food*   It is said  to taste like ; j ng chicken.  The Armadillo is also eaten and  the description reminded :nf of the gopher, found here*  Th       Off the Pacific Coast of South America, en  the Gallapagos Islands, enormous turtles that roar and hallow.  On the banks of th€ Amazon River tht natives make an oil from  turtle eggs which they use for cooking re.'7 lighting.   The  mode of preparing this oil, as described by the traveller,  Henry ¥. Bates, is interesting.   They dig the eggB out of  the sand by the thousand and pile them until they haye what  they want, then they carry them to their canoes and pitch  them in.   They then break the shells and mash them up.  The young Indians sometimes take off their clothes and get in  with their feet to break them up,   They then pour in water  and stir them well, and leave them in the sun till an oil  rises tc the top, which is skimmed off.   It is then refined  and put away for use.  Challona is dried mutton.   The sheep is split open  when killed, frozen, and when stiff It is sprinkled with water  and. frozen again.

It must be  cut up in small bits, boiled a long time before it is tender.  Clurno is frozen white potatoes that are dried  while frozen.  They will keep a year and the Peruvians prize  them for food, but some travellers do not like them.  The high plateau of Peru is said to be the home of  the white potato and of good things to eat.  There string  beans grow as long as your arm.  The paj&gt;as Amarillas or  yellow potato of Peru is said to be delicious.  There are a  great many varieties of sweet potatoes there too.  Here also  is found the Yucca, corn, melons, oranges, lemons, alligator  pears, guavas, pomegranates, pineapples, bananas, peaches,  pears and grapes ofmany varieties.  There are excellent fish.  One kind is dressed with lemon juice and eaten raw.  There  are many kinds of meat to be had- a kid or guinea pig costs  a mere trifle there.  The latter tastes like young pigeon.  Quina is the name of the grain grown on the high lands of  Peru.   It looks like our dock weed.  Has yellow or red  leaves.  When the seeds are shelled out they are white and  look like fine hominy*  They cook it in mushes and also use  it to thicken stews.  The lima bean is a natiye of Peru.  The Cornaraba Palm of Brazil has an edible vegatable  crown and its leaves are coated with a vegetable wax from  which candles are made.  The Cashew nut is a native of Brazil.

In our day and generation, as a result of Pan-American  Congresses and international exchange of courtesies, we are  all rapidly becoming acquainted with the social, political  and industrial conditions of the South American countries.  It would seem that the process of civilization ( that  great unifier which has us all in its grip), delayed in South  America for centuries, is now going on by leaps and bounds,  it so that our twin sister of the south may soon claim to be  as up-to-date and as well equipped for the business of the  future as any other division of the earth.  In other words, South America, discovered in the 15th  century, is in reality only coming into her own at the opening of the 2Oth.  It would be interesting to study the causes of her somewhat tardy development and our own priority, but my  subject  /ill not admit of such a speculative excursion.  I am to tell  about the early conquests and explorations.  Before reverting, however, to those stirring and bloodcurdling days, I propose to lead you gently backwards in time,  and give a cursory sketch of two discoverers and explorers of  a thoroly modern type, both of them epoch making in the impetus which their writings gave.  I refer to Alexander von Humboldt and Charles Darwin.  i     It seemed to me an instructive method to briefly review  i the work of these two great observers who were so intent upon  f seeing things as they actually exist, whereas the early explorers were intent upon finding rather what existed in their  * own minds than the actual facts.    5?hey seem strangely to  link us to the past in spite of their modern point of view.  Humboldt, especially, dispelled illusions and settled many a  mooted point.  Before Humboldt's voyage everything beyond the fringe of  ■/ coast was still more or less terra incognita fat least to the  world in general), while after his patient toil and exhaustive  writings, fables gave way to scientific conclusions and the  great modern era was fully ushered in.  "Charles Darwin stands out as the most ideal seeker after  truth, patient, tireless, teachable."	86528716 Bytes	4908	5875	3591841819	RGB	8	600	asm04000001500087001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1991	1991	1992.jp2	/asm0400/image/1992.jp2

It was a 5  year voyage, its purpose being chiefly to survey the coast  line.    The date of sailing was 1831.  After reaching Brazil the "Beagle" sailed south. Darwin  made frequent and prolonged trips ashore, spending in all, 2  years of research north and south of the mouth of the Plata  River.   Passing thro the Straits of Magellan they took aboard  some native Fuegians who went all the way to England. This  seems, by the way, to have been a popular custom in all ages,  from Magellan to Peary.  They sailed up the West Coast as far as Peru, always exploring inland, then across the Pacific, returning via Australia and Cape of Good Hope, a circling of the globe not far  different from that of Drake and Magellan (as we shall see),  except always in the character of the spoils and the style  of the log book.  Noting some of Darwin1s impressions and conclusions -  first of all, the intense and vivid tropic luxuriance of the  Brazilian forests captivated him, and his delight in these  first impressions he never tired of recalling.  In all his inland excursions there was surprise at finding such crude and backward conditions, no knowledge of the  compass, or of geography.    Even matches were unknown and  habits of ablution likewise (the latter especiallydispleasing  to an Englishman!)  The boundless and monotomous plains of Patagonia with  wandering tribes of f,horse Indians" gave place, as they reached  the Straits, to those wierd serai-submerged mountain ranges,  covered with forests, peat and humus, of Tierra del Puego, and  to shell-fish-eating, roving, naked natives of  the lowest, most  abject type.     On the west coast earthquake studies and a  very thorough analysis of the marked differences in vegetation  and civilization generally caused by the great Andes barrier,  occupied more leisure months.  Darwin says he grows tired of repeating the epithets  "barren" and "sterile".   He concludes that the vast snow  fields of the Andes will furnish the only future source of reclamation - and that the old Inca civilization was only made  possible by their use of the snow water for irrigation, earthquakes having probably destroyed traces of their works.  He noted everywhere the strong and liberal hand of Spain  iA olden days by the style of half-finished buildings, and by  way of contrast to the departed glory and promise ofher early  colonies, he finds modern filth and ague along the whole west  coast.	86859912 Bytes	4936	5864	2655908488	RGB	8	600	asm04000001500088001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1992	1992	1993.jp2	/asm0400/image/1993.jp2

Both are temples to his sensitive and religious nature,  and it is characteristic of the man that he should thus sum  up the moral gain of his 5 years' journey:  "Goodhumored patience,  "freedom from selfishness,  "Habit of acting for oneself,  "Make the best of everything."  If Charles Darwin was an ideal seeker after truth, Alexander von Humboldt was none the less so, and he had a far  moie voracious, all comprehending intellect, and a more poetic  imagination, besides combining the indefatigable painstaking  thoroughness so characteristic of the Overman scholar.  Nothing was too small or too great.  It seemed as the  he fell; called upon to sift the Universe, being almost indifferent as to what particular portion of the Universe was assigned \o  him for study.  He observed and noted everything  on sea, m land and above.  His toyage to South America, Cuba and Mexico was in a  measure wholly accidental. To it we owe massive volumes of  fascinating narrative, a very mine of research, so much so  that every traveler since is always quoting it.  His plars had been made for a voyage to Egypt. Frustrated  in this, he tjien planned to visit other parts of Africa. Again  and again disappointed, with hope deferred, at last, while  passing thro Spain, some distinguished friends obtained the  privilege for him to visit South America in the interests of  science.    It was a privilege and not unaccompanied by danger,  for England was still engaged in hampering Spain1s intercourse  with her colonies, and lights on shipboard, for prudence sake,  had to be put out at night, hence Humboldt, who never knew  seasickness, was much distressed at not being able during his  5 years sailing to pursue his studies at night.  His ship was the "Pizarro" and he sailed in 1799, accompanied by Bonplana, a noted French Botanist. Passing the  Azores, Canaries arid Peak of Teneriffe, he began to note at  once how the course of trade winds and of the Gulf Stream  m#st have facilitated the colonists on their outward passage  and made return more difficult.     He noted the unfamiliar  firmament, as well known stars began to sink out of sight,  when they sailed into the west and south.  At last after a  41 day passage they landed at Tobago.  Here he made an interesting comparison; it seemes to him that the ever present  sactus growth on these shores was to the new world what  leather was to the old.	88353404 Bytes	4960	5936	1763025693	RGB	8	600	asm04000001500089001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1993	1993	1994.jp2	/asm0400/image/1994.jp2

In the remote interior of South America, where the determination of river sources and water sheds was wll nigh  impossible, there had been vexatious boundary disputes extending over hundreds of years.    One of the chief objects of  this voyage was the study of this region, in order to settle  claims and altercations.   Up the wide basin of the Orinoco  and over into the tributaries of the still vaster Amazon  basin he travelled, collating and comparing old maps, which  had been made ad libitum by early writers and have invariably located fabulous lakes and golden cities in ever more  remote and inaccessible regions.  As to the marvels of this far famed El Dorado, he compared the highly colored version? of Sir Walter Raleigh (more  anon) with the "tales of monks", noting in playful veing the  fondness for narrative at missions, at sea, and in the East,  wherever in fact, the mind wants amusement.  He studied the effect of Spanish rule and priestly mission on the native Indian character and proved that previous  confusion of names was often due to a mixture of native dialects as one tribe had replaced another, so often the case  in the old oppressive days.  He hadtheories to account for the fables of a tribe of  Amazons, and of the ever wonderful"gilded city".  He even  tried to explain from a scientific standpoint the savage custom of tattooing the body, and cannibalism.  In regard to  cannibalism, he said it was considered an honor to the dead  to eat a portion of the body and a means of acquiring the  virtues of the deceased, and he concludes that as an Eastern  poet has said, "Of all animals man is the most fantastic in  his manners and the most disorderly in his propensities."  He found that the native guide considered every Frenchma  a physician, and every German a miner, and in his case they  were ever urging him on to seek for gold mines, and saw no  sense in his measuring trees and collecting seeds.  The craze for gold giving rise to many variations of  the El Dorado myth, and which has for so long been a ruling  passion, seemed to him an "ignus fatuus" in a land where the  surface needs only scraping to yield abunBant harvests.	86310034 Bytes	4892	5879	2641817351	RGB	8	600	asm04000001500090001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1994	1994	1995.jp2	/asm0400/image/1995.jp2

'  ' ^  His description of the Llanoes is poetic indeed the *  indolence of the native, the lack of water and the mirap-e  giving an illusion of the sea.   ?he awful, sad and glBomy  aspect of these interminable savannahs or etenpes a™^i ed  strongly to his imagination.   The absence of domesticated  animals had precluded that stage of semi-civilization found  in the Orient, thus-the link connecting hunting with apri-  oulture was missing ane he bemoans that the project once  proposed of introducing camels, which would have been such  an immense benefit, failed because opposed b-w the lords of  the Indian villages, who used to let out the"natives as  burden bearers and who naturally desired no competition.  We have in Humboldt's narrative a most exhaustive study  of these Indian villages and of the Indian mind in its naive  conclusions, as, for instances, that the"dew was the spittle  of the stars".  He tells how a native said to him, "Your God  keeps himself shut up in a house, as tho old and infirm. Curs  is in the forest, in the fields, and on the mountains, whence  the rain comesi"  These brief allusions to the scope of Humboldt's researches may give some notion of his colossal work and his all  comprehending intellect.

The two governments  soon became desperate rivals in the new quest, and England  was ere long to be in the game also:  But above all, Spain was ripe for crusade, or conquest and  if both, all the better.     For 800 years she had been waging fanatical warfare against the Moors, and it so happened  that just the year of Columbus1 first voyage (1492) the  Moors had been finally vanquished and driven forth from  Granada, their last stronghold.  When, therefore, the exciting rumor spread of a fresh field for adventure, it was a  welcome rally.      Zeal and daring flared up anew and everything - the old crusading spirit, the rivalry with Portugal,  and the dred of England's interference, but served to fan  SpainTs ardor.  The game was on!  Ho for Cathay and all its name implied,1  Thus every ship that sailed forth and sighted land,  began to nose along the shores, and eager eyes peered into  every bay and river mouth, ever hoping for the passage thro  the land to Cathay.    Barrnn islands and wild natives were  but promising incidents as, filled with the glamor of their  fond illusion, they pressed on to find other islands, and  hope continued to spring eternal, as it has always a way of  doing.  Each voyage threw a little new light on the problem  which confronted the old navigators. They were divided in  their notions, some clinging to the fTwet theory11, which  supposed an all encompassing sea, some favoring the "dry  theory", which supposed a solid mass of land.  Theories  changed from wet to dry, from dry to wet, as the vast expans  of land was gradually revealed, or again as the great gulfs  and bays gave promise of the dream's fulfillment.	87782064 Bytes	4968	5888	687198223	RGB	8	600	asm04000001500092001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1996	1996	1997.jp2	/asm0400/image/1997.jp2

Perhaps  in no other way can we get so vivid a notion of the cha,nges  being wrought by those intrepid sailors.   The study of  these maps in chronological order might be labelled "What  the Spaniards sought and what the Spaniards found!"  I have selected 4 maps, which mark the significant steps  from theory to actual discovery:-  1474 Tosoanelli  1502 Cantino  1514 Leonardo da Vinci  1541 Mercator  Covering a period of 67  years.  1474.    The first is known as the Toscanelli Chart. Tosoa  nelli was a learned Italian geographer, but such a credulous  old soul that everything he had read in Marco Polo was to  him gospel truth.  Columbus applied to Toscanelli for  advice about the route he was planning across the unknown sea  as far back as 1474, and he received in answer not only the  precious chart, but several letters containing most explicit  details and directions.  Columbus was told that it was a very noble and grand  project, that of sailing from east to west, and that he would  find it a voyage to powerful kingdoms and to cities wealthy  and noble, where all the people are merchants dealing in  previous wares.   In one port alone there were, he said, 100  ships of pepper unloading.  "The country is very populous  ~i with cities without number, under one sovereign called the  Grand Khan."  Then he descants upon the wonderful rivers,  with marble bridges, the pearls, jewels and spices to be had,  the learned men, the temples covered with gold, etc., etc.  The islands and distances are all most accurately charted  as you perceive.  i	85969568 Bytes	4872	5880	971936278	RGB	8	600	asm04000001500093001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/1997	1997	1998.jp2	/asm0400/image/1998.jp2

The second map 1 have is one among a number which  attempted to show what was actually found on the various  voyages up to date.    Thus there is seen now a section of  the coast line of South America, the islands now quite well  defined - Cuba, Hispanola and Porto Rico, with the Florida  peninsula, which was presumed to be part of the great mainland  of Asia.  1514.  LEONARDI DA VINCI.  The third map is made b; Leonard! da Vinci, the  great Italian artist, who besides was interested in the science  of navigation, as he was in everything else under heaven.  His map is the earliest known with the name "America"  w£ich replaced v^hat had been shown on previous maps as Terra  Firma, or "The Hew World".    The wet theory here is very  evident, as you see, Florida and Newfoundland as well as  "America" being islands, large and small, all convenient  to the coast of Cathay.  1541.  MBRCATOR.  We now come to Mercator's map, dated 1541. By this  time the great new continents had proudljr asserted themselves -  Cathay or no Cathay, it was certain that there was something  else to be reckoned with - namely a vest, unexplored world  sprung from the sea.       This was the first time that  the name "America" was used to cover the entire western country.  Here were no proud cities and no.marble bridges  spanned the mighty rivers.  On the wholej She conquerors  doubtless felt elated, this great big extent of solid impen*-  etrable "terra firma" was frowned upon as a barrier which had  shattered many a fond illusion.  DATES .  These maps cover a period of 65 years - or about 50  years after Columbus' first voyage.   By reviewing this per  iod and citing the chief discoveries in order, we shall get  fixed in our minds the sequence of events.  1498.    South America was first seen ih 1498 by Columbus  on his third voyage.  He sighted the island of "Trinidad"  (Trinity), thus piously naming it from its 3 mountain peafes.  Passing the mouths of the Orinoco, these vast floods of fresh  water, he concluded, must pour down from the pinnacle of the  globe, where, doubtless was the region of fabled Paradise.  He coasted on and probably landed at where Cumana, the oldest  settlement, was afterwards started.   All around these north  em shores and the Island of Margarita pearls were found, and  henceforth this was to be known as the "Pearl Coast".	87703500 Bytes	4984	5864	2612460233	RGB	8	600	asm04000001500100001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/2004	2004	2005.jp2	/asm0400/image/2005.jp2

And after the first discovery of South America by Col-  umBus, Vespucius, in 1499, explored Brazil, naming it "The Land  of Paroquets", "The Land of the True Cross", and later "Brazil"  from a plentiful dyewood found there, and well known in the East  and thus named 300 years before.  1500. In 1500 one of Vespucius1 companions discovered the  mouth of the Amazon, and the same year Portugal claimed Brazil  as her find.  1515.  In 1515 explorers had crept down the coast and one  Solis, a comrade of Vespucius, discovered the La Plata, which  was hailed as the long sought straight or passage.  He and his  men landing on the shores of this "Mar dulce" or fresh water sea,  were promptly captured, roasted and devoured by ecreaming and  dancing demons.  1513.    In 1513 Balboa crossed the Isthmus and was the first to  see the ocean beyond.  1507.    As early as 1507, colonization had begun in earnest.  The northern coast country, which was then called "Terra Firma",  was divided into east and west districts, and assigned to two  governors and Jamaica was to serve as granary for the two provinces of Golden Castile and New Andalusia.  Colonists and miners were to be brought from Hispaniola.    When they landed  poisoned arrows greeted them, boundary disputes began and there  were the usual ravages and efforts to subdue, and an endless  civil strife, so that not an inch of all this Spanish Main but  had its tale of blood and woe.  The names along this coast remain - thus "Darien" ,  "Venezuela", Pearl Coast""Paria".   These four districts combined were the first to be called "America". "5ferra Firma" or  "America" was the term used to distinguish it from "Brazil"  and also from the islands lying near "America'.  For a long  time when men spoke of America, or the New World, they meant  1  the land mostly south of the Equator, because the northern  coasts were still supposed to be parts of Asia.  1497.    While as a result of all these voyages the new  coasts were rapidly being revealed, something quits strange  and startling had happened in Europe.   One Vasco de Gama,  a Portuguese, as early as 1497, had sailed around cape of  Good Hope and had reached the Indian coast by the Eastern  route, so that when Columbus returned from his third voyage  in 1498, vaguely sensing the grandeur of his vast, strange  discoveries, he heard the news of Vasco de Gama's giroetag	87074344 Bytes	4928	5888	1519040170	RGB	8	600	asm04000001500101001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/2005	2005	2006.jp2	/asm0400/image/2006.jp2

Vasco de Gama's glowing  and definite results were compared with the empty and miserable performance of Columbus, and he was dubbed in cruel derision "Admiral of Mosquito La,nd, the man who discovered a  land of vanity and deceit, the grave, of Spanish gentlemen."  The rivalry between Spain and Portugal thus became  sharper than ever.    Portugal continued to claim that she  had solved the riddle, altho not loth to send her sailors  also westward and have her fingers in this pie also.  1493.    The bitter jealousy between the two navigating  nations was of such long standing, and of such a nature,  that immediately after Columbus' first voyage, Pope Alex  VI in 1493, had seen fit to take matters in his hands and  forestal dissension by dividing up the unclaimed parts of  the earth between these two quarrelsome children.  He drew  a line from north to south. Spain should have all west of  this line and Portugal all east of the line.  A canny old Pope to be sureI  tho little did he dream  of the queer complications that would arise when it was found  that Brazil jutted so far east as to fall east of the line  and thus, coming under Portugal's sway, the oldtime enemies  were brought into close proximity in the new world, instead  of having an ocean to divide them as the Pope had planned.  I will only mention a few more dates.  1519-22.      The greatest event of all was Magellan's voy-  age, discovering the straits and circling the globe.  1540.        It was not until 1540 that South America was  entirely circumnavigated and her true coast line established,  (the time you remember of Mercators map).   From this date  onward the center of interest rather shifts from the coasts  to the great unexplored interior, with its mighty rivers, its  mines and forests.  1570.    And after 1570 when Sir Francis Drake came on the  scene, Spain's long power began to wane.  England's prowess on the seas had grown apace, and with  Drake and his bold companions and followers scouring the  Spanish Main and plucking the Spaniard's feathers one by one,  and Spain herself all engrossed with her latest crusade, that  of stamping out Protestantism in Europe, her colonies in the  new world were left pretty much to fight it out alone.  1595.    In 1595, just about 100 years after the discovery,  Sir Walter Raleigh, with his vast roseate schemes, was still  after the fabled golden city up the Orinoco.  1577.    As late as 1577, the other fixed idea of the century,  the finding of an open passage to Cathay, still found champions.  Way up in Labrador, Frobisher was pushing into the ice and snow  seeking a route to the Spice Islands.   He had brought some  shining ore from this forbidding land, that is said to have  set England wild.  So more men and more ships set forth "finding", to qtiote  the chronicle, "that, alas, instead of odoriferous and fragrant smells of sweete gums and pleasant notes of musicale  birds, they tasted the most boisterous boreal blasts mixt with  snow and hail."  .	86374764 Bytes	4921	5849	1338329650	RGB	8	600	asm04000001500102001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/2006	2006	2007.jp2	/asm0400/image/2007.jp2

The century had been  indeed one of marvels. For a few moments I must consider  the character of the men who wrought these marvels and the  progress they made in conquest.  Spain's long oppression of the Moor had left its mark  on the Spanish character.  Tis said that the prerogative of  the Christian Spaniard seemed to be to appropriate the fruits  of other people's labor. As for Portugal, her training had  been quite as bad. As early as 1440 Portuguese ships had  raided the African shores.  Captured Moorish pirates were  allowed to go free in exchange for mort tractable blacks,  and the King received his fifths in iiiory and hides and slaves.  It was inevitable indeed that slavery of the Redmen in  America should begin at once. During the first years any  adventurer was permitted to set sail and every "tailor adventurer" (the historian says) swarmed to the quest. Doubtless  a general riff raff and refuse of humanity along with the  noble Spanish lords and captains.  Hardly choice colonists were such men as these I Yet they  essayed with feverish zeal.  On the islands food soon became  scarce - Columbus himself proposed the plan of shipping a  load of wild Caribs as slaves to Spain in exchange for food.  Thus, he said, the other milder tribes would be conciliated,  and besides the Caribs might be converted in Spain and in time  return as missionaries.  But hostility spread rather than decreased among the  natives - foraging for food was necessary, however, and the  plan was devised of exacting tribute (a little at a time four  times a year), a small brass token being hung about the  nativefs neck as a receipt.  Then, in lieu of this tax or  tribute, service was accepted.  Inan incredibly short time  the service of whole villages was demanded.   The territory  was divided up into districts (repartimientos) and let out to  individuals or to companies.  Once this practice established, there was no limit to the  barbarous cruelties inflicted. Children were drowned like  puppies, refractory natives roasted alive, maimed or killed  by the hundred, and this (we shudder to read it) in honor of  Christ and his twelve apostles.  There is a story of one Ov-  ando.  Wishing to make short work of some unruly cheiftains-  le entrapped them under the pretence of showing them some games  nd a tournament. All were assembled in a wooden house,  ,oldiers surrounding it, while Ovando with his badge on his  "east (an image of God the Father) explained the nature of  e tournament.  Touching the badge was signal for the sol-  ers to rush in, seize and bind the chiefs.  Then leaving  5m, the house was set afire and they were burned alive.  m  '.

There is no more inspiring strain than  this life of unselfish aim admist all the greed and strife and  arrogance of the common run.  Thus in the inscrutable medley  of human life, the highest and the lowest are revealed.  Among the English heroes of the Spansh Main, and the ha  hordes of freebooters hovering, lurking and darting among the  haunts of Spain like birds of prey, there were also all sorts  and conditions of men.  Gentlemen adventurers, ambitious courtiers, spendthrift  sons of fortune; never a set less adapted for the sober business of governing a subject race. Fiske says "Thev were  boastful and brave -unflinching, enrelenting, unforgiving  yet with an intensity and wholeness of purpose which is the  pith and marrow of great deeds."  Sir Thomas Cavendish, who, as marauder, beat even Drakes  record, writes - "I made great spoils, I burnt and sunk 19  sail of ships. All the towns and villages I landed at I  burned and spoiled".  He slaughtered Indians, devastated  crops and laid hands on symbols of Christianity to destroy.  The religious fanaticism of Spain found indeed its match in  the wild passion of the English to down the Spanish dog.  Antipathy between Protestant and Catholio was at white  heat, and if Spain*felt an angry alarm at the New World  being defiled by Protestant heresy and her rich trade usurped  as well, the English gave good reason.  To break the Catholic monopoly, to kill Spaniards, to sell  negroes, to sack gold ships, was to them a seemly work for the  elect of God.

They were a cheerful race, and when  blessed with a few crowns and reasonable booties ever ready  to take heart thof half dead."  There are three localities in South America which  stand out prominently as associated with the most daring  and noteworthy explorers, viz:  The Straits of Magellan,  The Isthmus of Panama.  The great river courses of the Amazon and Orinoco.  I shall consider these localities in turn.  MAGELLAN .  Of all theexplorers after Columbus, none can compare  with Magellan - this first world-circling voyage was as  unique as Columbus1 triumph, and in extent and danger a  far greater feat.   Magellan not only bridged the great  gulf between Bur ope and Asia, bixt bridged the gulf in  men's minds, dispelling the illusion of any short cut to  Cathay and revealing for the first time the true proportions of our mother earth.  Ferdinand Magellan was but a child when Columbus  returned in 1492.  Born in 1480 among the wild, gloomy  mountains of Portugal, in a remote province whose people  were all noted for their tough and rugged character, there  was never a sturdier came forth than Ferdinand Magellan.  Hever daunted by the stress of fate, danger seemed but to  call forth efforts well nigh superhuman.  With all his power there was nothing cruel in his nature;  in spite of the sorest trials he was ever kind and generous.  As a youth he volunteered in the service in Eastern waters.  Anxious sailing and wild fights with Arabs and Malays were  his training.  He was with the first ship that ever ventured  east of Ceylon and thus knew wellthe geography of the Eastern islands. A bosom friend named Serrano, whose life he  one time saved, had remained in the East, getting as far as  the Moluccas,-and it became Magellan's dream to join his  friend.  Failing to recover any damages for an injury to his  knee, which lamed him for life, and failing also to gain  the Portuguese King's aid in further undertakings, he re-  V  j  *s.

His deep study and long pondering had caused him to conceive the plan of circumnavigating the globe, of finding that  longed for passage thro the land, and then on to the Moluccas  and Serrano I      Charles V favored his shceme and gave him  5 ships, all old and worse for wear, to be sure. There were  280 men aboard, a motley crew of every nation, blacks and  Malays included.  The King of Portugal, jealousy now possessing his soul, tried to thwart the voyage - he ordered  spies to waylay and stab Magellan, and sent word to the East  Indies to have him arrested should he ever get there.  In  fact treason was already lurking aboard his ship. Among his  own captains but one remained faithful-? this was another Serrano - the brother of his far away friend.  The fleet sailed. Magellan had left a young wife and  6 months baby.  The wifes father, learning from rumor of  the danger threatened, sent after him to give him warning.  Mutiny soo# broke out, but was promptly quelled, the guilty  captain being struck down and put in irons.  Again and again  there were mutterings, until at last, after reaching Brazil  and coasting South, spending weeks in convincing themselves  that there was no sea opening at La Plata, where Solis and  his friends had sorrowfully met death, passing down the Pat-  agonian coast, where the intense cold compelled them to seek  a winter harbor - on a fateful Easter Sunday the climax came.  Rations were short, the rebellious captains wished to  give up and go home - Magellan remained firm as a rock; for  him hardship was only made to be despised and danger laughed  at.  In spite of the cunning and desperate plans of the  mutinous men, Magellan was a match for them. One captain was  beheaded on a gibbet ashore, another put in irons, and a third  later on, undercover of the winding strait, stole away to Spain.  From April to August 24 they wintered over in this "Port  St- Julian".  On the 21st of October they entered a deep arm of the sea -  was this indeed the longed for passage? The water remained  salt.  There were great high mountains covered with snov/ on  each side. Deep hidden bays and labyrinthine tv/ists led on  and on - the water ever deep and salt.  The conviction grew  that this was the strait.  Again the mutinous men arose, protesting that their dis  covery was now made - it was enough; rations were again short -  "Let us return to Spain" they said.   Magellan in quiet measured tones replied that, as xor him, he would go on to do his  work if he had to eat the leather off the ships arms.  After more than 5 weeks sailing thro 400 miles of winding  channel, they came out upon the open waters "the first that  ever burst into that silent sea".  They named the headland  Cape Desire.  Men wept for joy - but alas and alas, worse was  yet to come.     Month after month they sailed over this new,  trackless sea of Darkness, with scant and decaying food,  hunger and scurvy thinned their ranks.  It must have seemed like a fathomless abyss towards which  they were being led, rather than the good round globe Magellan  had conceived, but mutiny was of no avail now - Magellan the  /	85471160 Bytes	4877	5840	1032279668	RGB	8	600	asm04000001500106001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/2010	2010	2011.jp2	/asm0400/image/2011.jp2

Sighting only a few bleak island  rocks, obtaining a little food here and there, they reached  at last the Robber Islands (named the Ladrones ever since)  and soon afterwards the Philippines, where white traders  from Siam and China had been before.  Then Magellan knew  what he had accomplished. But the hour of victory was brief.  His own good nature and his devout religious fervor was his  undoing.  A chief with whom he made an alliance professed  eagerness to embrace Christianity, having learned to admire  the feats and accomplishments of white men.  In a weeks time there was a bonfire of heathen idols,  a cross was set up and the entire populace baptized - but  now the chief desired to make use of his newly aoquired  religion.  There was a neighboring refractory chief to be  subdued and converted.  Of course the beloved ally would  assist I   A crusade was oni  Magellan was not one to  flinch.  This was but part of life's duty, to serve God  and do his duty.  They crossed over to the enemy's island - overwhelming numbers of savages quickly routed them, Magellan lingering to the last, while others ran, was struck down and in the  quaint words- of the Italian chronicler, "the Indians threw  themselves upon him with iron pointed bamboo spears and  scimitars and ran him through, our mirror, our light, our  comforter, our true guide - until they killed him".  30 mvn were massacred. As the sad remnant sailed off  from the Philippines the convert chief was seen "chopping down  the false cross, making amends for apostasy to his irate gods"  The forlorn little fleet upon reaching Molucca found  Serrano, the idolized friend of Magellan, dead, murdered  about the very sane time as Magellan. One of the two remaining vessels sprung a leak and the lone "Victoria" made haste  around Cape of Good Hope, sadly crippled, with only 47 men  aboard.     It looked as tho1 none might reach the goal to  tell their marvellous story. At last 18 gaunt and haggard  survivors sailed into port.  The voyage had lasted *3 years. Magellan's child was  dead, and learning the fate of her husband, the wife "grievously sorrowing" had also passed away that self same month.  Uone of Magellans family remained to receive recognition,  but the story of his surpassing voyage and the simplicity and  grandeur of his life, with nothing that has to be explained  away, will be an inspiration forever.	87332724 Bytes	4936	5896	1695216844	RGB	8	600	asm04000001500107001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/2011	2011	2012.jp2	/asm0400/image/2012.jp2

Six years before Magellan's discovery of the new ocean  Balboa had obtained his f^rst glimpse of it from the mountain  ridge on the Isthmus.     Balboa, who is in reality a most  engaging and attractive character, makes his undignified appearance on the scene as a stowaway in a barrel, a penniless  cavalier who thus contrived to escape his creditors.  Recalling that the north coast of South America had been  divided up between colonizers, who, as we also recall, promptly  set to fighting and quarreling with each other, we find Balboa  on board a ship from Hispaniola, bound with recruits and food  for a forlorn band that had well nigh perished on the shores  of the Bay of Uraba - one Francisco Pizarro being in charge  of it.  Balboa happened to have knowledge of the shores, and  advised his superiors to choose the west shore of the Bay for  landing because here the natives did not use poisoned arrows.  So they did, and this was the beginning of Santa Maria del  Darien.  They were really so far west that they were now in a  rival's province, whose headquarters were at Hombre de Dios  where a block house had been built. But alas for the poor  colonists.  Of 700 men only 70 remained alive and the commander, saddened by hardship, was, when found, so the story  runs, "of all living men the most unfortunate, in manner  dryed up with extreeme hunger, filthe and horrible to behold."  Thus it would seem that there was nothing muc$ to fear  from such a fallen rival - and it all ended by Balboa's being  chosen to command at Darien, not without a due scattering of  envy and enmity we may be sure.   He forthwith began to explore the Isthmus. Seeming a good sort of thing to do, he  married a native Indian girl, and thus the more easily made  friends with the chiefs, who, anxious to oblige their white  friend, and knowing the white man's god, told him of a country  far to the south, over the hills, along a great sea, where  there was gold enough for all - where the people made their  cups and bowls of gold, so plentiful was it.  He set out with 200 men and a pack of bloodhounds, and in  3 weeks time the Indian guide led him to a bold summit whence  he saw a "waste of waters".  It must have been a solemn moment even to a worldly gold seeker.  It took 4 more days to  reach the shores of the new sea (Gulf San Miguel).  Always making friends with the natives he was again and  again assured of the true land of gold to the south, which  they called the "Biru Country" (hence ,TPeru" from a chief  named Biru).  Meantime, before he had time to return to Darien  with the great news, rumor had reached Spain of the new golden  land, and another governor was appointed, one Pedrarius. Gay  and daring cavaliers swarmed aboard with him, liko the pirates  they were.	84723632 Bytes	4861	5808	3955678921	RGB	8	600	asm04000001500108001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/2012	2012	2013.jp2	/asm0400/image/2013.jp2

His arrival was followed of course by friction  and jealous faction, which a wily old conciliatory Bishop  who was with the colony, thought to abate by having Balboa  sent to visit the golden kingdom of "Biru" and by way of  cementing a friendship with Pedrarius he proposed that Balboa  should marry the Governor's daughter.   irobably the worthy  Bishop thought that an Indian wife didn't count.  Balboa, however, was of another mind, for he was devotedly fond of his little Indian girl - but as the other young  lady was in Spain and there was therefore no haste in the  matter, he gave his consent.  In order to sail down the coast of the great new sea,  it would be necessary to carry their ships over the mountains.  Four ships, piecemeal, of course, were painfully transported  on the poor Indian's shoulders^  Such a herculean task is  almost inconceivable when we know the character of those  rugged mountains and tropical jungles, but they kept at it,  and the fleet with 300 men was made ready to weigh anchor.  Heeding a little "pitch and iron" to take with them, a  delay occurred - a delay fatal to poor Balboa, who was thus  robbed of a still greater renown that might have been his,  but for the demon of treachery,     Someone had whispered  to Pedrarius that Balboa meant to usurp the office of Governor  and that he never had intended to marry his daughter, anyhow;  Pedrarius therefore sent a crafty letter asking Balboa please  to return over the hills and talk with him on important business.  Unsuspecting, Balboa set out and his fate was sealed.  A company of soliders met and surrounded him and led him to  his doom; and before the sun went down he and four friends  were tried, comdemned and beheaded.  At the head of the band that met him was his onetime  friend Pizarrol   Sad irony of fatel But for this trifle  of !!pitch and iron", Balboa and not Pizarro would or might  have been the conqueror of Peru.  ), the pity of it!  His  bright attractive figure and his sad untimely end throw a  glamor about this most romantic episode.  It was Pedrarius afterwards who founded Panama 1519  (the oldest continuous settlement in America) and who built  a rude road across the Isthmus to "Nombre de Dios"*  This  highway, the very oldest of transcontinental routes, soon  became famous as the route for the pack trains bearing the  wealth of Peru, and bearing too, the freight of Spanish  ships that began to trade with the far off Philippines, and  famous still it is in the days of Roosevelt, as witnessing  the forcing of a passge thro the land, since nature had  denied it.   But at first and for a long time after Balboa,  men little knew how far this sea extended. Excursions were  sent west and north - Hicaraugua with gold aplenty was found -  but hunt as they might, never  did those Spioe Islands show up.  It was not until after Magellan's voyage had taught men how  far off Asia really was, that efforts were renewed to find  the southern mines in the Biru country.

Not until 1530 was  the final successful expedition accomplished.  RIVERS.  11  The gentle Inca people quailed before the bearded  strangers, coming out of the sea clad in glistening armor,  riding unearthly monsters fas they deemed the horses) and  weilding thunderbolts.     Peru was won.  The lion had  seized its prey.  Shrines and treasure houses were rifled  and rich ransom collected from the paralyzed natives. High  sounding, beneficent decrees of Popes and Christian sovereigns were empty of meaning.     According to a 3 months  reckoning, the spoils amounted to fiftenn millions of dollars  and how the spoils were taken is one long tale of woe.  A brother of Francisco Pizarro carried the Emperor's  share to Spain. The arrival of such fabulous treasure  roused the greed of fresh hordes of odious demons, who  sallied forth and the story of bloodshed and oppression, with  domestic fued and intrigue goes on.  Reports of a great  river to the East and of more fabulous wealth besides were  current in Peru.  It seems, so the story went, that in the very year of  Pizarro's conquest (1530) a man named Martinez, who was  expelled from the rankst had fallen into the hands of people  who had blindfolded him and led him to the city of "Manoa"  and here showe him a large inland lake or sea, where annual  rites were performed of throwing in golden treasures and  showering gold upon their leader.  From here Martinez escaped and made his way down the Orinoco and sailed to Porto  Rico, and there the story spread and grew, and was the self  same myth which Raleigh heard and could not resist.  Tis a  phantibm which meets us at every turn in the story of Anerica.  Gonzalo Pizarro, one of the Pizarro brothers, had been  left in charge of the Province of Quito.  His men  were uneasy-  so in order to give them employment, he went on a quest for  cinnamon in the forets far to the East.   In 1538, starting  with 350 men and 4000 Indians, he crossed the Andes and plunged deeper and deeper into the forest wilds, ever lured on by  reports of a rich land beyond.    Reaching a broad river he  built a boat, and thus, partly by water, partly by land, took  his unweildy party further and further from hone, down what  proved to be one of the tributaries of the Amazon.  Food growing scarce, one Francesco de Orellana was commissioned to go to where the rich country was with 50 men and  bring back supplies.     Orellana went but found no supplies.  Thinking each day that he might discover something worth  while (it being easy besides to keep on down stream and very  difficult to return against the current), he basely deserted	88885128 Bytes	5004	5919	1601106190	RGB	8	600	asm04000001500110001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/2014	2014	2015.jp2	/asm0400/image/2015.jp2

Now it happened that one of Orellana*s men had refused  to go along with the band of deserters and was left in the  woods to starve, but he was found by Pizarro, for whom then  there was nothing left but to return to Quito, and a most  terrible march it was with his starving men, over the mighty  Andes again.  Two-thirds of his company perished by the way.  Napoleon's crossing the Alps was a small feat by comparison.  The desire to find a highway for Peruvian treasurer shorter  thanthat via Panama rermines still paramount, and besides,  that story of the golden lake, as the monk historian relates  "Keeps all our spirited youth of Peru in a state of unrest -  so' please Ood deliver us from this uncertainty."  It was nearly 100 years after Orellana's fearful descent of the Amazon that two monks set out from O.uito, and  reaching the mouth as he had done, determined to clear up  all doubts by returning the way they came.    th 47 canoes,  70 soldiers and 1E00 Indians, the voyage lasting a year,  they reached Quito, where there was great rejoicing.  A most entertaining description of the great river was  written by one of the priest historians, whose naive credulity  however, only served to perpetuate stories of Amazons and other  myths.

We are asstired of the marvellous benefits of the climate because the "hosts" (holy wafers) which  he carried with him, remained fresh for 5 months or longer.  One of his conclusions at least has been echoed ever  since and we may be sure contains more fact than fiction, viz:  ^hat "Except for the plague of mosquitoes, this country might  e proclaimed to be one vast paradise".

His  two ships were well stored and equipped like men of war. He  set sail for "llombre de Dios" direct, where the golden harvest  brought from Peru and Mexico was stored until it could be  shipped to Spain.   It was calledT?She Treasure House of the  World".     Drake slid into a good hiding place (picked out  beforehand), disembarked his small boats (pinnaces) and under  cover of darkness, surprised the town.  His trumpeters were  scattered and were told to sound their trumpets at a given  signal, as thof a large force had taken possession.   The  rase succeeded.  Ordering a Spanish prisoner to lead the  way, he made straight for the Governor1s house; here the long  trains of pack mules came to unload the gold and jewels.  The men had a tantalizing sight of this great treasure, but  meantime, Drake, sorely wounded, had swooned away, a downpou r  or rain had wet their bowstringa and retreat was in order.  In leaving the harbor, they managed at least to capture a  ship with her cargo of wines, which was some compensation  doubtless for missing "The Treasure of the World".  Subsequent exploits soon made up for this first poor  haul.  Roving along the coast many Spanish ships were seized  and relieved of cargo, mostly victuals bound for "Mombe de Dio  This was welcome provender and various secret storehouses were  stocked ashore.  Drake's next plan was to waylay the pack trains as they  came over land.    Climbing the hills he came to a place  where from the top of a tree he too, like Balboa before him,  could view the Southern sea.  Spies had been sent ahead to  bring news of the pack trains^ As the jangling bells of the  mules came near they ambushed in the grass - but again, the  master thief let slip the price.  Still another expedition  fell far short of brilliant gain, tho t?ae men were getting  their full share of excitement, but a third attempt was all  that could be desired in the way of plunder.  Three trains  of 190 mules were raided and rapidly unloaded of all that  could be carried, say 57,000 lbs. of precious gold and metal.  The hard return march to the coast was made, when a shocking  surprise awaited them - no boats were to be seen!  Instead a  small Spanish fleet cruising about.  Hastily constructing a raft, with biscuit sacks for  sails, Drake and a few volunteers pushed off in search of  the missing boats. Up to their armpits in the surge of waters  after six hours under a parching sun, the boats turned up in  hiding, and finally all the men and treasixre were safely got  aboard.  It was now best to hasten home, tho1 they took time  enroute to capture various frigates and added them to their  fleet.  They arrived in Plymouth on a Sunday during "sermon  time". "So speedily did the news pass all over the church,  and fill the minds with desire and delight to see him, that  few or none remained with the preacher, all hastening to see  the evidence of Godfs love and blessing towards the gracious  Queen and country".  s"  t	87887996 Bytes	4913	5961	1406140327	RGB	8	600	asm04000001500113001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/2017	2017	2018.jp2	/asm0400/image/2018.jp2

Drake's share of the  plunder had made him rich again. When he was presented to  his "gracious queen" she managed adroitly to incite him to  fresh attack on Spain's colonies, for tho' nominally at peace,  the bitter enmity of the two sovereigns was ill concealed.  With utmost secrecy plans were laid for this the greatest of all Dfake's voyages.  Constantinople, men said, was  to be the goal, but it was pretty generally suspected that  Drake was after the same old spoil and the same old foe in  Spanish America.  Even Spain got wind of it and doubled her guard of the  "Treasure of the World".  However, Drake had other schemes.  With no scorn for booty (0 nol) he yet cherished now another  ambition, which was to sail on that great ocean he had viewed  from the tree top on the Isthmus.   That way lay Peru and  who could say what beside!  Preparations for this voyage were most elaborate -  nothing was omitted. He took with him a council of young  lords; they all dined together off silver plate to music of  violins.  Ther£ were draughtsmen and secretaries, and every  known luxury.  They set sail in 5 ships in 1577. As they approached  Brazil the fires of the natives were observed, which they  knew to be appeals to the gods to send storms or cause the  ships to run on shoals and wreck the hated white men, and in  fact they narrowly did escape shipwreck. Running south,  they found Magellan's winter port and thought they saw the  gibbet of Magellan's traitor captain.  After pious ceremonies they entered the strait, Drake's  ship "The Pelican" being re-christened, in honor of the occasion "The Golden Hind".     They passed thro in 16 days and  came to the "sea of their desire".    Storms instead of  smooth seas greeted them and drifted them about for 53 days,  during which time Cape Horn and the whole group of Tierra  del Fuego were discovered.  The fleet was separated and the  "Golden Hind" at last was left to go on alone.  Learning on  an island where they stopped, of a rich ship from Peru, Drake  promptly sailed in the direction thereof.  At Valparaiso the  ship was found.  Here Drake and his men were received as  Spaniards - but an impatient sailor soon gave them away, with  his insulting epithets, so they quickly rifled the town and  towed their prize ship away.  Again and again they landed, and again and again and  always there are tales of bars and widges of silver, tales of  wine and every  spoil.  In Oallao, there were a dozen ships without sail - all  were held up and rifled and then, hearing of an especially  rich ship, Drake cut the cables of the dozen ships, setting  them adrift without sail, and gave chase to the famous  "Spitfire", called also "The Glory of the Southern Seas", a  richly laden ship bound for Panama.   Silver and everything  else was captured. Whereupon it was said the ship would now  have to change her name and be "Spit Silver",- "Spitfire" no  longer.	87382252 Bytes	4952	5880	23142695	RGB	8	600	asm04000001500114001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/2018	2018	2019.jp2	/asm0400/image/2019.jp2

Here, feeling at last that spoil  enough was won and revenge satisfied, he took council with  his lords, and fearing to retxirn by the way he came, he  boldly set sail westward for the Moluccas and Spice Islands,  having hints from strange maps and pilots of this route,  and remembering how Magellan over 50 years before had  "ploughed a furrow 'round the globe".  Incidentally his ship was driven north, where hs discovered the Californian and Oregon shores, claiming them for  England.  In two months time the Golden Hind reached the  Philippines and other islands, where the native kinds celebrated the event with gorgeous ceremonies and much honorable  entertainment.  After an absence of 3 years they reached the home port.  It was a momentous event.  The freight of precious wares  and the amazing tales of adventure stirred all England.  Drake's daring and the two and a half millions of spoils  carried from the Pacific coast round the world could not  fail to arouse enthusiasm and lure fresh freebooters as well.  There were, however, also critics, who condemned and  stirred up clamor against him. But as time went on clamor died  out. As a banquet on board the "Golden Hind" the queen solemnly knighted him.     His ship was preserved for 100 years  and from its parts a chair was made and is preserved at Oxford.  Drake kepy on harassing Spain, capturing galleons, burning  ships, or as he called it, "singeing the King of Spain's beard"  to the very end.   Lastly as at first, he was with Hawkins  on the Spanish Main, and here in 1595, aboard his ov/n ship  near "Hombre de Dios" he died, after more than 25 years  marauding.  m	86731984 Bytes	4856	5952	3397516570	RGB	8	600	asm04000001500115001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/2019	2019	2020.jp2	/asm0400/image/2020.jp2

Richard Haki^-t, Recorder, "a quiet, bookish man", was  really the moving spirit in all this period of promotingcolo-  nization. He is desoribed as "a man of self-chosen obscurity,  content to listen and remember, indefatigable in research and  of enormous industry, a zealot of the map and of the flag".  It was his writings as well as Drake's exploits that  awoke all England to her neglected opportunities. He was  ever writing and lecturing - appealing to Elizabeth's pride  and taunting the English for their backwardness. His ardent  patriotism and quaint style is very taking. He was an investor, too, in the schemes of Sir Humphrey Gilbert, Frob-  isher and Raleigh - and when Raleigh's star set, 'twas his  influence that carried to completion the Jamestown settlement.  The Colony idea had appealed to Raleigh and we know what  a bold and picturesque figure he is in the early history of  North America, but perhaps his heart was even more in his  South American project, as it was more ambitious and" romantic,  since "El Dorado" was once more the goal.  In 1593 he first planned the voyage to where he believed  gold mines surpassing those of Peru would be found.  In 1594 he made a preliminary examination of the Pearl  Coast and of the Orinoco River.  In 1595 he sailed himself with 5 ships full of gentlemen adventurers.   When they reached the river there was a  perilous trip, full of adventure, in small boats up as far as  some impassable falls.  Upon his return he wrote a tract called "The Discovery  of the large, rich and beautiful empireof Guiana", which was  a glowing description embellished with tales of wonders and  riches galore.      He tells how every stone in the forets  of the Orinoco shines and glistens like previous metal and  with a characteristic touch of di&plomacy and flattery he  describes the transports of the natives at sight of Queen  Elizabeth's picture, and he dwells upon the"warlike women"  of this far country.  But this luxuriously equipped voyage and several others  for the relief of his Virginia colony about exhausted his  means, and fortune still frowning, he was condemned to die.  Confined 13 years in the Tower, he never lost his ardor for  colonizing, writing meantime his famous "Historie of the World".  Finally, for the very special purpose of making another  expedition to Guiana, King James released him upon lis pledge  to find the fabulous gold mine or else bear all the expenses  of the trip.

It was a forlorn hope, for his plans  had been betrayed in Madrid.  His fleet of 14 ships was attacked and his son killed. He himself was ill of a fever at  Trinidad.  The disaster and the death of his beloved son  broke even his stout heart.   Upon returning minus the treasure, he was re-arrested and again thrust into the Tower.  Perhaps you recall his brave words at his execution--  "Prithee let me see the axe, dost thou think, man, I am  afraid of it?  fTis a sharp medicine but a sound cure for all  disease".  In closing I will remind you that all these events transpired before the Puritans sailed.  Thus in point of age South  America ranks first. For 100 years Spain had set her seal  and laid the foundations of a lasting civilization.  There were blots indeed in those early days, but 'tis  not for us to cast stones, for the trend of historical studies  emphasizes more and more that many points of difference fexist in  the Latin American character, but serve to painfully reveal  our own shortcomings.  Let us hope that the discovery of these shortcomings  may help to lead us onward toward that ixnion of nations and  of races which is the goal of an universal world democracy.	86641856 Bytes	4837	5969	1134979035	RGB	8	600	asm04000001500117001.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/2021	2021	2022.jp2	/asm0400/image/2022.jp2

KIRK    MUNROE  Emerson says "What we need is  someone to make us do what we  can." Now that is what the club  does for us, not what we want to  do, but what we can-  I have been studying the effect  club work has upon women, and I  can conscientiously say it has always  been gooi. Even in amusement  clubs, for they have their broadening  influence, which is everything in a  woman's life. But I mean working  clubs, where women come togetherto  not only better themselves, but  homes, and the town in which they  live, and Florida has at least twenty  five of such clubs.  Of course we make mistakes and  will do, for we have had to learn  how to do things, outside of our own  front door, as it were. How to work  but in doing so we are fast growing  out of that slur that indifferent women as well as men have been wont to  fling "Oh they do nothing but gossip." Today no educated, thinking  woman ever gossips, at or about her  club. I really feel this to be true.  If there is such a member she is sure  to be the fault finder, the one who  never attends a business meeting is  backward with her dues and is the  last one to make a full sized cake for  the club tea. Such a woman should  not belong to the up-to-date club of	28004660 Bytes	2310	4038	3050994839	RGB	8	600	asm04000001500121011.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/2038	2038	2039.jp2	/asm0400/image/2039.jp2

She  should join the rocking chair set-  although as a clever woman once suggested that it was a sign of awakening for such a woman to even wish  to be among the workers, and that  putting up with such was perhaps as  good missionary work on the part of  the club women, as getting a pure  food bill or child labor law passed.  Women who have never worked in  a club are apt to undervalue the importance of formal methods. "Why  can't we just talk it over amongst  ourselves." I have heard more than  once, and in every case the matter un  der discussion was never settled, because there was no fixed rule to go  by. but personal feelings, which in a  matter of serious import counted for  nothing.  If a woman has to rise and be  recognized by the president and then  speak before a roomful of women,  she is going to be a bit more careful  what she says than she would be  sitting in a corner and talking it  over. The right to the floor gives  a certain dignity to the simplest remark and remember you hold your  audience first by courtesy, then by  curiosity,   and   last   by   interest.  Ten years ago, perhaps even less,  there was nothing so common among  women as to make rules and then  utterly disregard them, that was because we were just learning how, for  one of the great uses of the womans  club life is to train women to work  in an organized way, to do what she  can,  as well as she  can.  Never vote without being perfectly  sure what  you  are  doing.

It is just as bad form to do  this during a club meeting as at other gatherings that require strict attention.  Do what you say you will do of  the club work. Do not make your  club meetings public ones by utterly  disregarding the small courtesies of  life for every person present should  be   known,   or   vouched   for. The  door of our club house should be  jealously guarded for anyone admitted is your equal there. You  have publicly declared her so by  admitting her and you are in honor  bound to treat her so.  If any of us give an afternoon  reception what is it we expect from  departing guests, certainly a gracious  farewell, and in this sense a club  meeting takes the place of a home  gathering. The officers have gone  to the trouble of arranging a program, of seeing that the room is in  order an I planned for your comfort  an=l pleasure, and certainly it is a  very gracious act, not to think it a  duty to say good afternoon, and yet  it is one of the commonest neglects  in connection with club work. Of  course it takes time and sometimes  management, so it did to prepare  the afternoon for your enjoyment.  "I did not think the club would  have done that" is sometimes said  by a careless member. Now I won-  der how many of us appreciate our  individual responsibility in every  club act. That is one reason for always being prompt at business meetings.	26490056 Bytes	2203	4005	2323328820	RGB	8	600	asm04000001500121031.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/2040	2040	2041.jp2	/asm0400/image/2041.jp2

That is a woman's way if it is her  club, and she will stand for it, but  every once in a while one will hear  a woman "talking of" or making fun  of her club or some member who has  not happened to please her. I once  heard such a woman entertaining  some people at a hotel table with an  account of how the club secretary  had read the report and of how a  new member who did not know the  form of putting a question had addressed the chair. I never shall forget the look that came in the men's  faces as she progressed and when  she had eventually finished one of  them said, "And you belong to that  club." But we are fast growing out  of the objectionable features of what  is called womens gatherings, and  especially the "hurt" feeling. No one  can be liked by everyone and nothing is so narrow than this relic of  old secluded lives that we are working out of.  Although the country is full of  clubs for women, there are still a  great many women who do not know  how to value or appreciate this  agent in their mental development.  It brings her in close contact with  minds equal and sometimes superior  She grows ashamed of her narrowness. She learns that other women  know even her method of bread-making and child training and that  some of the members of her club  may have been to Rome and Venice,  even if she has not. In fact, the  club is the good friend that will  make her do what she can.  The club also trains her in self-  reliance.

How queer our voices  sounded and how cold our hands  and feet got before we had finished  with  "Madam   President I move."  The club is an open door for all  sorts of information for mutual help,  in fact, we can not be a club woman  of today, without gaining in every  way.  Now there are many kinds of club  women, but remember this, everyone  wants, I believe it, wants to do her  share, even those who join protesting they can not take any part in  the club work. They always do in  some way.  Never smib a new member that  wants to work. Their first work is  always well done, and unless you  have studied it, you cannot realize  how much the new member does.  She usually comes in feeling she is  going to show us all how to do  things. Well, let her. She certainly will accomplish something, and if  you can not help her and guide her-  let her alone, for anyone capable of  work very soon finds out just what  can be done.  Of course, there are professional  club women, not that they are paid,  but they are usually women entirely  foot-free, with a comfortable income  To such women the club means everything. They know parliamentary  rules by heart, they never make a  mistake in addressing the chair. I  know one such member, who told  me her club dues were $80 a year  for. she belonged to several clubs.  She never misses a meeting of the  General Federation, and she understands the language of the club as  perfectly   as   some   of   us   do   baby	27771828 Bytes	2284	4050	1921847763	RGB	8	600	asm04000001500121051.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/2042	2042	2043.jp2	/asm0400/image/2043.jp2

She does not  know just why, but it is the thing.  She is of use in her way, because  she dresses well and always comes  when there is something extra going  on; when the officers want a good  attendance. &gt;She   pays   her   dues  promptly and lets the working department of the club alone, and she  never finds  fault.  Then there is the member who  knows the club's constitution and bylaws by heart. Such a member is  extremely useful." if she is kindly.  But we are all apt to come to our  feet with "Madam President, that's  not constitutional" if parliamentary  law happens to be our particular  gift, and many times this is right,  but sometimes it happens that conditions alter cases and following the  by-laws might be the very worst  thing possible for the work in hand.  Such cases must be left to the President, for she alone knows or ought  to know the condition of every case  and  the ability  of every  member.  Remember I am speaking of small  clubs, of working clubs. A club  member with parliamentary law at  her tongue's end. should always be  a  vice-president.  A member who knows that a certain thing is to be voted upon that  she does not approve of. and then  stays away from the meeting or  goes to it and does not protest, and  then goes out and talks about what  should have been done, is neither  honest to herself or her club. If one  can not help then have the good  form to keep quiet- You might  have spoken and did not.

Then there is the dear merry member, who is always willing to serve  tea, or arrange flowers or do anything of an afternoon. She is always a little late. She never attends a business meeting and never  knows anything about anybody that  is not perfectly  delightful.  And there are women who belong  to clubs and never do anything in  any way. never attend a meeting, or  subscribe a cent beyond their dues,  they do not even criticise the President, they don't even ask for a year  book, and in contrast to such is the  member who does too much. If  every member of a club does her part  if it is only to arrange the window  shades of the clubroom, and does  her part promptly and well, that is  all that can be asked, for there is  certainly work for every member in  a club if only to cheer those who are  working by prompt attendance and a  ready expression of _ pleasure. The  member who answers "Yes" or  "No" at once to request from officers and fulfills her answer is a great  comfort to a club.  And remember that an opinion,  even if it is a foolish one, when asked  for,  is better than none.  The uncertain member who is never sure, what she can, or cannot do,  is a thorn in the flesh- She usually  does do what is asked, but you may  count on her always—even against  her wish to do so—going with the  majority. Such a plan usually has  its  reward.  The biggest and best thing about  a club woman is loyalty, loyal to her  club, to her president, to the officers  and every member.

Many women have overdone, and  suffered in consequence, and many  have undertaken what was impossible to do, but I have never heard  one regret her experience, for it has  often opened up a new life, and given her new friends, that she has not  dreamed of, in fact, discovered her,  to herself.  And one other important thing to  do, to do well, and that is answer  letters. At the last meeting of the  State Federation, unanswered letters was the universal complaint,  from the officers, and chairmen of  committees. A practicable club  woman will keep a desk especially  for her club work, and on it every  thing ready to answer club work letters. In the State manual, the  President of the Federation makes  this appeal in the notes "Will the  club women make it a rule to answer all letters promptly?" and one  other thing, do noc wear too new or  tight gloves at a club meeting. Then  you can easily acknowledge the  pleasure you feel towards those who  have done what they could- Often  times it is the only and the best  thing a club member can do to express promptly and heartily appreciation of work done for other's entertainment. And do not fail to secure your club's year book and read  it often, so as to keep informed of  what your club is doing even if you  do not help in the doing. It is not  right to be ignorant of what women  are doing or trying to do.  MRS.

Sep*     81—-08  Economies |  Household  _0J)_0_0_  If you were to ask the average matron, if she practiced househol  economy, she would no doub.t answer in the affirmative.  The question arises , how many of us have deeply studied and  really mastered* this science.  True Household economy can not be  taught in a day, but must  be aqulred from youth; for instance - children ( and I fear often  need  grown persons)   be taught, not to leave victuals upon their  plates to waste,but should be taught to ask for only as much  as they can consume*  We^in the United States,are a very prosperous people often  lavish ! , which in turn has a tendency to make us very wastefull  and, as far as economy is concerned— I at times fear it is  rapidly1 becoming a lost art; for have you not often heard  foreigners claim that well to do families of their own national^;  could live off the waste of the average American family*  Fortunately economy is often forced upon us , necessity beiag  the mother of invention.  In the daily routine of our household duties , we are apt to  tudy out , and sometimes we stumble upon many little  actices tending to economy.  .19	93383428 Bytes	5166	6024	2073602277	RGB	8	600	asm04000001500136011.tif		2013-02-27	2013-02-27	http://merrick.library.miami.edu:80/cdm/ref/collection/asm0400/id/2095	2095	2096.jp2	/asm0400/image/2096.jp2

We may economize by stiching eyelets,  be the same in a fancy shirt waist , or in the seat of our  eight year old yavifrfotk trousers»  When in a hurry to remove the lid from the boiling pot, did you  ever stumble over the broom ? well next time have your dear  hubby bore an eyelet in the end of the handle and ,hencforward  t— -  hang it on its designated place,but hang it there always so you  can find it in the dark if necessary, and you will find in  adflition, your broom will last mucl^ longer.  A small waste basket placed in a convenient corner of the  kitchen need only be emptied once in two or three days, hence will  save many trips to the trash heap.  Having a place for everything and every thing in its place  eeonomlsestfery much in time , in fact to practice true houshold  economy requires not only close study , but still closer application , otherwise our better halves earnings , be they ever so  liberal , will disappear faster out of the back door , than he  can bring them in the front one.
