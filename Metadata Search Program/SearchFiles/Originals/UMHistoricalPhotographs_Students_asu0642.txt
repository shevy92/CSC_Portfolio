Merle Blount modeling a creative use for a bandanna				Printed on paper attached to verso: "PICTURE 1, POSE A; THE PROVERBIAL TRIANGLE (model, Merle Blount, ZTA) If you are one of the many college students who got caught in the swirl of buying a fabulous amount of bandannas a few years back, try this trick. Find three that either match, blend or contrast effectively, and assimilate them thus for a pinafore: a. Gather one slightly, or pleat for the skirt, b. Affix the apron to the waist band (the waist band being the second bandanna folded Red Cross bandage style to tie in the back), c. Split the third square diagonally and fold each piece Red Cross bandage style to form the two suspenders. Other stunts with left over triangles are to make book carriers and slings as seen in the picture, or book covers for special notebooks, and little collapsable [sic] bags to carry your wallet and glasses."
