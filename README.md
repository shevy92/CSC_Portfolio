-*Metadata Search Program was a java program I built for the UM Richter Library Digital Collections Department. 
I work there as a web development assistant. The program takes a text file that contains a lists of metadata items, 
and searched through it for missing item numbers. It then exports the results as an excel file. I created the program solely,
from start to finish.
